All of the show's episodes are rated TV-Y for "all ages".
Season one

Season one opened with a "preview", an early screening of the entire first episode five days before the series "officially" started, to coincide with the launch of the television channel The Hub. The introduction of the characters and the plot revolving around Nightmare Moon span over the first two episodes, which together comprise the only two-parter of the season. Episode three introduces the Grand Galloping Gala, which is where the season's final episode takes place. The show's developer, Lauren Faust, served as executive producer for this season. All of season one's episodes are rated e/i for "educational and informative".

This season focuses mainly on Twilight and her getting used to Ponyville as well as the cementing of the friendship between the Mane Six as well as the Cutie Mark Crusaders in the latter half of the seasons.
Season two

Faust announced that she has been less involved in the making of the show for season two, focusing mostly on story conception and script. She is credited under "Developed for Television by" and "Executive Producer" for the first and second episodes, which were produced during the first season's production span. She is credited as "Consulting Producer" for the rest of season two.

The season consists of 26 episodes, 22 minutes in length. Several minor characters return in this season, including Derpy, Princess Luna, and Mr. Greenhooves, as well as the school-age ponies, Cheerilee, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders. The season started airing on September 17, 2011. Like the first season, it opened with a two-parter with the ponies questing for the Elements of Harmony. Episodes 11, 12, and 13 were not aired in production order episode 13, Hearth's Warming Eve, was aired before episodes 11 and 12, Family Appreciation Day and Baby Cakes, respectively, to be in time for the holiday season. They are listed on the wiki according to air date order. Season two has concluded on April 21, 2012 with the two-parter finale, A Canterlot Wedding.

Starting with the episode Lesson Zero, Princess Celestia exempts Twilight from submitting a report every week, and asks that all six ponies make reports about their findings on the magic of friendship when they come upon them, which reduces the show's emphasis on Twilight's friendship lessons.

To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth, but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness Nightmare Moon.
     
    Narrator She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both... 
    Narrator and Twilight Sparkle ...sun and moon... 
    Twilight Sparkle ...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where? 

     

    Twinkleshine There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on. 
    Twinkleshine  Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony. 

    Spike Ow! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Spi-ike! Spike? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for? 
    Spike Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing. 
    Spike But we're on a break! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no, no... no, no, no!  Spike! 
    Spike It's over here! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see Mare in the Moon? 
    Spike Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal!  Spike! Do you know what this means? 
    Spike No-- whoa! 
     
    Spike Ow! 
    Twilight Sparkle Take a note please, to the Princess. 
    Spike Okie dokie. 
    Twilight Sparkle My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster! 
    Spike Hold on. Preci... preci... 
    Twilight Sparkle Threshold. 
    Spike Threh... 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle. 
    Spike Twilight Sparkle. Got it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Great! Send it. 
    Spike Now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! 
    Spike Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away! 
    Spike Impera... impera... 
    Twilight Sparkle Important! 
    Spike Whoa! 
     
    Spike Okay, okay!  There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath... 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle See? I knew she would want to take immediate action. 
    Spike  My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hm! 
    Spike ...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Spike My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete make some friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return. 
    Spike Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said? 
    Twilight Sparkle She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends. 
    Royal guards  
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you, sirs. 
    Royal guards  
    Spike Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try! 
    Twilight Sparkle Um... hello?

    Rainbow Dash  You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.

    Spike Well, what do you wanna know? 
    Fluttershy Absolutely everything. 
    Twilight Sparkle

    Spike ...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today? 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes, please!

    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
    Ponies Surprise! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     

    Pinkie Pie Surprise! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all "hello" and I was all , remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went ! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends! 
     
    Applejack Are you all right, sugarcube? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Aww, she's so happy she's crying! 
    Spike "Hot sauce". Ooh...

    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale... 
    Spike C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise! 

    Pinkie Pie Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited-- well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went  but I mean really, who can top that? 
     
    Mayor Mare Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration! 
     
    Mayor Mare In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria... 
    Fluttershy Ready? 
    Mayor Mare ...Princess Celestia! 
    Rarity Huh? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle This can't be good. 
    Mayor Mare Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding? 
    Rarity She's gone! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, she's good.  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no... Nightmare Moon! 
    Spike  
    Nightmare Moon Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious, little sun-loving faces. 
    Rainbow Dash What did you do with our Princess?! 
    Applejack  Whoa there, Nelly... 
    Nightmare Moon  Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty-- 
    Nightmare Moon Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs? 
    Twilight Sparkle I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon â€“ Nightmare Moon! 
     
    Nightmare Moon Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're here to... to...  
    Nightmare Moon  
     

     
     

Friendship is Magic, part 2

     

    Twilight Sparkle "Elements of Harmony, see 'Mare in the Moon'"? 
    Spike But that's just an old ponies' tale. 

    Twilight Sparkle She will bring about nighttime eternal. 

    Twilight Sparkle It's imperative that the princess is told right away. 

    Twilight Sparkle See? I knew she would wanna take immediate action. 

    Spike My dear Twilight. There is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends. 

    Pinkie Pie  

    Twilight Sparkle All the ponies in this town are crazy! 

    Twilight Sparkle I hope the Princess was right. 

    Rarity She's gone. 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh no. Nightmare Moon! 

    Nightmare Moon  

     

    Nightmare Moon  
    Mayor Mare Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is! 
    Nightmare Moon Stand back, you foals!  
     
    Applejack Ergh... 
    Rainbow Dash Come back here!  Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going? 

    Spike Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!... 
    Twilight Sparkle You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony? 
    Rainbow Dash And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa! 
    Applejack Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do! 
    Pinkie Pie "The Elements of Harmony A Reference Guide." 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you find that?! 
    Pinkie Pie  It was under "E"! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now-- 

    Everypony The Everfree Forest! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee! Let's go! 
    Twilight Sparkle Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own. 
    Applejack No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple. 
    Everypony  
    Pinkie Pie Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle So, none of you have been in here before? 
    Rarity Ugh, heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful. 
    Applejack And it ain't natural. Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's that supposed to mean? 
    Rainbow Dash Nopony knows. You know why? 
    Applejack Rainbow, quit it. 
    Rainbow Dash 'cause everypony who's ever come in has never come out! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy! Quick! 
    Fluttershy Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack Hold on! I'm a-comin'! 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack! What do I do? 
    Applejack Let go. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you crazy? 
    Applejack No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not true! 
    Applejack Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yaaah! Phew-wah! 
    Fluttershy Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two. 
     

    Rainbow Dash And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta-  A manticore! 
    Manny Roar  
    Twilight Sparkle We've gotta get past him! 
    Rarity Take that, you ruffian! 
    Manny Roar  
    Rarity My hair! Woop-- 
    Fluttershy Wait. 
    Manny Roar  
    Applejack YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie. 
    Fluttershy Wait. 
    Manny Roar  
    Applejack Whoa! All yours, partner. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm on it. 
    Fluttershy Wait! 
    Manny Roar  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow! 
    Manny Roar  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy WAIT! 
    Manny Roar  
    Fluttershy Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby. 
    Rainbow Dash Little? 
    Fluttershy Now this might hurt for just a second. 
    Manny Roar  
    Everypony Fluttershy! 
    Manny Roar  
    Fluttershy  Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are. 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you know about the thorn? 
    Fluttershy I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness. 

    Rarity No. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally. 
    Twilight Sparkle That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it. 
    Rarity I didn't see you there, my apologies. 
    Rainbow Dash Right here... guh... 
    Applejack Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'. 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack It's just mud. 
     
    Applejack Aah! 
     
     

     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Everypony Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh girls, don't you see? 

    

        When I was a little filly and the sun was going down... 

    Twilight Sparkle Tell me she's not... 

    

        The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown... 

    Rarity She is. 

    

        I'd hide under my pillow 
        From what I thought I saw 
        But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way 
        To deal with fears at all 

    Rainbow Dash Then what is? 

    

        She said, "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall 
        Learn to face your fears 
        You'll see that they can't hurt you 
        Just laugh to make them disappear." 

        Ha! Ha! Ha! 

    Ponies  

    

        So, giggle at the ghostly 
        Guffaw at the grossly 
        Crack up at the creepy 
        Whoop it up with the weepy 
        Chortle at the kooky 
        Snortle at the spooky 

        And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh... 

        Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuugh! 

     
    Pinkie Pie How are we gonna cross this? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Huh? 
    Steven Magnet  What a world, what a world. 
    Twilight Sparkle Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying? 
    Steven Magnet Well, I don't know. I was just sitting here, minding my own business, when this tacky little cloud of purple smoke just whisked past me and tore half of my beloved mustache clean off, and now I look simply horrid.  
    Rainbow Dash Oh, give me a break. 
    Applejack That's what all the fuss is about? 
    Rarity Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales. 
    Steven Magnet  I know. 
    Rarity And your expertly coiffed mane. 
    Steven Magnet Oh, I know, I know. 
    Rarity Your fabulous manicure. 
    Steven Magnet  It's so true! 
    Rarity All ruined without your beautiful mustache. 
    Steven Magnet It's true, I'm hideous! 
    Rarity I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected. 
    Steven Magnet  What did you do that for? 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, what are you- 
    Steven Magnet  Oh-hohohoho! My mustache. How wonderful. 
    Rarity You look smashing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail... 
    Rarity Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back. 
    Rainbow Dash So would the mustache. 
    Twilight Sparkle  We can cross now. Let's go. Ah! 
    Steven Magnet Allow me. 

    Twilight Sparkle There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it! 
    Applejack Twilight, wait for us! 
    Twilight Sparkle We're almost there. Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash What's with you and falling off cliffs today? 
    Pinkie Pie  Now what? 
    Rainbow Dash Duh. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh yeah. 
    Shadowbolt Leader Rainbow... 
    Rainbow Dash Who's there? 
    Shadowbolt Leader Rainbow... 
    Rainbow Dash I ain't scared of you! Show yourself! 
    Shadowbolt Leader We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria. 
    Rainbow Dash Who? 
    Shadowbolt Leader Why, you, of course. 
    Rainbow Dash Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever. 
    Shadowbolt Leader No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, The Shadowbolts. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent- 
    Rainbow Dash Yep. 
    Shadowbolt Leader Swiftest- 
    Rainbow Dash Yes. 
    Shadowbolt Leader Bravest flyer in all the land. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes,  it's all true. 
    Shadowbolt Leader We need... you. 
    Rainbow Dash WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal. 
    Shadowbolt Leader No! It's them or us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them. 
    Shadowbolt Leader Well? 
    Rainbow Dash You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no. 
     
    Rainbow Dash See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'. 

    Applejack Whoa. Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for? 
    Twilight Sparkle The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful! 
    Pinkie Pie One, two, three, four... There's only five! 
    Rainbow Dash Where's the sixth? 
    Twilight Sparkle The book said when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed. 
    Applejack What in the hay is that supposed to mean? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen. 
    Applejack Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate. 
    Twilight Sparkle Aah! 
    Everypony Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle The Elements! 
     

    Applejack Twilight, where are you? 
    Rarity Look! 
    Applejack Come on! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Nightmare Moon  
    Twilight Sparkle  Hmph! 
    Nightmare Moon You're kidding. You're kidding, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah! 
    Nightmare Moon No, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle  But... where's the sixth Element?! 
    Nightmare Moon  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here. 
    Nightmare Moon What? 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! 
    Twilight Sparkle And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! 
    Twilight Sparkle The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us. 
    Nightmare Moon You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work! 
    Twilight Sparkle But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element the element of... magic! 
    Nightmare Moon Nooo! Nooo! 

    Rainbow Dash Ugh, my head. 
    Applejack Everypony okay? 
    Rarity Oh, thank goodness. 
    Fluttershy Why Rarity, it's so lovely. 
    Rarity I know! I'll never part with it again. 
    Fluttershy No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark. 
    Rarity What? Ooh. So does yours. 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie Look at mine! Look at mine! 
    Rainbow Dash Aw yeah. 
    Applejack Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship. 
    Princess Celestia Indeed you do. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Princess Celestia. 
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it. 
    Twilight Sparkle But... you told me it was all an old pony tale. 
    Princess Celestia I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna! 
    Princess Luna  
    Princess Celestia It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash Sister? 
    Princess Celestia Will you accept my friendship? 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 
    Princess Luna I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister! 
    Princess Celestia I've missed you, too. 
    Pinkie Pie  Hey, you know what this calls for? 

    Pinkie Pie A party! 
     
    Princess Celestia Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them. 
    Princess Celestia Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before. 
     

    Pinkie Pie Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went  but I mean really- 

     
     

The Ticket Master

    Spike No. Nope. Nope--  
    Applejack Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of Granny's girdles.  
    Twilight Sparkle No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry. 
    Spike I know, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh-wee, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked. 
    Spike Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Eh, I guess we better get some food. 
    Spike Nope. Worm. A-ha! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh Spike, that looks delicious. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike. 
    Spike What?  
    Twilight Sparkle It's a letter from Princess Celestia. 
    Spike  Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest. 
    Applejack and Twilight Sparkle  The Grand Galloping Gala! 

     

    Applejack and Twilight Sparkle The Grand Galloping Gala!  
    Applejack Woo-hoo! 
    Spike  Look, two tickets. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike? 
    Spike No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense. 
    Twilight Sparkle Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice. 
    Applejack Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip. 

    Applejack Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, well in that case, would you like to-- 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa!  Ugh. Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala? 
    Applejack Rainbow Dash. You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing? Spyin'? 
    Rainbow Dash No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, but-- 
    Rainbow Dash YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash! 
     
    Rainbow Dash I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild! 
     
    Rainbow Dash The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member. 

    Rainbow Dash Don't you see, Twilight? This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. You gotta take me!  
    Applejack Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.  I asked for that ticket first. 
    Rainbow Dash So? That doesn't mean you own it. 
    Applejack Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket. 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think? 
    Applejack Drummin' up business for the farm? 
    Rainbow Dash A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts? 
    Applejack Money t' fix Granny's hip. 
    Rainbow Dash Living the dream. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they?  Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay? 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash Okay.  

    Spike So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat? 
    Pinkie Pie  Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?! It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go! 

    

        Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 
        Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 
        Hip hip 
        Hooray! 
        It's the best place for me 
        For Pinkie... 

    Pinkie Pie With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and piÃ±atas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony! 

    

        Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 
        Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 
        'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever 
        In the whole galaxy 
        Wheee!! 

    Pinkie Pie Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever. 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, actually-- 
    Rarity  Are these what I think they are? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-- 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot. 
    Rarity The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him. 
    Pinkie Pie Him! ... Who? 
    Rarity Him. I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, "Who is that mysterious mare?" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, "Yes!" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is  what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams. 

    Rarity Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph. 
    Spike Hey! 
    Fluttershy  Angel, these are perfect. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to. 
    Rarity and Pinkie Pie You haven't? 
    Fluttershy Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else-- 
    Rarity You? You want to go to the gala? 
    Fluttershy Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos! 

    Twilight Sparkle Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...? 
    Rainbow Dash Wait just a minute. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! Were you following me? 
    Rainbow Dash No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody. 
    Applejack Wait just another minute. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, were you following me too? 
    Applejack No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket. 
    Rainbow Dash Your ticket? 
    Pinkie Pie But Twilight's taking me. 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle QUIET! 
    Pinkie Pie And then I said, "Oatmeal, are you craz--" oh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Girls, there's no use in arguing. 
    Rarity But Twilight- 
    Twilight Sparkle Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise...  not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow. 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Savoir Fare Have you made your decision? 
    Twilight Sparkle I CAN'T DECIDE! 
    Spike Twilight, he just wants to take your order. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich. 
    Spike Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you think, Spike? 
    Spike I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones? 
    Twilight Sparkle I mean about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take. 
    Spike Oh. You're still on that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I-- 
    Savoir Fare Ah, your food. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat. 
     
    Savoir Fare Em, madam? Are you going to eat your food in ze rain? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not raining... What's going on? 
    Rainbow Dash Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather? 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, what are you doing? 
    Rainbow Dash Whaddya mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you? 
    Rainbow Dash Me? No no no, of course not. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. 
    Rainbow Dash Seriously, I'd do it for anypony. Heh heh, eh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, fine.  
    Twilight Sparkle That's better.  
    Rarity Twilight, it's raining. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, really? 
    Rarity Come with me before you catch a cold. 

    Twilight Sparkle Heh heh, oops, sorry. 
    Rarity Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... 
    Rarity Makeovers! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight. 
    Rarity There. Oh, you're simply darling. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it? 
    Rarity And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent. 
    Spike D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, Spike. 
    Rarity Now you just need a hat. 
    Spike Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk. See you back at the library. 
    Rarity  Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait, the Grand-- 
    Rarity  and Twilight Sparkle, of course. 
    Twilight Sparkle I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch. 
    Applejack Did somepony say lunch? 
    Twilight Sparkle You've got to be kidding me! 
    Applejack I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack Is that a yes? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh! 
    Applejack So, that's a maybe? 

    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating. 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle  Fluttershy, not you too? 
    Fluttershy Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's summer. 
    Fluttershy Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're not doing this for the ticket, are you? 
    Fluttershy Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right, Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
    Ponies SURPRISE! 
     

    

        Twilight is my bestest friend 
        Whoopie, whoopie! 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie... 

    

        She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony! 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie. 

    

        I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party! 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! 

    

        She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me! 

    Twilight Sparkle PIIINKIIIE!! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket. 
    Drizzle Wait, what ticket? What gala? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! 
    Ponies, in unison The Grand Galloping Gala?! 
     
     
    Daisy Would you like any help with your gardening? 
    Shoeshine I have a cartload of extra carrots. 
     
     
    Spike What are we gonna do? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're... gonna... run! 
     
     
     
     
    Spike Ugh... Warn me next time you're gonna do that. 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't! 
    Applejack Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise. 
    Fluttershy Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful. 
    Pinkie Pie And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends. 
    Rarity Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha,  I got the ticket, I got the ticket-- you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either. 
    Applejack We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you. 
    Ponies in unison We're sorry, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala. 
    Ponies in unison What?! 
    Twilight Sparkle If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either. 
    Applejack Twilight, you don't have to do that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now. 
    Spike  
    Fluttershy Now you won't get to go to the gala either. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all. 
    Spike Hgh... hgh... urk... urk... 
    Applejack Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment. 
    Spike  
    Applejack Whoa Nelly! 
    Twilight Sparkle A letter from the princess? That was fast. 
    Spike "My faithful student Twilight, 
    Why didn't you just say so in the first place?" Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Now we can all go. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity Allow us to treat you to dinner. 
    Rainbow Dash What a great way to apologize. 
    Pinkie Pie And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me. 
    Spike How come I don't get a ticket to the gala? Hurk!  
    Applejack  

     
     

Applebuck Season

    Applejack Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own. 
    Applejack Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end. 
    Big McIntosh Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of. 
    Applejack Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies? 
    Big McIntosh But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to... 
    Applejack Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself.  

     

    Applejack Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no. 

    Rainbow Dash STAMPEDE! 
     
     
    Sweetie Drops Stampede! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  This makes my voice sound silly! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run! 
    Mayor Mare Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic. 
    Rarity But Mayor, whatever shall we do? 
    Rainbow Dash Look there! 
    Applejack YEEHAW! 
     
    Applejack Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl! 
    Winona  
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.  
    Applejack Come on, little dogies! Turn!  
    Winona  
    Applejack Attagirl.  Yee haw! 
     
    Applejack Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about? 
    Daisy Jo  Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes. 
     
    Daisy Jo And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know. 
    Applejack I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville. 
    Daisy Jo We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona! 
     
     
    Applejack Yee haw! 
    Pinkie Pie Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony! 
    Mayor Mare Applejack was just... just... 
    Pinkie Pie Appletastic! 
    Mayor Mare Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town. 
    Pinkie Pie I know. 

    Pinkie Pie A party! 
    Twilight Sparkle We all ready? 
    Rarity Just one last thing. Now we're ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is Applejack all set? 
    Rainbow Dash Actually, I haven't seen her all week. 
    Pinkie Pie Not since the stampede. 
    Rainbow Dash But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late. 

    Twilight Sparkle Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to-- 
    Rainbow Dash Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. And... 
    Pinkie Pie This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time. 
    Twilight Sparkle What does that have to do with Applejack? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter-- 
    Fluttershy Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle --rupted. 
    Fluttershy Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills. 
    Twilight Sparkle Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind. 
    Mayor Mare Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend Applejack! 
     
    Spike Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh. 
    Mayor Mare Ah-ahem. 
    Spike Awkward. 
    Applejack I'm here. I'm here.  It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo. 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-ooo. 
    Applejack Ooo-ooo. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony. 
    Applejack  Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little-- 
    Rainbow Dash Tired? 
    Fluttershy Dizzy? 
    Rarity Messy? Well, did you see her mane? 
    Pinkie Pie She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm. 

    Applejack  O-oah. 
    Twilight Sparkle What on Earth is that pony doing? 
    Applejack Whoops. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey Applejack! 
    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack. 
    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack. AppleJACK! 
    Applejack Oh, howdy, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle What is all this? 
    Applejack It's Applebuck season. Whoa. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applewhat season? 
    Applejack Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em. 
    Twilight Sparkle But why are you doing it all alone? 
    Applejack 'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself. 
    Twilight Sparkle What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help? 
    Applejack  They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work? 
    Twilight Sparkle Fine. 
    Applejack Could you step aside, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good. 
    Applejack Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa. 
    Twilight Sparkle Do you... want some help? 
    Applejack Help? No way, no how. 
    Twilight Sparkle But there's no way you can do it all on your own. 
    Applejack Is that a challenge? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhm... no? 
    Applejack Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck. 

    Rainbow Dash There you are. 
    Applejack  I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours? 
    Rainbow Dash See this contraption? 
    Applejack Uh... Yeah. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts. 
    Applejack Isn't that a mite dangerous? 
    Rainbow Dash Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly. 
    Applejack Well, all right-y then. Oh my. 
    Rainbow Dash Ready? One... two... THREE! 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end. 
    Applejack Got it.  
    Rainbow Dash Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete! 
    Applejack You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this.  Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! 
    Applejack Heh heh... Here I go! 
    Rainbow Dash Wait, Applejaaaaack! 
    Applejack You're welcome! 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Can I help you? 
    Rainbow Dash I think somepony else needs your help. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack? 
    Rainbow Dash Yep. 

    Applejack Ow! 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk? 
    Applejack Can bees squawk?! I don't think so. 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Can we talk? 
    Applejack Twenty stalks? Bean or celery? 
    Twilight Sparkle No! I need to talk to you. 
    Applejack You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you? 
    Twilight Sparkle I need to talk to you! 
    Applejack Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about? 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today. 
    Applejack That's quite neighborly of her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air. 
    Applejack Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning. 
    Twilight Sparkle Because you're working too hard and you need help. 
    Applejack What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed. 
    Twilight Sparkle HELP! You need HELP! 
    Applejack Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. 

    Mrs. Cake Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack? 
    Mr. Cake No? You're not the best baker ever? 
    Applejack WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye. 
    Mrs. Cake  All right. Well, see you later, girls! 
    Pinkie Pie Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'. 

    Pinkie Pie All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips? 
    Applejack Eh, uh, whu, what was that? 
    Pinkie Pie Chocolate chips. 
    Applejack Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next? 
    Pinkie Pie Baking soda. 
    Applejack Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what? 
    Pinkie Pie A cup of flour. 
    Applejack A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie One last thing. Wheat germ. 
    Applejack Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms. 
    Pinkie Pie Now that's gonna be delicious. 
    Applejack If you say so. 

    Pinkie Pie Free muffin sample spectacular! 
     
    Applejack Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot. 

    Twilight Sparkle We came as soon as we heard. 
    Nurse Redheart Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! What happened? 
    Spike  
    Nurse Redheart It was a mishap with some of the baked goods. 
    Pinkie Pie No, not baked goods, baked bads.  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack. 
    Spike  Want one? 

    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, we need to talk. 
    Applejack Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight.  I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not to upset your applecart, but you need help. 
    Applejack Hardy har.  And no I don't. 
    Twilight Sparkle Here, let me help. 
    Applejack Help? No thanks. . 
    Twilight Sparkle AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree. 
    Applejack I knew that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and-- 
    Applejack You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle But if you'd just let me help-- 
    Applejack Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle No offense. 
    Mule None taken. 

    Fluttershy Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup. 
    Applejack Ugh. Why are we doin' this? 
    Fluttershy Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families. 
    Applejack Fine. Can we just get on with it? 
    Fluttershy Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently. 
    Applejack I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona? 
    Winona  
    Fluttershy Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle. 
    Applejack That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona! 
    Winona 
    Fluttershy Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them. 
    Applejack We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies. 
    Winona  
    Fluttershy Oh no. 

    Rainbow Dash STAMPEDE! 
    Daisy  Stampede! 
     
     
    Lily Valley  

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rose The horror, the horror. 
    Lily Valley It was awful. 
    Daisy A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't get it. 
    Lily Valley Our gardens, destroyed. 
    Rose Every last flower, devoured. 
    Daisy By... by... THEM! 
    Fluttershy Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness. 
    Twilight Sparkle All right. Enough is enough. 

    Applejack Must  more. Must finish harvestin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help. 
    Applejack  Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples? 
    Big McIntosh Um, how do you like them apples? 
    Applejack  

    Twilight Sparkle Applejack. Applejack. 
    Applejack Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you. 
    Applejack Okay, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I am not taking "no" for an answer--what? 
    Applejack Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer. 

    Your faithful student, 
    Twilight Sparkle 

    Applejack How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!  Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn. 
    Twilight Sparkle A bit? 
    Applejack Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends. 
    Rainbow Dash Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry. 
    Spike And I've got the perfect treat. 
    Pinkie Pie Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them? 
    Spike From the trash. 
    Ponies  EW! 
    Spike Just a little nibble? Come on. 
    Ponies Ew! Gross! 

     
     

Griffon the Brush Off

    Pinkie Pie Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. 
    Pinkie Pie And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. Phew. 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash  Pinkie Pie? Not again. 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Not now, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie But, but Rainbow Dashâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash I'm in the middle of something. 
    Pinkie Pie Butâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash I said not now-- 
    Pinkie Pie I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain. 
    Rainbow Dash  

     

    Pinkie Pie  Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere? 
    Twilight Sparkle Isn't she right up there? 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash  

    Rainbow Dash Phew. That was close. 
    Pinkie Pie Hi! 
    Rainbow Dash Aah! 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie Hi again. 
    Rainbow Dash Aah! 

    Pinkie Pie Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Waaa--oh, forget it. 
    Pinkie Pie I totally promise it'll be totally fun. 
    Rainbow Dash  Okay. 

    Pinkie Pie Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the-- 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal. 
    Spike  
     
    Spike D-aah!  
    Pinkie Pie  Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Spike  Nnaa-- 
    Pinkie Pie Oh no, you're not hurt are you? 
    Spike Ne-- fire-proof. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, okay, good. 
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Spike I wish the same thing  were true with scrolls. 
    Princess Celestia  
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?  
    Rainbow Dash I can think of one thing. 
    Pinkie Pie Aah!  
    Rainbow Dash I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you  
    Rainbow Dash You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash You wanna hang out? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash A simple nod would do. 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm-hmm. 

    Rainbow Dash Is she even home? 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know. This is gonna be gold. 
    Rainbow Dash There she is. 
    Rarity Ooo.  
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie Aaa-choo! 

    Twilight Sparkle Hmm? 
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  

    Applejack  Land sakes! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
     
    Applejack  

     
    Pinkie Pie Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt? 
    Rainbow Dash  Fluttershy. 
    Pinkie Pie WHAT?  Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, you're right.  Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh,  The toughest around. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them? 
    Pinkie Pie  You're very close. 
    Rainbow Dash  Good one, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash Ridiculous. 

    Pinkie Pie  Rise and shine Rainbow Dash! It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to-- Ooh. 
    Rainbow Dash Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie. 
    Gilda Hey. What's up? 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda. 
    Pinkie Pie What's a griffon? 
    Rainbow Dash She's half-eagle, half-lion. 
    Gilda And all awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right. 
    Rainbow Dash Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant? 
    Gilda Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head. 
    Rainbow Dash Sooo... 
    Gilda Ugh. Only for you, Dash. 
    

        Junior Speedsters are our lives, 
        Sky-bound soars and daring dives 
        Junior Speedsters, it's our quest, 
        To someday be the very best! 

    Pinkie Pie  Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game? 
    Gilda Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. Um, well sure, no problem. Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you--  

    Gilda and Rainbow Dash  
    Gilda Whoa, that was sweet. Just like old times. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, only faster. So now what? 
    Pinkie Pie Hey there. 
    Gilda and Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie It's later. And I caught up. 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie, you are so random. 
    Gilda Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud? 
    Rainbow Dash A race? You are so on. 
    Gilda One, two, three, go. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! 
    Rainbow Dash I win. 
    Gilda As if. I won, dude. 
    Rainbow Dash No way. 
    Gilda Yes way. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you. 
    Gilda Uh, I don't think so. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh Geez, dream on. 
    Gilda Remember back in camp? Iâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash There is no way you beat me. 
    Gilda Whatever. 
    Pinkie Pie Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather. 
    Rainbow Dash Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G. 
    Gilda Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. Go!  I think the high altitude is making you dizzy. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time. 
    Gilda So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school? 
    Rainbow Dash New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while. 
    Gilda Hey Pinkie, c'mere. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah? 
    Gilda Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF. 
    Pinkie Pie  Whaaa-aaaâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption? 
    Gilda Eh, she left. Something about being as busy as a bee. 
    Pinkie Pie Hmph! 

    Twilight Sparkle So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean? 
    Pinkie Pie Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda. 
    Twilight Sparkle You know what I think, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie Hmm? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I think... you're jealous. 
    Pinkie Pie Jealous? 
    Spike Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude. 
    Pinkie Pie Improve my attitude? But I... D... B.. It's Gilda that... D... Are you seri...  
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Pinkie Pie Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants.  

    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash  That was sweet. Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya. 
    Gilda That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down. 
    Rainbow Dash Later. 
    Granny Smith  Aaah! A rattler, a rattler! Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves! 
    Gilda This stuff ain't fresh, dude. 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess. 
    Gilda  
    Pinkie Pie  I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke. 
    Fluttershy All right little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear. 
    Gilda Hey. 
    Fluttershy Please excuse me. 
    Gilda I'm walkin' here. 
    Fluttershy Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to... 
    Gilda  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus? 
    Fluttershy B-b-b-but I... I... 
    Gilda  
    Fluttershy  
    Gilda Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail. 
    Pinkie Pie She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style. 

    Pinkie Pie Welcome, welcome. Welcome! 
    Applejack Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about? 
    Rarity I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare. 
    Twilight Sparkle You've met Gilda, right? What's she like? 
    Fluttershy Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight. 
    Pinkie Pie Welcome. Welcome. 
    Fluttershy Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I meanâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of. 
    Fluttershy I'm a year older than you. 
    Pinkie Pie Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk. 
    Gilda  
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream. 
    Gilda Yeah  uh, good one, Pinkie Pie. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends. 
    Gilda Right behind you Dash. I know what you're up to. 
    Pinkie Pie Great. 
    Gilda Rrrh. I know what you're planning. 
    Pinkie Pie  Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party. 
    Gilda I mean, I've got my eye on you. 
    Pinkie Pie And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Please help yourself. 
    Gilda Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. HOT! 
    Rainbow Dash G, the punch. 
    Gilda  Huh? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass. 
    Rainbow Dash Ha. Priceless. Priceless.  
    Gilda  Yeah, hilarious. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey G, look, presents. 
     
    Applejack Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month. 
    Gilda Ha ha. I bet I know who that was. 
    Pinkie Pie You do? 

     
    Pinkie Pie Cake time everypony. 
    Spike Hey, can I blow out the candles? 
    Twilight Sparkle Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike? She is the guest of honor after all. 
    Spike Ugh. 
    Gilda Exactly.  
     
    Gilda  
    Spike  Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic. 
    Pinkie Pie Now, I wonder who could've done that. 
    Gilda Yeah, I wonder. 
    Spike Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike. 
    Spike What? It's great, try some. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you? 
    Gilda No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on then, let's have some cake. 
    Gilda Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk. 
    Pinkie Pie Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon? 
    Applejack Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play. 
    Rarity Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail? 
    Gilda Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded. 
    Gilda Hey what-- ugh-- what are you doing? Rrrah. 
    Pinkie Pie We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. 
    Gilda  Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait. The poster is this-- 
    Gilda Whoa whaa waah waah waaaaah  
    Pinkie Pie Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end. 
     
    Gilda  This is your idea of a good time? I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life. And Pinkie Pie, you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks. Did you really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together. Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene. Come on Rainbow Dash. I said, we're leaving. 
    Rainbow Dash You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party. 
    Gilda  What? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh. 
    Rainbow Dash So I guess I'm queen lame-o. 
    Gilda Come on, Dash, you're joshing me. 
    Rainbow Dash They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off. 
    Pinkie Pie I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it. 
    Gilda No way. It was Pinkie Pie. She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me. 
    Pinkie Pie Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down. 
    Rainbow Dash And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else. 
    Gilda Rrgh. Yeah? Well you, you, you are such a, a flip-flop cool one minute and lame the next. When you decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call.  
    Rainbow Dash Not cool. 
    Spike Wow, talk about a party pooper. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, what was that about? 
     
    Merry May Um, what just happened? 
    Pony Really awkward. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business. 
    Rainbow Dash I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings? 
    Pinkie Pie No hard feelings. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you. 
    Pinkie Pie It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Dearest Princess Celestia, 
    Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light. 

    Your faithful student, 
    Twilight Sparkle 

    Princess Celestia Dear Twilight Sparkle, 
    My most faithful student... Oh! Heh, wrong ink.  

     
     

Boast Busters

    Spike Come on, Twilight. You can do it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, here goes. 
     
    Spike Ha ha! Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number twenty-five. Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting. And I think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache.  
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go. 
    Spike Wait! Aw, rats! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Spike Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents! 
    Twilight Sparkle True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic? 
    Spike Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me. 
    Spike Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight. 
    Snails Gangway! Comin' through! 
    Spike Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on? 
    Snails Wha, haven't you heard? 
    Spike Whoa! 
    Snails There's a new unicorn in town! 
    Snips Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever! 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Spike Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Where is this unicorn? 
    Snails Ho, she's in the town square. Come on! 
    Snips Yeah!  Come on! Whooo! 

    Trixie Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie! 
    Audience Ooh! 
    Trixie Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes! 
     
    Rarity My, my, my! What boasting! 
    Spike Come on, nopony's as magical as Twiâ€” Twiâ€” Twiâ€” Oh!  Hey, Rarity, I, uhâ€” Mustache! 
    Twilight Sparkle There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there? 
    Applejack Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons. 
    Rarity Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us. 
    Rainbow Dash Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us.  Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo! 
    Trixie Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria? 
    Rarity  Just who does she think she is? 
    Spike Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here isâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Shhh! 
    Spike What? What's wrong? 
    Twilight Sparkle You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off. 
     
    Rainbow Dash So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway? 
    Trixie Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major! 
     
    Audience Ahh! 
    Snips What? 
    Snails No way! 
    Trixie When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in, and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest! 
    Snips and Snails Saw, sweet! 
    Snips That settles it. 
    Snails Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville. 
    Snips No, in all of Equestria! 
    Spike How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twiâ€”  Mmph! M-mmph! 
    Trixie  It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville. 
     
    Trixie Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?  Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!? 
     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially sinceâ€” 
    Trixie Hmm, how about you? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     

    Trixie Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't? 
    Twilight Sparkle Iâ€” Iâ€” 
    Trixie Well, little hayseed? 
    Applejack That's it! I can't stand for no more of this! 
    Spike You show her, AJ! 
    Applejack Can your magical powers do this? 
     
    Audience Whooo!  
    Applejack Top that, missy. 
    Trixie Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie! 
     
    Applejack Whoa! Uh! 
    Audience  
    Trixie Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails. 
    Rainbow Dash There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that. 
    Trixie Oh? 
    Rainbow Dash That's my job! 
     
    Rainbow Dash They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'! 
    Audience  
    Trixie When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a!  gonna be sick. 
    Trixie Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ow! 
     
    Spike What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss. 
    Applejack A real unicorn to unicorn tussle. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... 
    Rarity Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace. 
    Trixie Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane? 
    Rarity Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style. 
    Audience Ooh! 
    Rarity A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty. 
    Spike Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she'sâ€” 
    Audience  
    Rarity Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair! 
    Twilight Sparkle Nothing. 
    Rainbow Dash It's fine. 
    Applejack It's gorgeous. 
    Spike It's green. What? 
    Rarity Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair!  
    Golden Harvest Well, I never! 
    Spike Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you mean? I'm nothing special. 
    Spike Yes, you are! You're better than her! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not better than anyone. 
    Trixie Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go. 
    Spike Twilight? 
    Trixie Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt? 

    Snips Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it. 
    Snails Mmm, hay. 
    Trixie  Yes? 
    Snips Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie. 
    Snails Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major. 
    Trixie Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning. 
    Snails Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie. 
    Snips Anything you say. We are at your beck and call. 
    Trixie Ah. 
    Spike What are you two doin'? 
    Snips Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee aâ€” 
    Spike The what? 
    Snips The Great and Powerful Trixie. 
    Spike Sheesh. 
    Snips Just bringin' her a smoothie. 
    Spike How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, whoâ€” 
    Snips The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that? 
    Spike Oh really? Were you guys actually there? 
    Snips Well, eh, uh... no, butâ€” 
    Spike But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding. 
    Snails  I like pudding. 
    Spike Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you! 
    Snips Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? 
    Snails Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas? 
    Snips Yeah, uh... oh, come on! 

    Spike Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me? 
    Twilight Sparkle Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends. 
    Spike It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Spike, it's exactly the same. 
    Spike Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie. 
     
    Spike But you're the best! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh. Please, Spike, I said no! 
    Spike  If that's the way you want to be, then fine. 
     

     
    Snips Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face? 
    Snails Hold on.  
    Snips Oh, heh. That's better. 
     
    Snails Yaaaah! 
    Snips Yaaaah! 
    Ursa  

    Snips  
    Spike Hey, guys, where ya goin'? 
    Snails  
    Snips Can't talk now. 
    Snails Got a major problem! 
    Snips Yeah, ursa major, to be exact. 
     
    Spike Huh? 
    Ursa  
    Snips and Snails Trixie! 
    Spike Twilight! 

     
    Snips and Snails Trixie!  
    Trixie Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed! 
    Snips  Weâ€” We have aâ€” a tiny problem. 
    Snails Actually, it's a big one. 
    Trixie What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie? 
     
    Ursa  
    Trixie  
    Snips and Snails  
    Ursa  

    Spike Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick! 
    Twilight Sparkle I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie! 
    Spike No, you don't understand, it'sâ€” 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, is that what I think it is? 
    Spike Majorly. 

    Snips Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa. 
    Snails Yeah, vanquish so we can watch. 
    Snips It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here. 
    Trixie Wait, you brought this here?  Are you out of your little pony minds? 
    Snips But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie. 
    Snails Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major. 
    Ursa  
    Trixie Uh, okay.  Stand back. 
     
    Trixie Heh. Piece of cake. 
     
    Snips Aw, come on, Trixie. 
    Snails Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh? 
    Trixie  
    Snails Well, that was a dud. 
    Snips Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know. 
     
    Trixie Uh-oh. 
    Ursa  
    Snips, Snails, and Trixie  
    Ursa  
     
    Ursa  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on? 
    Snips We brought an ursa to town. 
    Twilight Sparkle You what!?! 
    Snails Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it. 
    Trixie I can't. 
    Snips and Snails What!? 
    Trixie Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better. 
    Snips and Snails Made it up!? 
    Ursa  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Ursa  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     
    Ursa  
    Spike Nice use of number sixteen. 
     
     
     
    Unidentified cow Golly, dont'cha know? 
    Spike That's new. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Ursa  
     
    Rainbow Dash Unbelievable! 
    Spike That was amazing! 
    Applejack Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me. 
    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Rarity Hate you? 
    Rarity Why, whatever do you mean, darling? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought-- 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth. 
    Rarity Most unpleasant. 
    Applejack All hat and no cattle. 
    Twilight Sparkle So, you don't mind my magic tricks? 
    Applejack Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend. 
    Rainbow Dash And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder. 
    Twilight Sparkle You are? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh-huh. 
    Applejack Mm-hmm. 
    Rarity Mm-hmm. 
    Spike Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them. 
    Spike So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself? 
    Twilight Sparkle That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor. 
    Trixie That was just a baby? 
    Twilight Sparkle And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up. 
    Snips and Snails Awww... 
    Spike Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like? 
    Twilight Sparkle You don't wanna know. 
    Trixie Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Why, that little... 
    Twilight Sparkle Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two. 
    Snips Ah . Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor. 
    Snails We just wanted to see some awesome magic. 
    Snips Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome! 
    Snails We deserve whatever punishment you give us. 
    Twilight Sparkle For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five? 
    Spike Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too. 
    Snips and Snails Heah? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think you're right. 
    Snips, Snails, and Spike Sweet! 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends. 
    Spike So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity? 
    Spike Eh, she didn't go for the mustache. 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself. 
    Spike Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, not this again! 
    Spike Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin! 

     
     

Dragonshy

    Fluttershy  
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness. Are you okay? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Because you need some water? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy  Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes. 

     

     
    Fluttershy Help. Help! Please? Help? There's-- there's a horrible cloud of smoke. It's headed this way and-- 
    Rainbow Dash Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven... 
    Pinkie Pie This calls for a celebration! 
    Fluttershy Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for-- 
    Pinkie Pie Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville! 
    Fluttershy There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And-- 
    Pinkie Pie Let's see, that's one, two, three, four... 
    Rainbow Dash Three hundred fifty four... 
    Pinkie Pie Five, six... 
    Rainbow Dash Three hundred fifty five, no, wait... 
    Pinkie Pie Seven. 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over. 
    Fluttershy We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be-- 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up! 
    Fluttershy Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need everypony to-- 
    Twilight Sparkle Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria. 
    Ponies What? Oh no! That's awful! 
    Fluttershy That's what I've been trying to-- 
    Twilight Sparkle But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire. 
    Fluttershy Oh, thank goodness. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's coming from a dragon. 
    Ponies  
    Fluttershy A... d-dragon? 

    Applejack What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sleeping. 
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke. 
    Pinkie Pie He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all. 
    Rarity Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it? 
    Rainbow Dash I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep. 
    Twilight Sparkle All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes? 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity  
    Fluttershy Um, actually... 

    Rainbow Dash Raaah! 
    Applejack Yaaa! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, I mean, grrr! 
    Rarity Ewww! Much better. Onward! 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack Let's go! 
    Fluttershy Um, let's... not?  

    Twilight Sparkle All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall. 
    Fluttershy M-m-mountain? 
    Twilight Sparkle The dragon is in that cave at the very top. 
    Applejack Looks pretty cold up there. 
    Rainbow Dash You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets. 
    Rarity Good thing I brought my scarf. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooo! Pretty! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy. 
    Fluttershy  Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but... 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way. 
    Fluttershy But if I could just have a second... 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that. 
    Fluttershy So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. 
    Fluttershy Oh! Good. I'll stay here and-- 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy. 
    Fluttershy I don't think I-- 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone. 
    Spike You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait! 
    Fluttershy I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... But... But... no! 
    Rainbow Dash Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine. 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle All right girls, move out! 
    Fluttershy But... but...!  

     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Whoa. What was that? 
    Twilight Sparkle That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores. 
    Fluttershy It-- it's so... high! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah! 
    Applejack Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers and all. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, all right. 
    Rarity I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Girls! This is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy? 
    Rainbow Dash Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooo, I think I have one in my bag! 
     
     
    Fluttershy I-it's so... so... steep. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here? 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings! 
    Fluttershy Oh... okay.  
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Augh. 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing? 
    Applejack I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way. 
    Rainbow Dash  Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever. 
    Fluttershy  
     
     
    Applejack Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split. 

    Pinkie Pie Whoo-hoo! I win again! 
    Rarity Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one? 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Told you it was going to take them forever. 

    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Your turn, Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy But... it's so... wide. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now. 
    Applejack You could just leap on over. 
    Fluttershy I-- 
     
    Fluttershy I don't know. 
    Pinkie Pie There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See? 

    

        It's not very far 
        Just move your little rump 
        You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump 

    Twilight Sparkle We don't have time for this. 

    

        A hop, skip and jump, 
        Just move your little rump, 
        A hop, skip and jump, 
        A hop, skip and jump, 
        A hop, skip and jump, 
        A hop skip and jump, 
        A hop skip and jump! 

    Fluttershy O-okay. Here I go. A hop. 
    Applejack That's it. 
    Twilight Sparkle You've got it. 
    Rarity Almost there. 
    Fluttershy Skip. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just don't look down. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 
    Fluttershy I guess I forgot to jump. 

    Twilight Sparkle  Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide. 
    Fluttershy An... an ava... ava... 
    Twilight Sparkle Shhh! 
    Fluttershy AVALA--! 
     
     
    All ponies Avalanche!  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! Help! Ooh! 
     
    Applejack Oh my!  Everypony okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks to you I am. 
    Rarity Eugh. Blech. 
    Pinkie Pie Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again! 
    Rarity Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes. 
    Fluttershy  Sorry. 
    Applejack Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, we'll just have to  climb over. 

     
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity  
    Applejack Wha! Wha... 
    Rarity My apologies. 
    Rainbow Dash Not your fault. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke. 
    Rainbow Dash Mm-hmm. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on!  smoke. Ooh! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy I-- I-- I can't go in the cave. 
    Ponies Ugh.  
    Rainbow Dash Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too. 
    Fluttershy I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of . 
    Applejack What's that, sugarcube? 
    Fluttershy I'm scared of . 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Fluttershy I'm scared of dragons! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals. 
    Fluttershy Yes, because they're not dragons. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing. 
    Fluttershy Yes, because he wasn't a dragon. 
    Pinkie Pie Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him. 
    Fluttershy Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here? 
    Fluttershy I was afraid to. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 
    Applejack All of us are scared of that dragon. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm not! 
    Applejack Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of. 
    Fluttershy I-- I-- I just... can't. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Fluttershy. 

    Twilight Sparkle I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing... right? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Mr. Dragon. 
    Dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle Excuse me. 
    Dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle Mr. Dragon. 
    Dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight-- 
    Dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke.  Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you? 
    Dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle So, you'll find another place to sleep?  

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Dragon  
    All ponies  
    Rainbow Dash So much for  persuading him. 
    Applejack Now what? 
    Rarity  But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years? 
    Dragon  
    Rarity Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone. 
    Dragon  
    Rarity  

    Rarity I was this close to getting that diamond. 
    Twilight Sparkle You mean... getting rid of that dragon? 
    Rarity Oh, yeah... sure. 
     
    Applejack What in tarnation...? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Darling, you look ridiculous. 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing. 
    Rainbow Dash All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, no! 
    Rainbow Dash Get! Out!  
    Dragon  
    Rainbow Dash Heh. Sorry. 
    Dragon  
    Rainbow Dash Who-o-o-o-o-a! 
     
    Ponies Ugh! 
     
     
    Dragon  
    Ponies  
    Dragon  
    Ponies  
    Fluttershy How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully! You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that? 
    Dragon  
    Fluttershy Well? 
    Dragon But that rainbow one kicked me. 
    Fluttershy And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures. 
    Dragon But I-- 
    Fluttershy Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself? 
    Dragon  
    Fluttershy There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all. 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle You did it! I knew you could do it. 

    Spike  I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, take a letter. 
    Spike  With pleasure. 
    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears. 
    Always your faithful student, 
    Twilight Sparkle. 
    Applejack Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record! 
    Rainbow Dash Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Dragon! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration. 
    Fluttershy It's okay, Rainbow Dash. Not everypony can be as brave as me.  
     
     

     
     

Look Before You Sleep

    Applejack  
    Rarity Hmm. Hah! Perfect. 
    Applejack  Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'? 
    Rarity Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack. 
    Applejack Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony. 
    Rarity I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day. 
    Applejack  Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all. 
     
    Rarity Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined! 
    Applejack Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already. 
    Rarity Oh! Ah! Oh! Ph! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me! 
    Applejack Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things. 
    Rarity  Oh, no, no, no! 
    Applejack What now? 
    Rarity I prefer not to get my hooves muddy. 
    Applejack Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so. 
    Rarity  Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose? 
    Applejack Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha. 
    Rarity  That doesn't even make any sense. 
    Applejack Does so. 
    Rarity Does not. 
    Applejack Does so. 
    Rarity Does not. 
    Applejack Does so. 
    Rarity Does not. 
    Applejack Does so infinity. Hah. 
    Rarity Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret? 
    Applejack I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first. 
    Rarity On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first. 
    Applejack I'm not sayin' anythin'. 
    Rarity Nor am I. 
    Applejack Y'all just be on yer way, then. 
    Rarity After you! 
     
     
    Rarity Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter. 
    Applejack Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast. 

     

    Applejack Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta. 
    Rarity Oh! Unacceptable. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity! 
    Applejack and Rarity Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come inside girls, quick. 
    Applejack Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm? 
    Twilight Sparkle It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in! 
    Rarity Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation. 
    Applejack Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality. 
    Rarity Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you? 
    Applejack  If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home. 
    Rarity It may indeed be a problem. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight.  You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those. 
    Rarity Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now.  Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack. 
    Rarity Slumber 101 All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask. 
    Twilight Sparkle My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great! 
    Rarity Yes, uh, great.  

    Applejack  What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces? 
    Rarity Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion. 
    Twilight Sparkle We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book. 
    Applejack Slumber 101 Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night.  Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hurray slumber party! 
    Applejack Blahch. What in the world is this for? 
    Rarity  To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course. 
    Applejack Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'!  
    Twilight Sparkle Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun. 
    Rarity Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you? 
    Applejack Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon? 
    Rarity So do we have an agreement? 
    Applejack You betcha.  
    Rarity Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude. 
    Applejack You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves. 
    Rarity Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be. 
    Applejack Oh yeah? Well, I'm the "get-alongin-est" pony you're ever gonna meet. 
    Rarity That's not even a word. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay! 
    Applejack and Rarity Yay. 

    Rarity So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack? 
    Applejack Just fine, Rarity. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is so awesome!  Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first? 
    Applejack Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one? 
    Rarity Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo! 
    Applejack That's not a real story. You made it up. 
    Rarity It is a ghost story, they're all made up. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one... 

    Twilight Sparkle ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was -- The Headless Horse! 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores? 

    Rarity Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered -- that's critical -- and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da!  
    Twilight Sparkle Ooo! 
    Applejack Nah, ya just eat 'em.  
    Rarity  You could at least say excuse me. 
    Applejack Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon. 
    Twilight Sparkle S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare. 
    Rarity I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change. 
    Applejack Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change. 
    Rarity I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details. 
    Applejack And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do. 
    Applejack I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again. 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle You have to. It's the rule. 
    Applejack Hah! 
    Rarity Fine!  
    Applejack  
    Rarity Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit. 
    Applejack  Happy? 
    Rarity Very.  
    Twilight Sparkle Um, do I ever get a turn? 
    Applejack I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town. 
    Rarity I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town. 
    Applejack I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed. 
    Rarity And I dare you to comb yours just once. 
    Twilight Sparkle I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight? 
    Rarity Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. Oh! It! Is! On!  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch? 
    Applejack I will if she will. 
    Rarity  She started it. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep? 

    Rarity Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed. 
    Applejack My hooves ain't muddy. 
    Rarity They were. There might still be a little on them. 
    Applejack There ain't. See? 
    Rarity Eww! 
    Applejack Now who's bein' inconsiderate? 
    Rarity I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up. 
    Applejack Hey! 
    Rarity Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah. 
    Applejack Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo! 
    Rarity Hey! 
    Applejack Ah. 
    Rarity You did that on purpose. 
    Applejack Um, yeah? 
    Rarity Get up so I can fix it again. 
    Applejack Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.  
    Rarity M-mmm! 
    Applejack I ain't budgin'. 
    Rarity You will if you want any blankets. 
    Applejack Give it back! 
    Rarity I will not! 
    Applejack Yes, you will! 
    Rarity Won't! 
    Applejack Will! 
    Rarity Won't! 
    Applejack Will! 
    Rarity Won't! 
    Applejack Will! 
    Twilight Sparkle Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off! 
    Applejack I've been tryin' my darndest to get along. 
    Rarity No, it is I who have been trying my best. 
    Applejack No, it was me. 
    Rarity No, it was I. 
    Applejack Me! 
    Rarity I! 
    Twilight Sparkle I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry I asked. 

    Applejack, Rarity and Twilight  
    Applejack Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up. 
    Rarity But I-- 
    Applejack Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'. 
    Rarity Wait! Stop! Don't! 
    Applejack No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done. 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Rarity  I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here. 
    Applejack Well, ya shoulda tried harder.  I'm mighty sorry, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah! 
    Applejack What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there? 
    Rarity Cleaning up this mess somepony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you. 
    Applejack We gotta do somethin'! 
    Twilight Sparkle Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches. 
    Applejack  Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, all right? 
    Rarity What was that? 
    Applejack I said I'm sorry! I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please! 
    Rarity Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky. 
    Applejack Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help. 
    Rarity Oh. Let's do this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping? 
    Rarity  
    Applejack  
    Rarity U-ugh. Oh, I look awful. 
    Applejack Better? 
    Rarity Hmph, thanks. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either. 

    Applejack, Rarity and Twilight  
    Applejack Is it bigger than a barn? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Nope. 
    Rarity Is it smaller than a saddle? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No! Only three of your twenty questions left! 
    Applejack  We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'. 
    Rarity Are we getting warmer? 
    Twilight Sparkle Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat. 
    Applejack She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left! 
    Applejack Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes? 
    Rarity Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's it! 
    Applejack and Rarity It is? 
    Twilight Sparkle No.  It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together. 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle See? We could have been having fun like this all along. 
    Applejack If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety. 
    Rarity Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy. 
    Applejack Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie. 
    Rarity Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse. 
    Applejack That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry. 
    Rarity Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are. 
    Applejack Ugh. Are not. 
    Rarity Are too. 
    Applejack Are not! 
    Rarity Are too. 
    Applejack Are not. 
    Rarity Are too. 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle I declare my first slumber party a success! 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Have fun, check. 
    Applejack and Rarity  

    Rarity Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left. 
    Applejack Whu, which is it?  
    Rarity  Sorry. 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all. 

    Twilight Sparkle So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now? 
    Applejack and Rarity  

     
     

Bridle Gossip

    Twilight Sparkle Wow, what a gorgeous day! 
    Spike Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away. 
    Twilight Sparkle I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony? 
    Spike Is it some sort of pony holiday? 
    Twilight Sparkle Not that I know of. 
    Spike Does my breath stink?  
    Twilight Sparkle Not more than usual. 
    Spike Is it... zombies?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... not very likely. 
    Spike Not likely... but possible? 
    Pinkie Pie Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Who?! The zombie pony? 
    Pinkie Pie Z-Zombie pony?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark? 
    Pinkie Pie I'm not alone in the dark. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark? 
    Applejack We're hidin' from her! 
     

     

    Apple Bloom Did you see her Twilight? Did you see... Zecora? 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I saw her glance this way... 
    Pinkie Pie Glance evilly this way. 
    Twilight Sparkle ... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason. 
    Applejack No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes. 
    Apple Bloom  Did not! 
    Applejack So I swept her up and brought her here. 
    Apple Bloom I walked here myself! 
    Applejack For safe keepin'. 
    Apple Bloom Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! 
    Applejack Not from that creepy Zecora. 
    Fluttershy She's mysterious. 
    Rainbow Dash Sinister. 
    Pinkie Pie And spoooooky! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Will you cut that out? 
    Rarity Just look at those stripes! So garish! 
    Twilight Sparkle She's a zebra. 
    Everyone but Twilight A what!? 
    Twilight Sparkle A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with. 
    Rarity  
    Applejack Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a faraway land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live? 
    Applejack That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
    Spike Uh, sorry. 
    Applejack The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow... 
    Fluttershy Animals care for themselves... 
    Rainbow Dash And the clouds move... 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash All on their own! 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her! 
    Rainbow Dash Here we go... 

    

        She's an evil enchantress 
        She does evil dances 
        And if you look deep in her eyes 
        She'll put you in trances 
        Then what will she do? 
        She'll mix up an evil brew 
        Then she'll gobble you up 
        In a big tasty stew 
        Soooo... Watch out! 

    Twilight Sparkle Wow. Catchy. 
    Pinkie Pie It's a work in progress. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do? 
    Rainbow Dash Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oooooh. 
    Rarity Then, she lurks by the stores. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, my. 
    Fluttershy And then, she digs at the ground. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly. 
    Twilight Sparkle And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think? 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk. 
    Apple Bloom  I am a big pony! 
    Rainbow Dash W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird. 
    Fluttershy What if she's digging for innocent creatures? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth. 
    Apple Bloom Well, I'm brave enough; I'm gonna find out myself.  

    Twilight Sparkle You ponies are being ridiculous! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay. 
    Applejack Hey! Where's Apple Bloom? 
    Fluttershy The door's open. 
    Rarity She went outside! 
    Rainbow Dash And Zecora's still out there. 
    Applejack  That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back. 
    Spike Will do! 

    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack You get back here right now! 
    Zecora Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke! 
    Applejack Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh brother. 
    Zecora  Beware! Beware! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware! 
    Applejack And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister? 
    Apple Bloom I...I... 
    Applejack Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you? 
    Pinkie Pie Just like in my song!  
    Twilight Sparkle You guys, there's no such thing as curses! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself. 
    Twilight Sparkle My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale. 
    Applejack Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true. 

     
    Pinkie Pie She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances! 
    Zecora Beware! Beware! 
    Pinkie Pie If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?! 
    Rarity Wicked, wicked zebra! 
    Fluttershy ... it's a curse. 
    Pinkie Pie Then what will she do? 
    Applejack Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true. 
    Pinkie Pie Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out! 
    Zecora  

     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa!  Or she cursed my horn! 

    Twilight Sparkle No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?! 
    Spike A curse! 
    Twilight Sparkle I said a real reason. Something that points to something real. 
    Spike How about this one? 
    Twilight Sparkle "Supernaturals"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey! 
    Spike But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a- 
    Pinkie Pie Ah pfurse! 
    Spike A purse? How could it be a purse? 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie? What happened? 
    Pinkie Pie Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me! 
    Spike Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie! 
    Rainbow Dash  she slapped us all with a-ow- curse! 
    Rarity I'm afraid I have to agree.  
     
    Applejack  I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so! 
     
    Applejack It's a curse, I tells ya! 
    Twilight Sparkle But Fluttershy... seems just fine! 
    Rarity Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will? 
    Applejack Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?! 
    Fluttershy  I don't want to talk about it. 
     
    Spike This is hilarious!  Look at all of you! We got Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that. 
    Twilight Sparkle  This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure! 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash  I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not a curse! 
    Applejack I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not a hex either! 
     

    Apple Bloom This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this. 
    Applejack Now where does she think she's goin' this time? 
    Rainbow Dash I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me? 
    Pinkie Pie Ah am-pft! 
    Rarity And I as well. 
    Fluttershy Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous. 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash How about you, Applejack? Applejack? 
    Pinkie Pie Pf-she's gone-pft! 
    Rarity Aah! Or somepony stepped on her! 
    Twilight Sparkle ... or sat on her? 
    Rainbow Dash Rarity's hair! 
    Rarity Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space? 
    Pinkie Pie Nopthe. 
    Twilight Sparkle Apple Bloom is gone too! 
    Rainbow Dash I bet they went after Zecora. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go. 
    Rarity  Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, a little help here? 
    Fluttershy Oopsie! Sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash  OW! 
    Fluttershy Uh... Spike? Are you coming? 
    Spike Nope! Uh... gotta stay here and look for a cure.  Twilight Flopple! 

    Applejack Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy! 
    Apple Bloom No. 
    Applejack No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister! 
    Apple Bloom Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now. 
    Applejack Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers. 

    Twilight Sparkle C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry! 
    Rarity Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, wait for me!  
    Applejack Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony! 
    Rainbow Dash Ex-CUSE me? 
    Applejack YEEE-HAW! 
    Rainbow Dash What the... 
    Applejack No, Rainbow Dash. Other way! 

    Rarity Oh. I look horrible! 
    Pinkie Pie Plis place plooks horrible! 
    Rarity Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy! 
     
    Zecora  
    Pinkie Pie Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm! 
    Rarity She stole your song? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song. 
    Pinkie Pie Ah. Hmm... Pbth!  
    Fluttershy  

        She's an evil enchantress 
        And she does evil dances 
        And if you look deep in her eyes 
        She will put you in trances 
        Then what would she do? 
        She'll mix up an evil brew 
        Then she'll gobble you up 
        In a big tasty stew 
        Soooo... Watch out. 

    Rarity You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?  Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup? 
    Zecora Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom? 
    Twilight Sparkle Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?! 

    Twilight Sparkle What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?! 
     
    Applejack I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom! 
    Rainbow Dash Aaah! 
    Zecora  
    Applejack Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash. 
    Zecora Oh.  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Zecora  
    Twilight Sparkle What have you done with Apple Bloom? 
    Zecora No! No!  
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Ahh! 
    Zecora Ponies! What is this you... 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Zecora No! You know not what you do! You've gone and spilled my precious brew! 
    Twilight Sparkle We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming! 
    Rarity You made me look ridiculous. 
    Fluttershy You made me sound ridiculous! 
    Pinkie Pie  You made me speak ridiculous! 
    Twilight Sparkle You ruined my horn! 
    Zecora How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work. Then rudely accuse me of being a jerk? 
    Rainbow Dash You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us. 
    Zecora It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode! 
    Twilight Sparkle Where is Apple Bloom!? 
    Apple Bloom Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here? 
    Applejack  Apple Bloom! You're okay! 
    Apple Bloom Why wouldn't I be? 
    Twilight Sparkle Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup! 
    Zecora and Apple Bloom  
    Apple Bloom Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse. 
    Twilight Sparkle Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse. 
    Apple Bloom This isn't a curse. 
    Zecora If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact.  
    Apple Bloom It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke. 
    Zecora That plant is much like poison oak. But its results are like a joke. 
    Applejack What in the hay does that mean? 
    Zecora It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead this plant just wants a laugh. 
    Applejack Will somepony please talk normal? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us. 
    Applejack Little jokes?! Very funny. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron? 
    Fluttershy And the chanting? 
    Rarity And the creepy dÃ©cor? 
    Zecora Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'. 
    Rarity Not welcoming at all, if you ask me. 
    Zecora The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme. 
    Twilight Sparkle But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup? 
    Apple Bloom Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath! 
    Twilight Sparkle But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy? 
    Zecora Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside. 
    Zecora  Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book. 
    Apple Bloom Hahaha. 
    Twilight Sparkle Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath? 
    Zecora Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville. 
    Apple Bloom But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, well... I think we can help you with that. 

    Daisy Look Rose! How awful! 
    Rose The wicked enchantress has cursed them all. 
    Lily Valley The horror, the horror! 
     
    Daisy Run, ponies! Run! 
    Twilight Sparkle Daisy, we need to talk. 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever. 

    Your faithful student, 
    Twilight Sparkle 

    Lotus Blossom Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious! 
    Apple Bloom Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?! 
     
    Applejack  I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more! 
    Rarity Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy  ... Yes. 
     

     
     

Swarm of the Century

    Fluttershy La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la. 
    Parasprite  
    Fluttershy Gah! 
    Parasprite  
    Fluttershy Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before. 
    Parasprite  
    Fluttershy Oh, are you hungry? Here you go.  I guess you were hungry. 
    Parasprite  
    Fluttershy You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself. 
    Spike It also didn't mess itself up. 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow! 
    Spike I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit. 
    Twilight Sparkle There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter. 
    Spike Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw. 
    Twilight Sparkle Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around. 
    Spike You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet. 
    Twilight Sparkle Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming. 
    Spike Or maybe I should...  

     
    Twilight Sparkle What happened to the rest of her name? 
    Golden Harvest We couldn't fit it all in. 
    Twilight Sparkle You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again. 

    Twilight Sparkle That looks perfect. Keep up the good work. 

    Twilight Sparkle Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming? 
    Mrs. Cake Uh...it would be coming a little better if... 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm...  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess. 
    Pinkie Pie I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess. 
    Fluttershy Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting? 
    Pinkie Pie No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home.  What's going on, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay. 
    Parasprite  
    Fluttershy  Three? 
    Twilight Sparkle They're amazing. What are they? 
    Fluttershy I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying. 
    Fluttershy Pinkie, do you want the other one? 
    Pinkie Pie Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding? 
    Fluttershy Ugh? 
    Twilight Sparkle A para-what? 
    Fluttershy How could you not like... 
    Pinkie Pie Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone. 
    Twilight Sparkle A what? 
    Pinkie Pie A trombone, you know  
    Twilight Sparkle Ahhh, typical Pinkie. 
    Parasprite  

    Rarity Stand still, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me. 
    Rarity Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not? 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous. 
    Rarity Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, sooo boooring. 
    Parasprites  
    Rarity Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash What's that sound, Twilight? 
    Parasprite  
    Rainbow Dash Wow, what are they? 
    Twilight Sparkle The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I'll take one. 
    Rarity Me too, oh, they're perfect. 
    Pinkie Pie Does anypony know where I can find an accordion? 
    Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot. 

    Twilight Sparkle  The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow. 
    Spike  
    Parasprite  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh,  what's there to worry about? 

    Parasprites  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Wake up! What happened? 
    Spike Huh? Whaaa! What's going on? 
    Parasprite  
    Twilight Sparkle Where did they come from? 
    Spike I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work! 
    Twilight Sparkle The princess will be here in a few hours. 
    Spike Ugh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, help me round up these little guys. 
    Spike Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around". 

    Parasprite  
    Rainbow Dash Huh? Huh?!  Waaa! 

    Rarity Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful. 
    Parasprite  
    Rarity Oh! Are you okay? Aaah!  Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique! 
    Parasprite  
    Rarity  

    Pinkie Pie Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica.  Isn't that great? 
    Parasprites  
    Pinkie Pie  And not a moment too soon. 
    Rarity Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now. 
    Pinkie Pie And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time. 
    Rarity Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem. 
    Pinkie Pie You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer! 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity  I see we're having the same problem. 
    Rainbow Dash Ditto! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying. 
    Parasprites  
    Twilight Sparkle ...or not. 

    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them? 
    Fluttershy I've tried everything I know I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and... 
    Rainbow Dash Guh. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Princess Celestia  

    Twilight Sparkle If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster. 
    Parasprite  
    Rarity Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster. 
    Applejack Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey! 
    Fluttershy What do we do? 
    Twilight Sparkle  I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest. 
    Applejack  I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away. 
    Rainbow Dash Aye aye. 
    Applejack Yeeeeeee-haw! 
    Parasprite  
    Applejack Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, we don't have much time. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment. 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas. 
    Pinkie Pie  You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie, you are so random. 
    Pinkie Pie And you are all so stubborn! 
    Applejack Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out. 

    Rainbow Dash All right!  
    Fluttershy Ouch. 
    Twilight Sparkle We did it. Nice work, Applejack. 
    Applejack Couldn't a'done it without y'all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives. 

    Twilight Sparkle Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time. 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Where did they come from? 
    Fluttershy Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute. 
    Twilight Sparkle We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now? 
    Rainbow Dash We call in the weather patrol.  
    Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA! 
    Parasprites  
    Twilight Sparkle  Way to go, Rainbow Dash! 
    Applejack Looks like our problems are solved. 
    Pinkie Pie They will be with these cymbals.  Hey! Give me those back! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, what have you done? 
    Pinkie Pie I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville. 
    Pinkie Pie Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette? 
    Applejack Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me! 

    Parasprites  
    Pony  
    Gardening pony Aah! 
    Fluttershy What do we do? They're eating all the food in town. 
    Applejack  My apples! 
    Twilight Sparkle We've gotta do something.  I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food. 
    Pinkie Pie Look, tambourines! If you could all just...  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Parasprite  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Parasprite  
    Rainbow Dash Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore. 
    Rarity Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself! 

    Rarity My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty!  
    Pinkie Pie I'll save you! 
     
    Rarity  

    Applejack No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop. 
     
    Applejack Brace yourself, y'all, here they come.  Didn't see that one comin'. 

    Spike Help! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Help... 

    Zecora Ugh. Have you gone mad? 
    Twilight Sparkle Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please? 
    Zecora Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! Is it? 
    Zecora Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle  Oh no, here she comes. 
     
    Daisy Aaaah, aaaaaaah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them. 
    Rainbow Dash YAAAA! 
    Twilight Sparkle Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense? 

    Twilight Sparkle Look. 
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello, princess. 
    Princess Celestia So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic? 
    Princess Celestia Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable. 
    Rainbow Dash They're not that adorable. 
    Princess Celestia I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit. 
    Twilight Sparkle Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade. 
    Princess Celestia Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation. 
    Twilight Sparkle An... infestation? 
    Princess Celestia Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble. 
    Twilight Sparkle Trouble? What trouble? 
    Princess Celestia Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person? 
    Twilight Sparkle My... report? 
    Princess Celestia Haven't you learned anything about friendship? 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Even when they don't always seem to make sense. 
    Princess Celestia I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you, princess. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, what happened to the princess? 
    Twilight Sparkle Emergency in Fillydelphia. 
    Rainbow Dash Some sort of infestation. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think the princess can handle it. 
    Applejack So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you. 
    Twilight Sparkle We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you. 
    Pinkie Pie Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me. 
    Twilight Sparkle You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville. 

    Twilight Sparkle ...Or not. 
     

     
     

Winter Wrap Up

     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day! 
    Spike Huh? Mommy? 
    Twilight Sparkle Winter Wrap Up! 
    Spike You're not mommy. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready. 
    Spike Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot? 
    Twilight Sparkle No Spike, Ponyville was started by Earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. It's traditional.  
    Spike It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, let's see scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing. 
    Spike I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blanket, which I think I hear calling my name. "Spike! Spike! Come to bed!" Ugh, it's too early. 
    Mayor Mare Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring. 
     
    Mayor Mare Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, this is so exciting. 
    Mayor Mare All right everypony, find your team leader, and let's get galloping! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do? 

    

        Three months of winter coolness 
        And awesome holidays 

    

        We've kept our hoovsies warm at home 
        Time off from work to play 

    

        But the food we've stored is runnin' out 
        And we can't grow in this cold 

    

        And even though I love my boots 
        This fashion's getting old 

    

        The time has come to welcome spring 
        And all things warm and green 
        But it's also time to say goodbye 
        It's winter we must clean 
        How can I help? I'm new, you see 
        What does everypony do? 
        How do I fit in without magic? 
        I haven't got a clue! 

    

        Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 
        Let's finish our holiday cheer 
        Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up! 

    

        'Cause tomorrow springâ€“ 

    

        â€“is here! 

    

        'Cause tomorrow spring is here! 

    

        Bringing home the southern birds 
        A Pegasus' job begins 
        And clearing all the gloomy skies 
        To let the sunshine in 
        We move the clouds 
        And we melt the white snow 

    

        When the sun comes up 
        Its warmth and beauty will glow!

        'Cause tomorrow spring is here 
        'Cause tomorrow spring is here! 

    

        Little critters hibernate 
        Under the snow and ice 

    

        We wake up all their sleepy heads 
        So quietly and nice 

    

        We help them gather up their food 
        Fix their homes below 

    

        We welcome back the southern birds 

    

        So their families can grow!

        No easy task to clear the ground 
        Plant our tiny seeds 
        With proper care and sunshine 
        Everyone it feeds 
        Apples, carrots, celery stalks 
        Colorful flowers too 
        We must work so very hard 

    

        It's just so much to do!

        Now that I know what they all do 
        I have to find my place 
        And help with all of my heart 
        Tough task ahead I face 
        How will I do without my magic 
        Help the Earth pony way 
        I wanna belong so I must 
        Do my best today, 
        Do my best today!

    Twilight Sparkle Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go? 
    Rainbow Dash All right team, you're clear for takeoff. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, hey Twilight, what's up? 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing? 
    Rainbow Dash Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds? 
    Rainbow Dash Um... 
    Twilight Sparkle Right. No wings. 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Great, now what do we do? 
    Spike I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'.  
    Twilight Sparkle Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow. 

    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with. 
    Rarity Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests? 
    Twilight Sparkle Birds' nests? 
    Rarity Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful. 
    Rarity Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest? 
    Twilight Sparkle Would I? Yes! Where do I begin? 
    Rarity Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear. 
    Twilight Sparkle There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my. 
    Spike That nest needs to be condemned. 
    Rarity Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a... 
    Spike An outhouse? 
    Rarity Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this...  
    Twilight Sparkle Hw... 
    Spike I think we lost her. 
    Rarity Ah, and we need to weave the string... 

    Pinkie Pie Hellooooooo, Twilight! Wheeeeeeee! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen. 
    Pinkie Pie Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie. 
    Twilight Sparkle How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville. 
    Pinkie Pie Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out? 
    Twilight Sparkle Would I? 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. 

    Pinkie Pie Yaaaaay!  
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... maybe on second thought. 
    Spike What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful. 
    Pinkie Pie Yippie! 
    Spike Now get out there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, whoa, wow... 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, steer! Steer! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yaaaaa! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh boy... 
     
    Spike Pwuh. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Spike Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight. A natural disaster.  
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Pinkie Pie No. 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie But did I make you feel better? 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess. 
    Pinkie Pie I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her. 
    Pinkie Pie Uh... it's, ah, that a-way. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yaaaaaa! 
    Spike  

    Fluttershy Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming. 
    Hedgehogs  
    Twilight Sparkle Awww, how cute. 
    Fluttershy Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again. 
    Spike Uh, what's "hibernation"? 
    Fluttershy It's like a long sleep. 
    Spike Long sleep? 
    Fluttershy Yes.  Wake up, little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food. 
    Spike I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the "eat less food" part. 
    Porcupines  
    Fluttershy Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'll help, Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy You will? Oh, that would be wonderful. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, let's start there. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming.  I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken. 
    Snakes  
    Twilight Sparkle Waaa! Snakes! Snakes!  Ugh! 
    Fluttershy Good morning, friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle  All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks. 
    Spike  Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter. 
    Spike  Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no, no! I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me.  

    Applejack Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Applejack. How's everything going? 
    Applejack Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'd like to help. 
    Applejack Well, I... I dunno Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just give me a chance. 
    Applejack Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but... 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic. 
    Twilight Sparkle I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes... 
    Applejack Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony. 
    Spike That's my girl, following my advice. 
    Applejack And what in tarnation does that mean? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down! 
    Spike  
    Spike and Applejack Whoa-oa-oa! 
    Applejack What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you? 

    Applejack Nuts, Twilight, you used magic. 
    Spike The nerve. Can you believe her? 
    Applejack That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MAH farm. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, see, I just wanted to...  

    Spike Come on, Twilight. Come on out. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm a winter mess up. 
    Spike Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better. 
    Spike That's what I'm here for, sister. 
    Applejack Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto. 
    Rainbow Dash Got it. 
    Fluttershy Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast. 
    Rainbow Dash Got it. 
    Applejack I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now. 
    Fluttershy No, you simply must wait. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay. 
    Applejack Go. 
    Fluttershy Stop. 
    Applejack Go. 
    Fluttershy Stop. 
    Applejack GO! 
    Fluttershy STOP! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Make up your minds! 
    Mayor Mare Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Did she say late? 
    Mayor Mare I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe. The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt. The nest designer is horrendously behind, we need several hundred, and she's only made one. 
    Rarity  
    Mayor Mare And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... This isn't good, not at all! 
    Applejack And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted. 
    Rainbow Dash Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can. 
    Fluttershy No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly. 
    Big McIntosh Uh, AJ? 
    Applejack Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Rainbowshine  Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west? 
     
    Mayor Mare Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT! 
    Spike Eh, yes, ma'am. 
    Twilight Sparkle Stop, everypony! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Stop! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job. 

     

    Mayor Mare I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time! And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle It was a team effort. 
    Mayor Mare And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title, "All-Team Organizer". 
    Twilight Sparkle Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you, everypony. 
    Mayor Mare And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time. 
     
    Applejack Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike.  

     
     

Call of the Cutie

     
     
    Cheerilee Let's quiet down please. We have a very important lesson to get to.  Thank you. Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks. 
    Diamond Tiara Bo-ring.  
    Cheerilee You can all see my cutie mark, can't you? Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank. 
    Twist Aww...! She's so precious! 
    Cheerilee Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared. 
     
    Cheerilee Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark? 
    Twist Oh! Oh! Oh! When she discovers that certain something that makes her special! 
    Cheerilee That's right, Twist. A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony. Discovering what makes you unique isn't something  or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time. 
    Diamond Tiara Pssst! 
    Apple Bloom What?! 
    Cheerilee Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note? 
    Apple Bloom Uh, I... Um... 
    Cheerilee What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class?  It's blank. 
    Diamond Tiara  
     

     

     
     
    Twist Want some sweets? I've got some peppermint sticks. I made them myself. 
    Apple Bloom Mm-mm. 
    Twist They'll make you smi-i-le. 
    Apple Bloom No... 
    Diamond Tiara I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark. I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already.  I mean, almost all of us have them already. Don't worry, you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-ceaÃ±era this weekend. 
    Silver Spoon It's going to be amazing. 
    Diamond Tiara It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be? 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Bump! Bump! Sugar-lump, rump!  
    Apple Bloom Gimme a break. 
    Silver Spoon See you this weekend... 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Blank flanks!  

    Apple Bloom It's not fair! It's just not fair! 
    Applejack Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Everypony gets one eventually. 
    Apple Bloom But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceaÃ±era without one, I just can't! 
    Applejack 'Course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.  Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh. 
    Apple Bloom I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family. ...runs in the family. Runs in the family! Runs in the family! You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples! Apples apples apples!  Oops... apples. 

    Applejack Get your delicious, nutritious apples here! 
    Apple Bloom Delicious and nutritious, and so many uses!  
     
    Apple Bloom Create fine art for your home with 'em. You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own. 
    Applejack Heh... she's so creative, heh. 
    Apple Bloom You, sir, care t' buy some apples? 
    Dr. Hooves No thanks. 
    Apple Bloom Why not? 
    Dr. Hooves I have plenty at home. 
    Apple Bloom Are you sure? 
    Dr. Hooves Yes, I'm pretty sure I... 
    Apple Bloom You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you? 
    Dr. Hooves Y...ah... If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone? 
    Apple Bloom All right! 
    Applejack You forgot your change! 
    Apple Bloom Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shoppin' bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. You touch it, you buy it! We take cash or credit. 
    Applejack I'm sorry, ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just... 
    Apple Bloom That'll be four bits. 
    Sweetie Drops I didn't put those in my bag. 
    Apple Bloom Likely story. Four bits, lady! 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. And these. And these. 
    Sweetie Drops  
    Applejack Y'all come back now, y'hear? 
    Apple Bloom What? 
    Applejack Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over. 
    Apple Bloom What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark? 
    Applejack Home. Now. 
    Apple Bloom Hm. 
    Applejack Ugh. Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one? 
    Apple Bloom Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet. 
    Applejack Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her? 
    Apple Bloom Mmm-hmm. 
    Applejack Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend. 
    Apple Bloom You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'til the end of th' market? 
    Ace Point Hey! Who's been using my racket? 
    Applejack Yeah. I'm sure. 

     
    Twist Oh, what's up, Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceaÃ±era together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark. 
    Twist Well, um... 
    Apple Bloom  
    Twist Isn't my cutie mark swell? I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent. Pretty sweet, huh? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, pretty... sweet. 
    Twist Hey... this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-ceaÃ±era together. You're still gonna come to the party, are you? 
    Diamond Tiara Of course she will. 
    Silver Spoon It's not like being the only pony there without a cutie mark would be, like, the most embarrassing thing ever.  

    Rainbow Dash Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid? 
    Apple Bloom  There's a cute-ceaÃ±era this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW! 
    Rainbow Dash Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that!  
    Apple Bloom Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen. 
    Rainbow Dash Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen? 
    Apple Bloom But Applejack says th... 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning. 

    Rainbow Dash That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready? 
    Apple Bloom I'm ready! 
    Rainbow Dash I said Are! You! Ready! 
    Apple Bloom I'M READY! 
    Rainbow Dash Juggling, go!  
    Apple Bloom Ah! 
    Rainbow Dash Hang-gliding, go!  
    Apple Bloom Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Karate, go!  
    Apple Bloom Hi-ya! Ee... 
    Rainbow Dash Kite-flying, go!  
    Rainbow Dash Ultrapony Roller Derby, go!  
    Roller ponies  
    Apple Bloom Whoaaa! Whoa... 

    Rainbow Dash Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one... 
    Silver Spoon Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party. 
    Diamond Tiara I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark. 
    Silver Spoon I love being special. 
    Diamond Tiara Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special? 
    Silver Spoon I don't even want to, like, think about it. 
    Rainbow Dash Tried that one... tried that one... 
    Apple Bloom I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at. 
    Pinkie Pie You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes. 
    Apple Bloom Eatin' cupcakes? 
    Rainbow Dash Eating cupcakes? 
    Pinkie Pie Eating cupcaaakes! 
    Apple Bloom I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at the cute-ceaÃ±era! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'. 

    Apple Bloom I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down! 
    Pinkie Pie I don't have any cupcakes. 
    Apple Bloom Oh. 
    Pinkie Pie  But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some. 
    Apple Bloom I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too. 

    

        All you have to do is take a cup of flour! 
        Add it to the mix! 
        Now just take a little something sweet, not sour! 
        A bit of salt, just a pinch! 

        Baking these treats is such a cinch! 
        Add a teaspoon of vanilla! 
        Add a little more, and you count to four, 
        And you never get your fill of... 

        Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty! 
        Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty! 
        Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES! 

    Apple Bloom  Hot, hot, hot! 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, those look much better than the last batch.  Mmm... 
    Apple Bloom Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.  I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever. 
    Pinkie Pie What about that? 
    Apple Bloom What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there?  A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe. 
    Pinkie Pie  Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo. 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa, what's been going on in here? 
    Pinkie Pie We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious. 
    Apple Bloom Twilight, you have to help me! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's the matter? 
    Apple Bloom  Tiara's cute-ceaÃ±era's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, right now! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhhh... I don't follow. How can I help you? 
    Apple Bloom You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself. 
    Apple Bloom Please Twilight, jus' trah. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, but- 
    Apple Bloom Oh please, please, please please please! 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, all right! 
    Apple Bloom Oh thank you thank you thank you.  Yes! I knew you could do... it. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you- 
    Apple Bloom Try again, try again! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Apple Bloom  
    Twilight Sparkle Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time. 
    Apple Bloom It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names. It will be the worst night of my life. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that. 
    Apple Bloom Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that  party. 

     
    Apple Bloom How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner? 
    Pinkie Pie Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson! 
    Apple Bloom I have to get out of here before anypony sees me. 
    Snails  
    Diamond Tiara Hey! It's my cute-ceaÃ±era, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake. 
     
    Apple Bloom Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there. 
    Applejack Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Diamond Tiara Well well well, look who's here. 
    Silver Spoon Nice outfit. 
    Apple Bloom Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute. 
    Diamond Tiara It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one. 
    Apple Bloom Uh, I have a cutie mark. 
    Silver Spoon Eh, what? Since when? 
    Apple Bloom Since... Um... Earlier today. 
    Diamond Tiara Oh really? Let's see it. 
    Apple Bloom I shouldn't. I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-ceaÃ±era. Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be? 
    Diamond Tiara Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway. 
    Apple Bloom Okay, well, I'm gonna go mingle. Enjoy your party.  
     
     
    Apple Bloom Oh no. 
    Silver Spoon Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark. 
    Diamond Tiara Nice try... 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Blank flank! 
    Scootaloo  You got a problem with blank flanks? 
     
    Scootaloo I said, you got a problem with blank flanks? 
    Silver Spoon The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special. 
    Sweetie Belle No, it means she's full of potential. 
    Scootaloo It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are,  like, endless. 
    Sweetie Belle She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday. 
    Scootaloo And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two. 
     
    Diamond Tiara Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side? 
    Scootaloo Because... 
    Apple Bloom  You don't have your cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one. 
    Scootaloo We thought we were the only two. 
    Twilight Sparkle I for one think you are three very lucky fillies. 
    Diamond Tiara Lucky? How can they be lucky? 
    Twilight Sparkle They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be. 
    Applejack And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon. 
     
    "Tornado Bolt" Wow, Apple Bloom, I wish I could be a scientist. 
    "PiÃ±a Colada" Do you really think you could be mayor? 
    "Coronet" Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon. 
    Diamond Tiara Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me. 
    Silver Spoon Whatever. We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar... lump... 
    Diamond Tiara Not now, Silver Spoon. 
    Scootaloo Name's Scootaloo. 
    Sweetie Belle And I'm Sweetie Belle. 
    Apple Bloom Apple Bloom. 

     
    Twist This song is so super! 
    Apple Bloom So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right? 
    Scootaloo How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy-- 
    Sweetie Belle Totally crazy. 
    Apple Bloom Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be? 
    Sweetie Belle Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society. 
    Scootaloo I'm liking this idea. 
    Apple Bloom A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though. 
    Scootaloo The Cutie Mark Three? 
    Sweetie Belle The Cutastically Fantastics? 
    Apple Bloom How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
    Scootaloo It's perfect! 
    Sweetie Belle This is gonna be so great! 
    Apple Bloom We're gonna be unstoppable! 
    Scootaloo What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes? 
    Apple Bloom Not the cupcakes. Trust me. 
    Sweetie Belle Let's see if there are any cookies. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! Come on. 

    Twilight Sparkle Dearest Princess Celestia, 
    I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out... 
    Princess Celestia ...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm... 

     
     

Fall Weather Friends

    Rainbow Dash  Whoo-hoo! 
    Applejack Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl? 
    Applejack I know I can.  Oh, for Pete's sake! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake. 
    Applejack All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it. 
    Applejack  Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm. 
    Rainbow Dash I lost. 
    Applejack Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun. 
    Rainbow Dash I hate losing. 
    Applejack Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh. 
    Rainbow Dash All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville? 
    Applejack Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily. 
    Rainbow Dash ...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it. 
    Applejack Prove what? 
    Rainbow Dash I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all. 
    Applejack You know what, Rainbow? You're on. 

     

    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle So you two are doing what, now? 
    Applejack An Ironâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Iron Pony competition. 
    Applejack See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us isâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash The most athletic pony ever!  
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm here to...? 
    Rainbow Dash  I don't know. Why is she here? 
    Applejack To be our judge and keep score. 
    Rainbow Dash Right, heh. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books.  

    Spike Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, Spike, who are you talking to? 
    Spike Um... Uh, them! Let the games begin! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Ready. Set. Go! 
    Applejack  Dagnabbit. 
    Twilight Sparkle Time, Spike? 
    Spike 17 seconds. 
    Applejack You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo. 
    Spike But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel. 
    Applejack  Nuts and chews! Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ready. Set. Go! 
    Applejack Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow! 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks, but I  couldn't have been as fast as you. 
    Applejack What was the time on that, Spike? 
    Spike 18 seconds! 
    Applejack 18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony? 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I can't believe I won. 
    Applejack Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it. 

     
     
    Applejack Mighty respectable,  
     
    Applejack Years of applebuckin'. 
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 

    Granny Smith Waa-hoo! 
    Apple Bloom Whoo-hoo! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike Why me? 
    Twilight Sparkle Go! 
    Spike Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch. 
    Rainbow Dash Ready for another pony ride? 
    Spike No. 
    Twilight Sparkle Go! 
    Spike Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck. 
     
    Spike And I lose. 

     
    Spike Whoa!  How do I get roped into these things? 
    Rainbow Dash  Does this count? 
     

    Applejack  
     
     

    Rainbow Dash Yuh!  
     
     

    Applejack  Wah! 

     

    Rainbow Dash Yeah. 
     
    Fluttershy  
     

    Spike Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five. 
    Twilight Sparkle Who are you talking to? 
    Spike Them! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle 95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred! 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! 
     
    Applejack Be a good sport, Applejack. 

    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash  
     

     
     
    Applejack  

    Twilight Sparkle All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got. 
    Spike Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one. 
    Applejack  That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Applejack  You're cheatin'! 
    Rainbow Dash I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth. 
    Applejack  
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case.  I am the Iron Pony! 
    Applejack Only 'cause you cheated. 
    Rainbow Dash What? 
    Applejack You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests. 
    Rainbow Dash Sounds like sour apples to me. 
    Applejack Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings? 
    Rainbow Dash Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings. 
    Applejack I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair. 
    Rainbow Dash I still would have won even without my wings. 
    Applejack Hah! Prove it. 
    Rainbow Dash Gladly. How? 
    Applejack Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh! Easy shmeasy. 
    Applejack Hold on! There is one condition the point is to run, so no wings allowed. 
    Rainbow Dash No wings? No problem. 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  

    Spike Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies. 
    Spike Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the-- 
    Pinkie Pie Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken. 
    Pinkie Pie As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes. 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony. 
    Applejack The Iron Phony, you mean. 
    Rainbow Dash So, Applejack, you ready to win second place? 
    Applejack I'm ready to run a good, clean race. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, yeah... 
    Applejack You are not allowed to use your wings. 
    Rainbow Dash I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back. 

    Applejack  Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is. 
    Rainbow Dash Very funny. 
    Applejack 'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Racers! Please take your positions! 
    Spike Um... Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it's me! I'm up!  
    Spike Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering... 
    Pinkie Pie What? 
    Spike Aw... Forget it. 
    Pinkie Pie Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together. 
    Spike We could? 
    Pinkie Pie Climb on up. 
    Applejack Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm racing. 
    Rainbow Dash  Good one, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not joking. 
    Rainbow Dash What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead. 
    Twilight Sparkle I am not an egghead, I am well-read. 
    Rainbow Dash  Egghead. 
    Applejack  But have you ever run a race? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, no, but I do know a lot about running. 
    Rainbow Dash And you know this from... 
    Twilight Sparkle Books. I've read several on the subject. 
    Rainbow Dash What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up?  Get it? Eye muscles. 
    Twilight Sparkle Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself. 
    Applejack Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck.  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow. 
    Pinkie Pie All right, ponies, are you ready? 
    Spike Get set. 
     
    Pinkie Pie And they're off! 
    Pinkie Pie Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to my little ponies. 
    Spike Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall. 
    Pinkie Pie Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it Applejack and Rainbow Dash. 
    Spike You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic. 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge". 
    Spike Yes, it... does. What? 
    Pinkie Pie And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge. 
    Spike So... no fudge? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses! 
    Applejack Not so easy without wings, is it? 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash. 
    Spike Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack! 
    Pinkie Pie What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag. 
    Rainbow Dash You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you? 
    Applejack Whoa! I don't believe it. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, it's beautiful, isn't it? 
    Applejack Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me. 
    Twilight Sparkle She did not. 
    Applejack She did too! 
    Twilight Sparkle She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock. 
    Applejack What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just be careful! 

    Applejack See you at the finish line! 
    Spike I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack. 
    Pinkie Pie She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her. 
    Spike Oookay... Let's get back to the race. 
    Rainbow Dash Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet! 
    Applejack It is for you. Heh. 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident. 
    Rainbow Dash Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was. 
    Twilight Sparkle Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game. 

    Pinkie Pie Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie. 
    Spike And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike? 
    Spike Uh... I... like... pickles? 
    Pinkie Pie Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her. 
    Rainbow Dash Look, ma, no wings. 
    Spike As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Ugh. Hey, Rainbow! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on. 

    Rainbow Dash Nice one, Rainbow. 
    Applejack Later! 
    Rainbow Dash  Aaa! 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead? 
    Rainbow Dash  I'm sure I'll win now. 
    Twilight Sparkle Except that the other racers just passed you. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh horse apples... See ya! 

    Pinkie Pie Applejack, what are you doing up here? 
    Spike There aren't even any trees. 
    Applejack Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift? 

    Rainbow Dash What the hay?! You said no flying! 
    Applejack No, I said no wings. 
    Pinkie Pie I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history! 
    Spike With the most interesting announcing. 
    Pinkie Pie But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running! 
    Rainbow Dash  Aaa! 
    Applejack Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running? 
    Rainbow Dash You know, I think Twilight's right. 
    Applejack You do? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN! 

    Pinkie Pie Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack-- 
    Applejack  
    Spike Oh no, she di'int! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh yes, she di'id! 
    Applejack Cut it out! 
    Rainbow Dash No, you cut it out! 
    Applejack You started it. 
    Rainbow Dash And now I'm gonna finish it. 
    Applejack Oh no, you won't. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh yes, I will.  That's it! All bets are off! 
    Applejack Oh no, you don't. 
    Pinkie Pie It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash-- 
    Rainbow Dash I won! 
    Applejack No, I won! 
    Rainbow Dash I won! 
    Spike You tied! 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash Tied?! 
    Applejack For first? 
    Pinkie Pie For last! 
    Applejack Last?! 
    Rainbow Dash Then who won? 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash You?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before. 
    Applejack What? How's that even possible? 
    Rainbow Dash You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish. 
    Rainbow Dash I don't believe it. Twilight beat us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy. 
    Applejack You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible. 
    Rainbow Dash We weren't very good sports. 
    Princess Celestia Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned. 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash Princess Celestia?! 
    Applejack W-What are you doin' here? 
    Princess Celestia Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves. 
    Applejack I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess. 
    Princess Celestia That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition. 
    Princess Celestia Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered. 
    Applejack Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run? 
    Rainbow Dash I'd love to stretch my legs. 

     
     

Suited For Success

    Rarity Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot! 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you. What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing? Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all. 
    Opalescence  

     

    Applejack Howdy, Rarity! 
    Twilight Sparkle Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate? 
    Applejack What do you think she's makin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like a dress. 
    Applejack Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all. 
    Rarity Is there something I can help you with? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala. 
    Rarity Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine. 
    Rarity Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress. 
    Twilight Sparkle But... 
    Rarity Not another word! I won't take no for an answer. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful. 
    Rarity Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either. 
    Applejack Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds. 
    Rarity You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire. 
    Applejack Hm... Nah. 
    Rarity What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit? 
    Applejack Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... frou-frou-y. 
    Rarity Deal! 
    Rainbow Dash Look out below! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work. 
    Rarity Hmm...  Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Outfit for the what now? 
    Rarity I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show! 
    Twilight Sparkle What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it. 
    Rarity Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I love fun things! 
    Rarity Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us. 
    Applejack So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split? 
    Rarity Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard. 

    

        Thread by thread, stitching it together 
        Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip 
        Making sure the fabric folds nicely 
        It's the perfect color and so hip 
        Always gotta keep in mind my pacing 
        Making sure the clothes' correctly facing 
        I'm stitching Twilight's dress 

        Yard by yard, fussing on the details 
        Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine? 
        Make her something perfect to inspire 
        Even though she hates formal attire 
        Gotta mind those intimate details 
        Even though she's more concerned with sales 
        It's Applejack's new dress 

        Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink 
        Fluttershy something breezy 
        Blend color and form, 
         Do you think it looks cheesy? 

        Something brash, perhaps quite fetching 
        Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die? 
        Making sure it fits forelock and crest 
        Don't forget some magic in the dress 
        Even though it rides high on the flank 
        Rainbow won't look like a tank 
        I'm stitching Rainbow's dress 

        Piece by piece, snip by snip 
        Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip 
        Thread by thread, primmed and pressed 
        Yard by yard, never stressed 
        And that's the art of the dress! 

    Rarity That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now! 
    Main cast sans Rarity  
    Rarity These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out beautiful, don't you think? And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Wow... They're... 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, they're... 
    Applejack They sure are... somethin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes! Something. 
    Pinkie Pie I love something! Something is my favorite! 
    Fluttershy It's... nice. 
    Rarity But what's the matter? Don't you like them? 
    Twilight Sparkle They're very nice... 
    Applejack And we're plumb grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them. 
    Rainbow Dash Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked. 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind. 
     
    Rarity That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them. 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine. 
    Rarity I want them to be better than just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect. 
    Applejack Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose. 
    Rarity Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity. 
    Rarity What have I gotten myself into? 

    Fluttershy Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity? 
    Rarity Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think? 
    Fluttershy I... love it. 
    Rarity Oh, you're just saying that. 
    Fluttershy No, no. I do. It's... nice. 
    Rarity "Nice"? 
    Fluttershy Nice. 
    Rarity If you don't like it, you should just tell me. 
    Fluttershy Oh, but I do like it. 
    Rarity Like it or love it? 
    Fluttershy Um... both? 
    Rarity Which is it? 
    Fluttershy Please stop asking me this, I... 
    Rarity Well, just tell me what you really think. 
    Fluttershy No, that's okay... 
    Rarity Tell me. 
    Fluttershy No... it's fine... 
    Rarity Tell me! 
    Fluttershy I... like it... 
    Rarity Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me! 
    Fluttershy All right! Since you really wanna know...  But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine. 

    Twilight Sparkle Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four. 

    

        Stitch by stitch, stitching it together 
        Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right? 
        Even if my fabric choice was perfect 
        Gotta get them all done by tonight 
        Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive 
        Wait until you see it in the light 
        I'm sewing them together! 

    Pinkie Pie Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops? 
    Rarity Well, I think... 
    Pinkie Pie Balloons? 
    Rarity Well... 
    Pinkie Pie Do it! 

    

        Hour by hour, one more change 
        I'm sewing them together, take great pains 
        Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind 
        Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind? 
        Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time 
        Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine 

        Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call 
        Brings a whole new revision 
        Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision 

    Twilight Sparkle That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor. 
    Fluttershy French haute couture, please. 
    Rarity Ugh... 

    Applejack What if it rains? Galoshes! 

    Pinkie Pie More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers! 
    Rarity Streamers? 
    Pinkie Pie Whose dress is this? 
    Rarity Streamers it is. 

    Rainbow Dash What? 
    Rarity Aren't you going to tell me to change something too? 
    Rainbow Dash No, I just want my dress to be cool. 
    Rarity Do you not like the color? 
    Rainbow Dash The color's fine, just make it look cooler. 
    Rarity Do you not like the shape? 
    Rainbow Dash The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler. 

    

        All we ever want is indecision 

    

        All we really like is what we know 

    

        Gotta balance style with adherence 

    

        Making sure we make a good appearance 

    

        Even if you simply have to fudge it 

    

        Make sure that it stays within our budget 

    

        Got to overcome intimidation 
        Remember, it's all in the presentation! 

        Piece by piece, snip by snip 
        Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip 
        Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed 
        Yard by yard, always stressed 
        And that's the art of the dress! 

    Rarity Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made. 

    Rarity Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my! 
    Fluttershy It's... perfect! 
    Rainbow Dash It's cool! 
    Applejack Why, they're the best duds I ever did see. 
    All It's exactly what I asked for! 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you, Rarity. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh? 
    Rarity Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done. 
    Spike You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity Toity? 
    Twilight Sparkle The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot? 
    Spike Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity! 
    Applejack Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow! 
    Rainbow Dash That's so cool! 
    Pinkie Pie I don't believe it! 
    Rarity Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses? 
    Spike Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true. 

    Rarity Oh.  What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good. 
     
    Spike Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades -- no, centuries -- for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity! 
     
    Applejack Why's everypony lookin' at us like that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh dear. 
    Rainbow Dash You think we overdid it? 
    Applejack Nah.  Okay, maybe a little. 
    Hoity Toity Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink! It's a travesty is what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame. Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time. 
    Rarity  Oh! Hide me. 
    Spike Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! All right, woo-hoo! Go, Rarity! 

    Pinkie Pie Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days. 
    Rarity I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock!  
    Twilight Sparkle You're not a laughing stock, Rarity... 
    Rainbow Dash She kind of is. 
    Twilight Sparkle Shhh! Come on out and talk to us. 
    Rarity  Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now what do we do? 
    Fluttershy Uh... panic? 
    Rainbow Dash That's your answer for everything! 
    Applejack Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this. 
    Pinkie Pie She'll become a crazy cat lady! 
    Twilight Sparkle She only has one cat. 
    Pinkie Pie Give her time. 

    Rarity Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm? 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Huh? Opal? 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming! 
    Rarity Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this? 
    Rarity What is it? It's not... You...  
    Pinkie Pie We all finished your dress for you. 
    Applejack Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing. 
    Fluttershy Do you like it? 
    Rarity Like it? Like it?! 
    Fluttershy Uh-uh. She doesn't like it. 
    Rarity No, I don't like it. 
    All except Rarity Awwww... 
    Rarity I love it! 
    All except Rarity Yay! 
    Rarity You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it. 
    Fluttershy We just followed your brilliant design. 
    Twilight Sparkle Like we should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect. 
    Pinkie Pie We're so super sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out. 
    Rarity Oh, I forgive you. 
    Applejack Well, that's mighty big of you. 
    Rarity But my whole career is still ruined! 
    Applejack Oh, right. That. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe not. 
    Hoity Toity All right, I haven't got all day. 

    Hoity Toity Take two. 
     
    Hoity Toity Hello... Oh, this can't be the same designer. 
     
    Hoity Toity Simply magnificent! And I suddenly have a fierce craving for some Dutch apple pie, candied apples on a stick, apple turnovers, apple cobbler... 
     
    Hoity Toity Brilliant! 
     
     
    Hoity Toity Oh, spectacular! 
     
    Hoity Toity Now this is a fashion show! All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself! 
     
    Hoity Toity Brava! Brava! Magnifico! Encore! 
    Rarity Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much! 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    This week, my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. And I learned this when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.  
    Hoity Toity Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot? 
    Rarity  
    Hoity Toity Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday. 

     
     

Feeling Pinkie Keen

     
    Twilight Sparkle Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Eyes over here, Spike! 
    Spike Uh, sorry. 
    Twilight Sparkle For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the- 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! 
    Spike Nyuh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way! 
    Spike I can't help it. Look! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie. 
    Spike Super-extra Pinkie Pie today. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie? What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means! 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea. 
    Pinkie Pie The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You two better duck for cover. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh! 
     
    Pinkie Pie He just said "nice catch" in Frog. 
     

     

    Fluttershy Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg. 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course you did. 
    Fluttershy  Bye-bye! 
    Pinkie Pie Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too? 
    Pinkie Pie Nah! I could just see it. La-la-la-la-la... 
    Twilight Sparkle C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion. 
    Spike Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it. 
    Pinkie Pie My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa-aaah! 
    Spike Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her? 
    Pinkie Pie It's okay, my tail stopped twitching. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la... 
    Spike Ha ha! That was amazing! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, please. 
    Applejack Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch? 
    Spike Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future. 
    Applejack  Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh! 
    Spike Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too? 
    Applejack I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen. 
    Pinkie Pie My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping! 
    Spike Nyuh! What does that mean?! 
    Pinkie Pie I'll start a bath for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh?  A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle Phhhhft. 
    Pinkie Pie Sooo, basically, it works like this I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is your knee pinchy now? 
    Pinkie Pie No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous! 
    Pinkie Pie No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, okay... I get it. 

    Twilight Sparkle Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. 
    Pinkie Pie What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huge! For one thing,  magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all! 
    Pinkie Pie That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em "combos". 
    Twilight Sparkle Combos? 
    Pinkie Pie Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, sure. 
    Pinkie Pie Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ughhh... You said that combo meant "beautiful rainbow". 
    Pinkie Pie Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't believe this. 
    Pinkie Pie You don't believe because you don't understand. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... 

    Twilight Sparkle Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information. 
    Pinkie Pie Okie-dokie-lokie! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Any twitches yet? 
    Pinkie Pie Nopey-dopey! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now? Anything? 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one? 
    Pinkie Pie I don't control it, they just come and go. 
    Twilight Sparkle That makes no sense! 
    Pinkie Pie Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out. 
    Twilight Sparkle I will not believe in anything I cannot explain. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something... 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my gosh, what? What is it?! 
     
    Pinkie Pie It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat! 
    Twilight Sparkle Urgh... You know what?  Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care! 
    Pinkie Pie Okie-dokie-lokie.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh! 
     
    Spike Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh-huh. 
    Spike Twilight? What are ya doing back there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this? 
    Spike Plan what? 
    Twilight Sparkle Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out. 

     
     

    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Spike Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ah! 
    Spike Whoa-oh-uh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies? 
    Spike Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat. 
    Spike Pinkius-whoicus? Hh! 
    Twilight Sparkle There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move. 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Hm... Itchy nose... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Aha! That makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle This proves... 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle ...perhaps conclusively, thatâ€” 
    Spike Gah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientificâ€” 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ow! Ouch! Ow!  

    Spike What's she doing now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Smelling a flower. 
    Spike Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means? 
    Twilight Sparkle Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch. 
    Spike Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from thatâ€” Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow! 
    Applejack Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi? 

    Spike Here, let me help you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, take this down twitchy tail. 
    Spike Twitchy tail?  Twitchy tail! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember? 
    Spike Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreactâ€” 
     
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh! 

    Pinkie Pie  Hey, Applejack. Whatcha doin'? 
    Applejack Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing. 
    Twilight Sparkle You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me? 
    Pinkie Pie  Silly, that would've spoiled the secret! 
    Twilight Sparkle Urgh! 
    Spike Tail... still twitching? 
    Pinkie Pie All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tellâ€” Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu! 
    Spike Oh no! What does that one mean? 
    Pinkie Pie Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg! 
    Applejack  That's where Fluttershy's headed! 
    Spike Oh no! Is it about her? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, I'm not sure. 
    Applejack We better go and make sure she's okay. 
    Twilight Sparkle Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all. 
    Spike Guhâ€” Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong. 
    Pinkie Pie Okie-dokie! 

     
     

    Pinkie Pie  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu! 
    Twilight Sparkle Cold? Need a jacket or something? 
    Pinkie Pie No thanks, I'm fine.  Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu! 
    Spike So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy? 
    Applejack I hope nothin'. 
    Spike I know, but, whadda'ya think happened? 
    Applejack I'm tryin' not to think about it. 
    Spike Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded? 
    Applejack Just exploded? For no reason? 
    Spike Yeah, like boom! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 
    Spike I know. 
    Pinkie Pie What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!? 
    Spike Can you do that? Can you explode twice? 
    Applejack Of course not. 
    Spike But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and thenâ€” ugh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it. 
    Applejack I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg! 
     

    Applejack Fluttershy? 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy?  
    Spike Fluttershy! You're okay! 
    Fluttershy Of course. 
    Applejack Phew, what a relief. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm so glad everything's all right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a  doozy here is how right I am. 
    Applejack Um... Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but  in anything you can't see for yourself. 
    Spike W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I see it... But I don't believe it! 
     

    Pinkie Pie Is that a hydra!? 
    Applejack Who cares? Run! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! Come on! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooph!  
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm so sorry. 
     
    Fluttershy Ah! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony up that hill! 
    Spike He-e-elp! 
    Twilight Sparkle Coming, Spike! Hang on! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I think we're gonna make it. 
    Spike But Pinkie's still shuddering! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross! 
    Spike Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. 
    Spike How about a squirrel? 
    Twilight Sparkle No! 
    Spike How 'boutâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle No small rodents of any kind! 
    Spike That's too bad. 
    Fluttershy A hop, skip, and a... jump! 
    Spike Whoa-ho! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa! 
    Applejack  
    Twilight He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? Chaaarge! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie T-T-T-twilight! 
     
     
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie T-T-T-twilight! You have to jump! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll never make it! 
    Pinkie Pie You'll be fine! 
    Twilight Sparkle I will not! 
     
    Pinkie Pie It's your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I knew you could do it, Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydraâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie That wasn't it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Spike What wasn't what? 
    Applejack What are you talking about, Pink? 
    Pinkie Pie The hydra wasn't the doozy. 
     
    Pinkie Pie I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? But Iâ€” WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?! 
    Pinkie Pie Dunno, but it just wasn't it. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rrrgh...  Ooh... I give up... 
    Spike Give what up, Twi? 
    Twilight Sparkle The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true. 
    Pinkie Pie Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe? 
    Twilight Sparkle Eeyup, I guess I do. 
    Pinkie Pie Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. Ooh!  That was it. That's the doozy. 
    Spike Bbrrbbrrbbrr. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? What is? 
    Pinkie Pie You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la... 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter. 
    Spike With pleasure, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report thatâ€” Spike, what have I been saying about focus? 
    Spike I know, but I... Well... 
    Twilight Sparkle What's wrong, Spike? Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on? 
    Spike Not really, no. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way. 
    Pinkie Pie Honk! 
    Spike Honk. 
    Twilight Sparkle Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle. 
    Pinkie Pie There it goes again. 
    Twilight Sparkle I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time? 
    Pinkie Pie You never know. 
    Spike  
     
     
    Spike Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole! 

     
     

Sonic Rainboom

    Rainbow Dash Now, what have we learned? 
    Fluttershy Loss of control. 
    Rainbow Dash Good. 
    Fluttershy Screaming and hollering. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, and most importantly? 
    Fluttershy Passion! 
    Rainbow Dash Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one. 
    Fluttershy  Yay. 
    Rainbow Dash ... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder. 
    Fluttershy Yay. 
    Rainbow Dash Louder! 
    Fluttershy Yay. 
    Rainbow Dash Louder! 
    Fluttershy  Yaaay. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh... 
     
    Fluttershy Too loud? 

     

    Fluttershy Yay. 
    Rainbow Dash  And now, phase one of my routine. 
    Fluttershy Wooo. 
    Rainbow Dash Phase two. 
    Fluttershy Way to go. 
    Rainbow Dash Here we go. Phase three. The sonic rainboom. C'mon!  

    Twilight Sparkle  Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a crazy week of studying. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack  
    Fluttershy Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo.  Did my cheering do that? 
    Rainbow Dash Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. That was a truly feeble performance. 
    Fluttershy Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering! 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you two arguing about? 
    Fluttershy Were we arguing? I'm sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash  I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's that? 
    Pinkie Pie It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast!  And some are graceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
    Applejack Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's a sonic rainboom? 
    Pinkie Pie You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once! 
    Applejack And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off! 
    Rainbow Dash It was a long time ago... I was just a filly. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure! 
    Rainbow Dash The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes... It'll be a dream come true! 
    Fluttershy Yay. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. You, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance. 
    Fluttershy She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again. 
    Rarity Go on, go on. 
    Twilight Sparkle Go on what? 
    Rarity Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was? 
    Applejack Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band! 
    Rarity Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on! 
    Twilight Sparkle Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess? 
    Pinkie Pie A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven. 
    Applejack How'd you do that? 
    Pinkie Pie It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase. 
    Twilight Sparkle Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it. 
    Rarity You've got to try! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject? 
    Rarity I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first. 
    Twilight Sparkle Here goes.  
    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle I think it worked! 

    Rainbow Dash You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Well, well, well. What do we have here? 
    Hoops It's our old friend Rainbow Crash! 
    "Dumb-Bell" Get kicked outta any flight schools lately? 
    "Dumb-Bell", Hoops, and "Score"  
    Rainbow Dash I didn't get kicked out. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules, and not enough naptimes for you. 
    Hoops Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom. 
    "Dumb-Bell" That's nothing but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that. 
    Fluttershy Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom! 
    "Dumb-Bell" No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing! 
    Fluttershy Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free. 
    "Dumb-Bell", Hoops, and "Score"  
    Hoops  Yeah, I'll be free. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Oh, don't worry. We'll be there! 
    Hoops See you then, Rainbow Crash! 
    Fluttershy Did you see that? I was so assertive! 
    Rainbow Dash  Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it. 
    Fluttershy But, Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies. 
    Rainbow Dash Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined! 
    Fluttershy Rare... 
    Rainbow Dash Rare?! The sonic rainboom is way more than rare! 
    Fluttershy Rarity? 
    Rainbow Dash Rarity! Are you... flying?! 
    Rarity I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section! 
    Rainbow Dash "We"? I... I can't believe it! 
    Fluttershy It's incredible! 
    Rainbow Dash This is so cool! You guys made it! 
    Pinkie Pie Sure did! 
    Rainbow Dash Wait! How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds. 
    Pinkie Pie Haha. Pretty cool, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds. 
    Applejack And we came to cheer you to victory! 
    Rainbow Dash To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale? 
    Rarity, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie Yes! 

    Rainbow Dash Here it is the greatest city in the sky! 
    Group Oooh! Aaah! 
    Rarity  Oooh! Aaah! 
    Rainbow Dash Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale! 
    Rarity Oh, wait for me! 
     
    Steam Roller Those wings are gorgeous! 
    Rarity Why, thank you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate. 
    Rarity Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention. 
    Applejack Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made. 
    Rainbow Dash Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory! 

     
    Rainbow Dash This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation. 
    Rarity  Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here. 
     
    Rainbow Dash We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought. 

    Rainbow Dash And here's where they make the rainbows! 
    Pinkie Pie  Spicyyyyyy!... 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor. 
    "Dumb-Bell"  Whoa! 
    "Dumb-Bell" Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair! 
    Rarity Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again! 
    Hoops Heheheyeah! Rainbow... Umm... Eyah... Crash! 
    Rainbow Dash Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys? 
    Rarity Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these! 
    "Dumb-Bell", Hoops, and "Score"  
    Rainbow Dash Oohh... 
    Fluttershy Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure! 
    Rainbow Dash Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed! 

     
    Rarity What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off! 
    Rarity Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection? 
     
    Rarity Waa-haa-haa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good. 
    Rainbow Dash  Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition. 
    Rainbowshine Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition! 
    Foggy Fleece Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long! 
    Rarity There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete. 
    Rainbow Dash WHAT?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now... 

     
     
     
    Rarity I'm going to be a while! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    "Dumb-Bell", Hoops, and "Score"  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Madden Fillies and gentlecolts! Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia! 
     
    Madden Please welcome our celebrity judges for the Best Young Flyer Competition the Wonderbolts! 
     
    Madden And now, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer! 
    Lucy Packard Okay, contestant number one, you're up. 
    Rainbow Dash Eyah! 
    Lucy Packard Okay, number two, let's go. 
    Rainbow Dash Umm... 
    Lucy Packard C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got all day! 
    Rainbow Dash She's talking to you! 
    Dr. Hooves Oh. Umm... Oh, I guess that's me! 
    Lucy Packard Okay, number four, time to go. 
    Rarity I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm? 
    Lucy Packard Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on! 
    Meadow Song Let's do this! 
    Rainbow Dash Uhh... What am I gonna do? 

    Twilight Sparkle I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy. 
    Fluttershy My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony. 
    Applejack Hmm... Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over. 
    Lucy Packard Number fifteen, let's go! 
    Rarity Rarity... is ready! 
    Lucy Packard Look, ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together! 
    Rarity Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Madden And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen! Uhh... And apparently contestant number four... 
     
    Rarity Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  C'mon, Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oof. Waaah! 
    Hoops Nice work, Rainbow Crash! 
    "Dumb-Bell", Hoops and "Score"  
    Rainbow Dash Time for phase two. 
    Fluttershy Look! Phase two is working. 
     
    Princess Celestia  
    Rarity And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale!  They'll be talking about it for years! 
    Rainbow Dash Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic  rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity  Look upon me, Equestria, for I... am... Rarity! 
     
    Rarity Uh-oh.  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air! 
    Rarity  
    Misty Fly Ooh! 
    Soarin Aah! 
    Spitfire Uuh! 
    Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming! 
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy Oh, I can't look! 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! Wooo! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa. 
     
    Fluttershy A sonic rainboom! Wooo! Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash I did it. I did it! 
    Rarity  You sure did. Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day ever! 

    Rarity I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head. 
    Fluttershy It's okay. 
    Applejack Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo. 
    Pinkie Pie We still love you. 
    Rarity And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me? 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake. 
    Rainbow Dash  Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! 
    Spitfire So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks. 
    Rainbow Dash Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess. 
    Princess Celestia Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too. 
    Rarity Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria. 
    Princess Celestia I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh! 
    Princess Celestia So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience? 
    Twilight Sparkle I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me. 
    Rarity I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends. 
    Princess Celestia Excellent. Well done, Rarity. 
    Rainbow Dash This really is the best day ever! 
    "Dumb-Bell" Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash. 
    Hoops Dash! 
    "Dumb-Bell" Oh! Uhh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition. 
    Hoops That sonic rainboom was awesome! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, thanks, guys. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before. 
    Rainbow Dash Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it. 
    "Dumb-Bell" Hey. Do you want to hang out with us? Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick! 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry, boys... But I've got plans! 

     
     

Stare Master

    Rarity Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already... 
     
    Rarity Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to... oh, how am I ever gonna get this done? 
    Sweetie Belle Are you sure I can't help? I couldâ€” 
    Rarity No! 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe just aâ€” 
    Rarity No thanks! 
    Sweetie Belle How aboutâ€” 
    Rarity Just stand over there. 
    Sweetie Belle Butâ€” 
    Rarity Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?! 
    Sweetie Belle I got it! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Whoa! 
    Rarity  
     
    Rarity Aah! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way. 
     
    Rarity  

     

    Sweetie Belle Won't you at least let me help you clean up? 
    Rarity No. You've helped me quite enough. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm sorry, sis! I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark. 
    Rarity I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications. 
    Rarity Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions. 
     
    Rarity Oh, what now?! 
    Fluttershy Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken. 
    Rarity  Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming! 
    Fluttershy No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her? 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know? 
    Rarity Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies. 
    Sweetie Belle Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Or not. 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Rarity I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order. 
    Sweetie Belle But you're not eating anything. 
    Rarity No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning. 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you? 
    Fluttershy These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done? 
    Rarity Well, I, uh... 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch. 
    Rarity I'll manage. 
    Fluttershy Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity! 
    Rarity Hello, uh, girls... 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Hey, Sweetie Belle! 
    Sweetie Belle Scootaloo! Apple Bloom! 
    Scootaloo You ready for tonight? 
    Sweetie Belle Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go! 
    Apple Bloom Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent. 
    Scootaloo Even if it takes us all night! 
    Apple Bloom I'm ready! You ready? 
    Scootaloo Very ready! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay! 
    Sweetie Belle And... look what I made us! 
     
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Oh, wow!  That's so cool! Oooh! 
    Fluttershy What does that patch on your cape mean? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay! 
    Scootaloo We're on a crusade, a mission! 
    Apple Bloom To find our cutie marks! 
    Sweetie Belle Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you? 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Oooooh! 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle! What have you done? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled. 
    Sweetie Belle What?! 
    Rarity I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time. 
    Sweetie Belle Butâ€” 
    Rarity No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. It's just the way it has to be. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Awwww... 
    Fluttershy I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night. 
    Rarity I couldn't ask you to do that. 
    Fluttershy Oh, it's no problem at all. 
    Rarity Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be. 
    Fluttershy Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures! 
    Rarity I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do... 
    Fluttershy Come on, it'll be fun. 
    Rarity I assure you, they're quite a handful. 
    Fluttershy These sweet little angels? 
    Rarity Well... all right. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay! 
    Fluttershy So cute. W-wait for me! 
    Rarity Hmmm... 

    Fluttershy Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, andâ€” 
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Twilight Sparkle Hello, Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea. 
    Fluttershy Th-The Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls? 
    Fluttershy Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it? 
    Fluttershy What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all. 

     
     
    Sweetie Belle Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Fluttershy  Okay, girls, uh, what should we do? 
    Scootaloo I'm gonna get my mark first! 
    Fluttershy Girls? 
    Sweetie Belle Nuh-uh! 
    Fluttershy Should weâ€” 
    Apple Bloom I am! 
    Fluttershy Girls, okay, now settleâ€” 
    Scootaloo I'm staying up all night! 
    Apple Bloom Me, too! 
    Sweetie Belle Me, three! 
    Fluttershy I-I know you're excited, butâ€” girls, oh, oh, careful with theâ€” oh, ah, girlsâ€”  So! What do you wanna do? Play a game? 
    Scootaloo We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Apple Bloom And we want to crusade for our cutie marks! 
    Sweetie Belle And, and, and, we, umâ€” yeah! What they said! 
    Fluttershy Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party? 
    Scootaloo Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures. 
    Sweetie Belle But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yay! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers! 
    Scootaloo Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr! 
    Sweetie Belle Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you! 
    Scootaloo You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous! 
    Sweetie Belle You cannot run from me! 
    Scootaloo Raaaar! 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Scootaloo Raaaar!  
    Fluttershy Um, oh, maybe that's not such aâ€” now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Dohâ€” 
    Sweetie Belle Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you! 
    Scootaloo Never! 
    Fluttershy Careful... you don't... 
     
    Fluttershy ...break anything. 
    Sweetie Belle Sorry, Fluttershy. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, sorry. 
    Apple Bloom I guess we aren't creature catchers. 
    Fluttershy Oh, girls, it's okay. Iâ€” 
    Apple Bloom I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters! 
    Fluttershy C-carpenters? 
    Apple Bloom Hammer! 
    Scootaloo Hammer. 
    Sweetie Belle Hammer! 
    Scootaloo Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Um ... that doesn't look like a table. 
    Scootaloo We were making a table? 
    Apple Bloom Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery. 
    Scootaloo We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters. 
    Sweetie Belle Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway? 
    Fluttershy Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game? 
    Apple Bloom A game? 
    Fluttershy It's called "Shhh!" 
    Scootaloo What's that? 
    Fluttershy Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun? I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me!  
    Scootaloo I lose! 
    Sweetie Belle Me too! 
    Apple Bloom Me three! 
    Fluttershy  
    Apple Bloom Okay, now what can we do? Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! 
    Fluttershy No! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Awwww! 
    Fluttershy I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds? 
    Apple Bloom Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do! 
    Scootaloo We've got plans! 
    Sweetie Belle And capes! 
    Fluttershy Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark? 

    Apple Bloom How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep? 
    Fluttershy  Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent. 
    Scootaloo But we're not even tired! 
    Fluttershy How about I sing you a lullaby? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Mm-hmm, yeah! 
    Fluttershy  

    

        Hush now, quiet now 
        It's time to lay your sleepy head 
        Hush now, quiet now 
        It's time to go to bed 

    Sweetie Belle I know this one! 
    Fluttershy Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me? 
    Sweetie Belle  

    

        Hush now! Quiet now! 
        It's time to lay your sleepy head! 
        Said hush now! Quiet now! 
        It's time to go to bed! 

    Fluttershy Okay Sweetie, that was... 

    

        Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! 
        Exciting day behind you! 
        Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! 
        Let the joy of dream land find you! 

    Fluttershy Thank you Sweetie, um... 

    

        Hush now! Quiet now! 
        Lay your sleepy head! 
        Said hush now! Quiet now! 
        It's time to go to bed! 

        Ow! 

     
    Scootaloo What is that? 
     
    Fluttershy  Girls! 
    Apple Bloom Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose! 
    Sweetie Belle I wonder what could have caused that... 
    Scootaloo Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this! 
    Sweetie Belle Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay! 
     
    Fluttershy No, I don't think that's aâ€” ah, come back! Please! 
     
    Fluttershy Come on, girls, the chickens are fineâ€” oh, girls, um... girls! 
     
    Fluttershy Come on, in you go. 
     
    Fluttershy There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Butâ€” 
    Fluttershy Please? 

    Fluttershy So, no more crusading for tonight, all right? 
    Scootaloo Yes, Fluttershy! 
    Sweetie Belle We promise, Fluttershy! 
    Apple Bloom Good night, Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Okay, good night. 
    Sweetie Belle Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next? 
    Apple Bloom There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners. 
    Sweetie Belle N-no, thanks. 
    Apple Bloom Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped! 
    Sweetie Belle Into the forest! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go! 

    Fluttershy  It really wasn't that hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids. 

     
     
    Scootaloo  Wait up! 

    Fluttershy Mmm, peace and quiet.  The Everfree Forest! 

    Fluttershy Those girls have really done it this time! They've really bitten off more than they can chew! Oh, just like me! I never should have offered to watch them.  

    Apple Bloom Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck! 
    Scootaloo What are you doing? 
    Apple Bloom Callin' for the chicken! 
    Scootaloo That is not how you call a chicken. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, and you know how to call a chicken? 
    Scootaloo I know that's not the way. 
    Apple Bloom Then show me. 
    Scootaloo I don't have to show you! 
    Apple Bloom You're just chicken! 
    Scootaloo Am not! 
    Apple Bloom Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo! 
    Scootaloo That's so funny I forgot to laugh. 
    Apple Bloom You also forgot how to call a chicken! 
    Scootaloo Why, you... 
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing. 
    Apple Bloom Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'! 
    Scootaloo Is not! 
    Apple Bloom Is too! 
    Scootaloo Is not! 
    Apple Bloom Is too! Anything yet? 
    Scootaloo Nope. 
    Apple Bloom Darn. 
    Scootaloo and Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk! 

    Fluttershy  Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other. 
     
    Fluttershy Ahh! What was that? 
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy Twilight? I-Is that you? Oh, Twilight, it is you. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they'reâ€”  
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must meanâ€” oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move. I'll be back for you. Girls! 

    Scootaloo Is not! 
    Apple Bloom Is too! 
    Scootaloo Is not! 
    Apple Bloom Is too! 
    Sweetie Belle Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like? 
    Fluttershy Girls? Girls? 
    Sweetie Belle Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy Girls! Thank goodness I found you! 
    Apple Bloom Fluttershy, whatâ€” 
    Fluttershy Girls, we have to leave the forest at once! 
    Sweetie Belle But... we haven't found the chicken yet! 
    Fluttershy There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose! 
    Apple Bloom A cocka-what now? 
    Fluttershy A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on! 
    Scootaloo The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly! 
    Apple Bloom Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was. 
    Fluttershy No! Never look one in the eye! 
     
    Fluttershy If you look a cockatrice in the eyeâ€” 
    Apple Bloom The chicken! 
    Fluttershy Girls! Wait! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! 
    [chicken clucking 
     
    Sweetie Belle There he is! 
    Scootaloo Two chickens? 
    Apple Bloom I thought only one escaped! 
    Sweetie Belle Grab them both! 
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Fluttershy See? Now we have toâ€” 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Fluttershy Girls, please. Girlsâ€” now listen to me, girls, Iâ€” please! 
     
     
    Fluttershy Girls! Behind me, now! 
     
    Fluttershy You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone? 
    Cockatrice  
    Fluttershy You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me? 
    Cockatrice  
    Fluttershy Are you girls all right? I was so worried! 
    Scootaloo Yeah, fine! 
    Sweetie Belle Thanks to that stare of yours. 
    Scootaloo You're like the queen of stares. You're theâ€” 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Stare Master! 
    Sweetie Belle We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on. 
    Scootaloo We promise. 
    Fluttershy Oh, you do, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What... what happened? 
     

    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Fluttershy And that's when it brought you back from stone. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I wouldn't go that far. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm? How so? 
    Fluttershy I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew. 
    Twilight Sparkle You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity. 
    Fluttershy Did you finish all those capes? 
    Rarity  Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again. 
    Fluttershy Won't you stay for some tea? 
    Rarity I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Rarity Girls! Time toâ€” Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time toâ€” Girls! 
    Fluttershy Allow me.  Girls? 
    Apple Bloom Yes, Fluttershy. 
    Scootaloo You called? 
    Fluttershy Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home. 
    Sweetie Belle Of course, Fluttershy, right away! 
    Rarity Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that? 
    Fluttershy I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master! 
    Rarity Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal. 
    Fluttershy Of course. How about later today? 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity How about now?  
    Opalescence  
    Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy  

     
     

The Show Stoppers

    Apple Bloom Where are you takin' us? 
    Applejack We're almost there, young'uns. 
    Sweetie Belle I've never been here before. 
    Scootaloo Ouch! 
    Apple Bloom Oh. Sorry. 
    Scootaloo Are we there yet? 
    Sweetie Belle There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing. 
    Applejack Here we are. 
    Apple Bloom What are we lookin' at? 
    Scootaloo I have no idea. 
    Sweetie Belle What is that thing? 
    Applejack Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse.  Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC. 
    Scootaloo TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause? 
    Apple Bloom Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse? 
    Applejack Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... Waaah!  Uh... house cleanin'? 

     

     
     
    Granny Smith Soup's on! 
    Apple Bloom Whoa! Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter. 
    Scootaloo Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this? 
    Apple Bloom Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted... 
    Scootaloo That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to? 

    

        We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders...  
        ...Never stop the journey...  

    Apple Bloom There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice. 
    Scootaloo What's that sweet tune you're singing? 
    Sweetie Belle Oh. I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Cool! 
    Scootaloo Teach us? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay! 

    

        They all say that you will get your mark 
        When the time is really right 

    

        And you know just what you're supposed to do 

    

         And your talent comes to light! 

    Applejack Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next? 
    Apple Bloom Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse... 
    Scootaloo ...and a map of Ponyville... 
    Sweetie Belle ...and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song... 
    Applejack Theme song? 
    Apple Bloom We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents. 
    Scootaloo A new adventure! 
    Sweetie Belle And earn our cutie marks. 
    Apple Bloom We'll leave no stone unturned! 
    Scootaloo No mountain unclimbed! 
    Sweetie Belle No meal uncooked! 
    Apple Bloom No sock unworn! 
    Applejack Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later! 
    Scootaloo Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Ready! 

     
     

    Sweetie Belle  
     

     
    "Vera"  

     
     
     

     

     
     
     

    Spike I had nothing to do with this. 
    Twilight Sparkle What is going on here? 
    Apple Bloom Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians. 
    Spike Huh. I should think not. What? 
    Twilight Sparkle Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like? 
    Cheerilee And I have the perfect place to start. 
    Apple Bloom "Showcase your talents..." 
    Scootaloo "...for all to see." 
    Sweetie Belle "Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!" 
    Cheerilee There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act... Surely you can find your talent. 
    Apple Bloom This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'! 
    Scootaloo Acting! 
    Sweetie Belle Magic tricks! 
    Apple Bloom Square dancin'! 
    Scootaloo Tightrope walking! 
    Sweetie Belle Tiger taming! 
    Twilight Sparkle My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at. 
    Scootaloo Sure! We can do that. 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! Sure we can. 
    Apple Bloom Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as... 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders ...The Cutie Mark Crusaders! 

    Rarity Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies! 
    Sweetie Belle We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back. 

    Scootaloo Thanks, Mr. Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon. 
    Apple Bloom What do we need this fan for? 
    Sweetie Belle Trust me on this one. 

    Scootaloo Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Anything else? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. 

    Twilight Sparkle "Ghosts, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for? 
    Scootaloo You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you think they're up to? 
    Spike I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out. 

    Apple Bloom I'm glad we're doin' this as a team. 
    Sweetie Belle Me too. Um... so what are we doing again? 
    Scootaloo A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course. 
    Sweetie Belle Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes! 
    Apple Bloom And mind-blowin' dance moves. 
    Scootaloo This is gonna be soo amazing! 
    Apple Bloom Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer. 
    Sweetie Belle What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer. 
    Scootaloo Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery. 
    Apple Bloom And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves. 
    Scootaloo Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad. Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hi-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah! 
    Sweetie Belle Then it's settled! Let's get started. 

    Apple Bloom One... two... three... Oh! Oh! 
    Scootaloo Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing? 
    Apple Bloom Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right. 
    Scootaloo Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all. 
    Apple Bloom Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay! 
    Scootaloo Keep practicing! 
    Apple Bloom Will do. 

     
    Scootaloo We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk? Ugh! I'll never come up with anything! Never, never, never! 
    Sweetie Belle Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going? 
    Scootaloo Pbbbt. 
    Sweetie Belle Pbbbt? Oh my! Sounds serious. 
    Scootaloo I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is, like...  really hard. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, it can't be that bad. "With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia"? Umm... Well... These are... um... good, but... How about after "we fight the fight"...

        There is nothing that we fear 
        We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 
        'Til our cutie marks are here 

    Scootaloo Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah... kind of. 
    Scootaloo Thanks, I'm totally using that. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh no! 

    Sweetie Belle One, two, three, four, five?  
    Apple Bloom Ouch! 
    Sweetie Belle How's the spin coming along? 
    Apple Bloom I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. You know, ponies only have four legs. 
    Sweetie Belle  I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity. 
    Apple Bloom Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, is that what that's for? 
    Apple Bloom Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud. 
    Apple Bloom You're not using power tools, are you? 

    Applejack The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'. 
    Apple Bloom Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo. 
    Scootaloo That's okay. Ugh! 
    Sweetie Belle Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch! 
    Scootaloo Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again! 
    Applejack Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that. 
    Apple Bloom I think that sounded pretty good. 
    Sweetie Belle Me too. You think we're ready? 
    Scootaloo Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing? 
    Applejack Uh... Yeah. 
    Apple Bloom Well? How'd we do? How'd we do? 
    Applejack Uh... 
    Scootaloo Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yay! 
    Applejack "Speechless" is right. 

    Snips ...And on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place. A one, a two, and a three! Hey! Where are they? Snails, where are the... carrots. SNAILS! 
    Cheerilee Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act? Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates! 
    Sweetie Belle Break a leg! 
    Apple Bloom Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say! 
    Sweetie Belle No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say "good luck". So you say "break a leg" instead. 
    Twilight Sparkle My little ponies! How are you doing? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Nervous... 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle. 
    Sweetie Belle Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing? 
    Scootaloo Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh? 
    Apple Bloom And I'm the main dancer. Hi-ya! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh? 
    Sweetie Belle And I'm in charge of... 
    Twilight Sparkle Costumes? 
    Sweetie Belle And sets and props. How'd you know? 
    Twilight Sparkle Really, girls? Are you sure...? 
    Cheerilee Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg. 
    Twilight Sparkle Break a leâ€” 
    Apple Bloom Ugh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... good luck! 

    

        Look, here, are three little ponies, 
        Ready to sing for this crowd, 
        Listen up, 'cause here's our story 
        I'm gonna sing it 

    

        Very loud! 

    

        When you're a younger pony 
        And your flank is very bare 
        Feels like the sun will never come 
        When your cutie mark's not there 

        So the three of us will fight the fight 
        There is nothing that we fear 
        We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 

    

        'Til our cutie marks are here! 

        We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders 
        On a quest to find out who we are 
        And we will never stop the journey 
        Not until we have our cutie marks 

    

        They all say that you'll get your mark 
        When the time is really right 
        And you know just what you're supposed to do 
        And your talent comes to light 

        But it's not as easy as it sounds 
        And that waiting's hard to do 
        So we test our talents everywhere 

    

        Until our face is blue 

        We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders 
        On a quest to find out who we are 
        And we will never stop the journey 
        Not until we have our cutie marks 

        We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders 
        On a quest to find out who we are 
        And we will never stop the journey 
        Not until we have our cutie marks! 

     
     

    Scootaloo Wow. That did not go as well as I expected. 
    Apple Bloom I can't believe they're laughin' at us. 
    Sweetie Belle Was it that bad? 
    Cheerilee Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards. 
    Sweetie Belle Back on stage? No. 
    Apple Bloom They'll just laugh some more. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, what's the point? 
    Cheerilee Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on! 
    Cheerilee Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts. 
     
    Cheerilee Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act. 
    Snips Hey! Mine's at least shinier. 
    Snails Well, mine's bigger. 
    Snips Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, um... heavier? 
    Cheerilee The next award goes to... Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance. 
    Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie  
    Cheerilee And finally, the last award of the night goes to... the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders What? 
    Cheerilee For best comedy act. 
     

    Apple Bloom Can you believe it? We won! 
    Scootaloo I knew our act was awesome. 
    Sweetie Belle You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Twilight Sparkle Congratulations, ponies! Job well done. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  Thanks, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, you don't sound too excited. 
    Scootaloo  We worked really hard and won a prize, but we still don't have our cutie marks. 
    Sweetie Belle Which is the prize we really wanted. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, girls... 
    Apple Bloom But we think we know why. 
    Sweetie Belle Yes. We know why. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess. 
    Sweetie Belle Well, maybe we were trying too hard. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? And? 
    Scootaloo And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us... 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? Yes? 
    Apple Bloom We each should be embracing our true talent! 
    Twilight Sparkle And that is...? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Comedy! 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! You did it! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Did you see our award? Weren't we funny? 
    Twilight Sparkle One day...  One day... 

     
     

A Dog and Pony Show

    Rarity Perfect! 
     
    Rarity Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique.  Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! 
    Sapphire Shores Good afternoon, Miss Rarity! 
    Rarity You yah... Y-y-you know my name? 
    Sapphire Shores Well, of course I do, darling. I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you. 
    Rarity Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores? 
    Sapphire Shores Oh please, call me Sapphire. 
    Rarity  How may I help you, Sapphire? 
    Sapphire Shores Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational! Ow! 
    Rarity I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment. 
    Sapphire Shores  And it is spectacular! I'll take it. 
    Rarity Really? 
    Sapphire Shores Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel. 
    Rarity Beg pardon? 
    Sapphire Shores Costume changes. 
    Rarity  
    Sapphire Shores  Yes, I do have that effect on ponies. 

     

    Spike Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and â€” heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented andâ€” 
    Rarity Spike, a lady is never jealous. 
    Spike Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?! 
    Rarity Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha! 
    Spike Did you find some? 
    Rarity Yes, Spike! Right there! 
    Spike Ooooo! You look so delicious... 
    Rarity Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire. 
    Spike Hm... I will miss you, my sweets. 
    Rarity Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find. 
    Spike At your service, milady. 

    Rarity Spike! 

     

    Spike  
    Rarity You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you get the finest reward. This is from me to you. 
    Rarity Is something wrong, Spike? 
    Spike No. It's perfect. 
    Rarity Ooo, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here. 
    Spike For me. From Rarity. 

    Rover Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss! 
    Fido Where? 
    Rover Preciousss gemsss! He is the gem hunter. With him we can have all those gems... and more! Let's get the dragon. 
    Rarity Spike! Where are you? 
    Rover Wait! Who is that? 
    Rarity You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting. 
    Spike Coming! 
    Rarity I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak.  
    Spike Jackpot! 
    Rover Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony! 
    Diamond Dogs The pony... 
    Rarity Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh.. Oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo... Ewww! Uh... uh... Good day, gentle... uh, fellow. Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike. 
    Spike Ehe... 
    Rarity And you are... 
    Rover A Diamond Dog. 
    Rarity Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um,  you're out hunting for gems as well? 
    Rover Yes. We hunt. 
    Rarity Uh... we? 
    Rover We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt... for you! 
    Rarity  
    Spike  
    Spot Yaaaaah! 
    Fido  
    Spike  Run, Rarity! Run! Aaaah! Uh! 
    Fido Ooooooh! 
    Spot Yaaaaah! 
    Rarity Spike! Come on! Hurry! 
    Rover Gotcha! 
    Rarity Waah! Spike! 
    Spike Got him, Rarity! I got him! 
    Fido Haha! Nope! 
    Spot Sorry, scaly one. 
    Spike Wait! Rarity? 
    Rarity Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you thugs! You brutes! 
    Spike  Rarity! 
    Rarity Spike! Ah, dirt! Aaaaah, Spiiiike! 
    Spike Which, what, where? 
    Rarity Save me...! 
    Spike Nooooooooooo! 

    Twilight Sparkle Spike, can you breathe now? 
    Spike Yes...  I think so. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good. Now tell us what you know. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was... 

    Spike  Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her! 

    Applejack Not a whole lot to go on there, sport. 
    Spike Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up. 
    Twilight Sparkle Creepy guys? 
    Spike They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground. 
    Applejack Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity. 
    All  
    Pinkie Pie Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, girls! Let's get started. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello? 
    Fido  
    Twilight Sparkle  Puh! 
    Rainbow Dash Yuck! Ugh! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Spike Puh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up. 
    Fluttershy Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh! 
    Applejack We can't muscle through it! 
    Rainbow Dash We'll see about that.  
    Applejack Whew. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Rarity... 

    Rarity Oh, woe is me! Whatever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me! 

    Applejack We gotta save her. 
    Fluttershy But they blocked up all the holes. 
    Applejack Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on! 
    Pinkie Pie Ow! 
    Fluttershy Oof! 
    Spike  Whoa! Oof! 
    Rainbow Dash Get 'em! 
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie Whoooaaa! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on! 
    All  
    Fluttershy All those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Ooh. 

    Spot Give me the baubles! 
    Rarity Ah! 
    Fido Give me the beads! 
    Rarity Aah! 
    Rover Where are the trinkets?! 
    Rarity Aaaah! 
    Diamond Dogs Where is the treasure?! 
    Rarity  

    Twilight Sparkle Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do? 
    Spike I got it! I'll save you, my sweet. 
    All Huh? 

    Twilight Sparkle Spike, it is very noble of you... 
    Spike Shhh! 
    Twilight Sparkle  ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you. 
    Spike Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress. 

    Sir Spike I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs! Ah. There you are, you mangy mutts. 
    Rover Who are you calling mutts? Unleash the hounds!  
    Mook dogs  
    Sir Spike Now, where is Lady Rarity? 
    Lady Rarity  Spike! I knew you would save me! 
    Sir Spike Nothing could stop me, milady. 
    Lady Rarity Ohohohoh, Spike. You are my... hero.  
    Sir Spike Mmmmmm... 

    Applejack Hoho there, lover boy. 
    Spike Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite! 
    Applejack Hold on there, little fella. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack! 
    Rainbow Dash Twilight! 
    Fluttershy Oh my goodness, oh my goodness... 
    Pinkie Pie Wait for me! 
    Fluttershy Oh! 
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
    Spike  
    All  
    Spike  
    All  
    Pinkie Pie Whee! Ha, ha, ha! 
    Spike Oh, oh! 
     
    Spike Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity! 
    Twilight Sparkle Um... Which way do we go? 
    Spike Nooooooooooo! 

    Twilight Sparkle All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity? 
    Applejack Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one. 
    Rainbow Dash That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down. 
    Spike I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems. 
    Twilight Sparkle But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems. 
    Spike No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember... 
    Spike That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on. 

    Rarity Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go. 
    Spot No! 
    Fido You're our precious little pony. 
    Rover Forever! Muhahahaha! 
    Rarity But whatever do you want from me? 
    Rover Gemsss! 
    Spot Yes! The gems. The jewels. 
    Fido Find them! Find them all! 
    Rarity Oh! Is that all? 
    Rarity There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit? 
    Rover Good!  Now, dig them up, pony. 
    Rarity What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems. 
    Spot Yes! Find and then dig. 
    Rarity Dig? 
    Fido Yes. Dig. 
    Rarity Ohh...  
    Fido What are you doing? We said dig! 
    Rarity Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.  
    Rover Oh, for goodnessâ€” Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast. 
    Fido She won't dig, she pulls. 
    Rarity I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing? 
    Fido Others will dig. You will haul the wagon. 
    Spot Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved. 
    Rarity Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things! 
    Rover Please be quiet! 
    Rarity Good heavens, what is that smell? 
    Rover Smeeeeeell? 
    Rarity Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath. 
    Rover Enough! Search, pony! 
    Rarity Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated. 
     
    Rarity You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water? 
    Spot Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. Be quiet, pony! 
    Rarity And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity". 
    Rover Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts! 
    Rarity Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?! 
    Spot Aaah! Make it stop! 
    Rover Stop whining! 
    Rarity But I thought you wanted whiiining! 
    Rover Geh! We'll do anything, pony! 
    Rover Oh, uh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity".  
    Rarity  Anything? 

    Rarity  This water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do. 
    Rover  Wait! Why are we doing this? 
    Spot To stop the awful noises from the pony's mouth, remember?  
    Rover Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs? 
    Fido and Spot Mi... dogs? 
    Rover Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises. 
    Rarity What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh!  Not sooo tiiight! 
    Rover Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule! 
    Rarity Did you just call me a... mule? 
    Rover Ehh... 
    Rarity Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly?  
    Spot What are these noises? 
    Rarity He called me ugly! 
    Rover No! Mule! I said mule! 
    Rarity An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow... 
    Fido No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity. 
    Rarity You're just saying that! 
    Spot No, you're still pretty and... and... 
    Rover Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah. 
    Rarity I don't believe you! You never liked me!  
    Rover Oh, I've had just about enough of this! 

    Twilight Sparkle We're getting close. I can feel it. 
    Rarity  
    Spike It's coming from down here. Come on! 
    Rainbow Dash She must be in there. Let's go! 
    Mook dogs More workhorses. 
    Applejack Hoh, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down. 
    Mook dogs  
    Applejack Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies! 
     
    Spike I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away! 
    Twilight Sparkle And just what do you think you're doing? 
    Spike Please, Twilight. Just give me this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Eh... fine.  
     
    Spike Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Excuse me? 
    Spot So picky. 
    Fido And critical. 
    Spot She won't stop talking. 
    Fido And crying. 
    Rover We, uh, give her back. Yes. 
    Spike Rarity! You're safe! 
    Rarity Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me. 
    Applejack Assist you with what? 
    Rarity With those. 
    Spike You're letting her leave with all these... jewels? 
    Rover Yes. Take them. And her with them. 
    Spot Please! 

    Pinkie Pie I can't believe you found all these gems! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs. 
    Rarity Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today. 
    Rarity Me? What did I teach you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all. 
    Spike Hm... "Outshines" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes. 
    Rarity Not if you eat them all, Spike. 
     

     
     

Green Isn't Your Color

    Rarity So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual! 
     
    Rarity But you will not believe what happened to me. 
    Fluttershy Is everything all right? 
    Rarity Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!? 
    Fluttershy Photo Finish? 
     
    Rarity She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous! 
    Fluttershy What a lovely compliment. 
    Rarity She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes! 
    Fluttershy  That's wonderful. 
    Rarity  Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career? 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you. 
    Rarity But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you? 
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness. I don't know. 
    Rarity Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me. 
    Fluttershy I'm flattered, really. 
    Rarity Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise. 
    Fluttershy But... 
    Rarity Nopony! 
    Fluttershy There has to be somepony more quali... 
    Rarity Please! 
    Fluttershy Somepony more into fashion. 
    Rarity Please! 
    Fluttershy Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight. 
    Rarity Please, please, pleeease! 
    Fluttershy Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it. 
    Rarity Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have! 
    Fluttershy  What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. 
    Rarity Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution! 
    Rarity The usual! 

     

    Rarity Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz. 
    Fluttershy A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz. 
    Rarity More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity Oh, this hem is completely off. Pincushion! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, doesn't that hurt? 
    Spike Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone. 
    Twilight Sparkle I promise. 
    Pinkie Pie Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye. 
    Spike I have a crush on Rarity! 
    Pinkie Pie  We won't say a word! 
    Twilight Sparkle Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you... 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle But... 
    Pinkie Pie Forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings. 
     
    Photo Finish I, Photo Finish... have arrived. 
    Rarity Let me just say, what an honor! 
    Photo Finish We begin... now! 
    Rarity Attitude and pizzazz! 
    Photo Finish Yes! Show Photo Finish something. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. Enough! 
    Twilight Sparkle She hardly took any pictures. 
    Fluttershy I'm so sorry. I tried my best. 
    Rarity Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her. 
    Photo Finish It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville. 
    Rarity Really? 
    Photo Finish Yes. Really. And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria. Tomorrow, a photo shoot in ze park.  I go! 
    Rarity Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria". 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything. 
    Rarity Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.  

    Rarity No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria. 
    Rarity Never. 
    Photo Finish Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature! 
    Rarity That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together. 
    Photo Finish Yes... that will not be necessary. 
    Rarity But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures? 
    Photo Finish I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go! 
    Rarity  

    Fluttershy I can't, Rarity. 
    Rarity Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! You must! 
    Photo Finish Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers. 

    Pinkie Pie How'd it go? How'd it go? 
    Rarity It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do? 
    Rarity I just vant to be alone right now. 
    Spike You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone. 

    Photo Finish Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect. 
    Fluttershy Ah... Aaah...  
    Photo Finish Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. Now go! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams? 
    Fluttershy N... nervous. 
    Photo Finish Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you. 
     
    Photo Finish Your cue! Now go! 
    Background voice No seriously... 
     
     
    Fluttershy You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must. 
     
    Lyrica Lilac So graceful. 
    Royal Ribbon So lovely. 
    Hoity Toity So perfect for my new advertisement. 

    Rarity  

    Shoeshine It's Fluttershy! 
     

     
    Rarity Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever. 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes. Best time ever... 
    Photo Finish Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place. 
    Fluttershy I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time? 
    Rarity Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing at the place". 
    Rarity I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go. 
     
    Rarity Welcome to Carousel Boutique! 
    Sweetie Drops Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here. 
    Rarity Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs. 
    Sweetie Drops And you are...? 
    Rarity Rarity, of course. 
    Sweetie Drops Never heard of you. 

    Photo Finish Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her. 
    Fluttershy Photo Finish? 
    Photo Finish She's a natural in front of the camera. 
    Fluttershy Um... Photo Finish? 
    Photo Finish I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics! 
     
    Fluttershy Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late. 
    Photo Finish  How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there. 
    Fluttershy Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend... 
    Photo Finish We go! 

    Rarity My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure she just got tied up. 
    Rarity Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend. 
    Rarity I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease! 
    Twilight Sparkle You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend. 
    Pinkie Pie Forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow! You look great! 
    Rarity Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous. 
    Fluttershy Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated, I could just scream.  
    Twilight Sparkle Feel better? 
    Fluttershy No. Can I tell you something? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course. 
    Fluttershy You promise not to tell Rarity? 
    Twilight Sparkle I swear. 
    Fluttershy Pinkie Pie Swear? 
    Twilight Sparkle Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my  Ooowwwww! 
    Fluttershy I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must!  I must... 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity... 
    Fluttershy Oh, what were you about to say? 
    Pinkie Pie  Forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle Nothing! 

    Twilight Sparkle I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit. 
    Fluttershy Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated. 
    Twilight Sparkle But Rarity told me...  
     
    Pinkie Pie  Mmm... Juicy! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhhhhhh! 
    Fluttershy Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic! 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess you're right.  You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right! 
    Gala Appleby It's Fluttershy! 

    Twilight Sparkle Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone? 
    Twilight Sparkle So you do promise or you don't? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house on top of the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole.  
    Twilight Sparkle Obviously. 

     
    Fluttershy You really think it'll work? 
    Twilight Sparkle They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me. 
     
    Rarity Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about. 
    Fluttershy Oof! 
     
     
    Fluttershy  Ooh... Aah! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity Oh no. 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Golden Harvest Get her off the stage! 
    Lemon Hearts She's an embarrassment to all things fashion! 
    Photo Finish I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake! 
     
    Rarity Bravo! I say bravo! 
    Lyrica Lilac Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display? 
    Rarity Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo! 
    Lyrica Lilac Who is saying these things? 
    Royal Ribbon It's her. The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress. 
    Lyrica Lilac Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo! 
     
    Fluttershy  

    Fluttershy This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something! 
     
    Fluttershy If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh! But Rarity...! 
    Rarity Fluttershy! Are you all right? 
    Fluttershy I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great? 
    Twilight Sparkle Because you ha...! 
    Rarity Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to. 
    Fluttershy You did?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course she did! Because...! 
    Rarity I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much? 
    Twilight Sparkle But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh! 
    Fluttershy Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model. 
    Rarity You do? 
    Fluttershy More than anything. 
    Rarity Then why did you keep doing it? 
    Fluttershy I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria". 
    Rarity And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend. 
    Fluttershy Never! 
    Rarity All this time! 
    Fluttershy If we'd just told each other the truth. 
    Rarity I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again. 
    Fluttershy Me too. 
    Fluttershy and Rarity Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.  
    Photo Finish You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone. 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them. 
    Photo Finish Whaaat? 
    Fluttershy and Rarity We go! 
    Photo Finish Vat has just happened? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike has a crush on Rarity! 
    Pinkie Pie  And you were doing so well. 

    Fluttershy Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. 
    Rarity Isn't it, though? 
    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike? 
    Spike No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry. 
    Spike Apology accepted. 
    Twilight Sparkle Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia? 
    Spike I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     
     

Over a Barrel

    Applejack And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, "Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore." So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... end. 
    Rarity Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree? 
    Applejack Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites. 
    Rarity No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?! 
    Applejack But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa. 
    Rarity Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something. 
    Applejack Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo! 
    Rarity It's widdle Rarity who's all "saddy-waddy"! Urgh! 

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting, I can't even wait! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my goodness... 
    Rarity  For crying out loud in the morning! 
     
    Spike  Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped. 
    Spike Okay, fine... 
    Rainbow Dash Ghk... 
    Spike Good night! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. 
    Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie Awwww! 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash  Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet? 
    Pinkie Pie  No, are you asleep yet? 
    Rainbow Dash  If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash  When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard? 
    Pinkie Pie  What tree? You mean Bloomberg? 
    Rainbow Dash  ...No, Fluttershy. 
    Pinkie Pie  Fluttershy's not a tree, silly! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on? 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree! 
    Rainbow Dash  I do not think she's a tree! I was justâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Did you say she was a tree? 
    Rainbow Dash  No. Well.. Yes. But not exactlyâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Ya know she's not a tree, right? 
    Pinkie Pie She's not a tree, Dashie! 
    Fluttershy I'd like to be a tree... 
    Spike Oh, for Pete's sake! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well that was kind of huffy. 
    Fluttershy Huffy the magic dragon! 
    All except Rarity  
    Rarity Would you all be quiet... now?! 
    All except Rarity Aaaaaah!  

    Spike Bloomberg...? Bloomberg? Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit. Good night.  

     

    Twilight Sparkle A buffalo stampede! 
     
    Rarity I just love their accessories! 
    Twilight Sparkle They're getting awfully close to the train. 
     
    Rarity I want to speak to the manager! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, looky! Now they're doing tricks! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!... Or... Just jump? 
    Rainbow Dash Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act. Hey there! 
    Little Strongheart  
    Rainbow Dash Where ya headed in such a hurry? Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky. No offense. 
    Little Strongheart Huh..? 
    Rainbow Dash I just wanna knowâ€“ Hey! I'm talking to youâ€“ Whoa... Arrgggg... I got you now, youâ€“  
    Little Strongheart  
    Applejack  They've got Bloomberg! 
    Spike Heeeelp! 
    Twilight Sparkle And Spike! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugggh.. 
    Spike  Heeeelp! 
    Rainbow Dash Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow... 

    Braeburn Hey there! Welcome ta A-A-ppleloosa! 
    Applejack Braeburn, listenâ€“ 
    Braeburn Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you! 
    Applejack Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happenedâ€“ 
    Braeburn Terrible is right, your train is a full seven minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages! 
    "Black Stone" Okay, you pull now. 
    Noteworthy Aww, we just switched. 
    Braeburn And those there are horse-drawn, horse-drawn carriages. 
    Applejack ...Listen, Braeburn, Iâ€“ Oof! 
    Braeburn And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block. 
    "Morton Saltworthy" That's enough salt for you! 
    Ol' Salt Can't I at least... get a glass of water? 
    Braeburn Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our mild west dances! 
    Applejack But, Braeburn, weâ€“ 
    Braeburn And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Our apple orchard. 
    Applejack Braeburn! 
    Braeburn First harvest should be any day now. 
    Applejack Braebuâ€“ 
    Braeburn Good thing too! 
    Applejack Braeâ€“ 
    Braeburn 'Cause we need that grub to live on. 
    Applejack Braeburn! 
    Braeburn Uh, yes, cuz? 
    Applejack You have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a hu-uge problem! Some of our friends are missin'! 
    Fluttershy A stampede of buffalo. 
    Rarity They took Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash went after them! 
    Fluttershy And we can't find Pinkie Pie. 
    Applejack And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too! 
    Braeburn Did you say... buffalo?  Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land. They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in. 
    Fluttershy But why? 
    Braeburn Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair... 

    Rainbow Dash Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it. 
    Pinkie Pie Boo! 
    Rainbow Dash Yah! ...Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good. 
    Rainbow Dash Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here! 
    Pinkie Pie I do? 
    Rainbow Dash You're gonna blow my cover. 
    Pinkie Pie I am? 
    Rainbow Dash I'm trying to save Spike! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh my gosh! So am I! 
    Rainbow Dash And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself! 
    Spike Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries, I know those guys. They're cool. 
    Buffalo If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro. 

    Spike Seems they took me by mistake. And they feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest. 
    Rainbow Dash  Ugh... 
    Spike Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we stillâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm!  Before we finish eating? Are you loco in the coco?! Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was? 
    Little Strongheart Certainly. And, Mr. Spike, you like gemstones, yes? 
    Spike Turquoise. Mmm!  Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash You! 
    Little Strongheart You! 
    Rainbow Dash That's it! We are outta here! 
    Little Strongheart Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, right. 
    Little Strongheart We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it! Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds. 
    Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie Huh? 
    Spike I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves. 

    Chief Thunderhooves Hmmh. We have a long and winding stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations.  My father stampeded upon these grounds, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, andâ€“ 
    Little Strongheart I think they get the idea, Chief. 
    Chief Thunderhooves Hmph. It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year. But this year, these... settler ponies, these...  
    Little Strongheart They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission. 
    Pinkie Pie Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash Hmph... 
    Little Strongheart The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair! 
    Spike See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason toâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Huh... Ah! 
     
    Rainbow Dash I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to! 

    Rarity Ow!  Gently, please! 
    Applejack Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em! Let's go! 
    Pinkie Pie Hi, guys! 
    Fluttershy Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle How did you escape from the buffalo? 
    Pinkie Pie We didn't! 
     
    Rainbow Dash We promised the buffalo a chance to talk. 
    Applejack Oh, yeah? 'Bout what? 
    Rainbow Dash We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land. 
    Braeburn That information would be quite helpâ€“ 
    Applejack That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay. 
    Little Strongheart That would be a useful thing toâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all. 
    Braeburn Well... heh... 
    Applejack They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else? 
    Rainbow Dash Plant the trees somewhere else! 
    Applejack Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts! 
    Rainbow Dash The buffalo had it first! 
    Applejack The settler ponies need it to live! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Applejack! 
    Applejack  You're bein' unreasonable! 
    Rainbow Dash  I put my hoof down! 
    Twilight Sparkle Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! I've got an idea! 

     

    

        We may be divided 
        But of you all, I beg 
        To remember we're all hoofed 
        At the end of each leg 

        No matter what the issue 
        Come from wherever you please 
        All this fighting gets you nothing 
        But hoof-and-mouth disease 

        Arguing's not the way 
        Hey, come out and play! 
        It's a shiny, new day 
        So, what do you say? 

        You gotta share 
        You gotta care 
        It's the right thing to do 
        You gotta share 
        You gotta care 
        And there'll always be a way through 

        Both our diets, I should mention 
        Are completely vegetarian 
        We all eat hay and oats 
        Why be at each other's throat? 

        You gotta share 
        You gotta care 
        It's the right thing to do 
        And there'll always be a way 
        Throoooough! 

    Spike  All right, Pinkie Pie! That was fantastic! What a great song! Yeah, right on! 
    Chief Thunderhooves It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to... an agreement. 
    Sheriff Silverstar We have. 
    Chief Thunderhooves That was the worst performance we've ever seen. 
    Sheriff Silverstar Teh... Abso-tively! 
    Chief Thunderhooves The time for action... Hmh... is upon us! Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow. And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten it... and the whole town! 
     
    Little Strongheart But, Chief! 
    Sheriff Silverstar An' we Appleloosans say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'. 
    Braeburn But, Sheriff... 
    Pinkie Pie Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all... 

    Applejack I want my kin ta' have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it. 
    Twilight Sparkle We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt. Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, weâ€“ 
    Rarity About the trees. Now if you couldâ€“ 

    Twilight Sparkle If we could just sit down and talk we couldâ€“ 
    Goldengrape Grrrrr! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?! 

     
    Applejack Sheriff, if we could onlyâ€“ 

     
    Spike Isn't there someway to stop this? 
    Little Strongheart Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so. 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash I know you don't want to do this. 
    Chief Thunderhooves But they have taken our land. What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know... but it's never too late to think of something. 
    Chief Thunderhooves At noon, it will be too late. 

    Rainbow Dash Come on, think! Think, think, think, think, think, think, think! 
     
    Chief Thunderhooves  
    Rainbow Dash  He's not gonna do it! 

    

        â€“what do you say? 
        You gotta share 
        You gotta care 
        It's the right thing to do 

    Chief Thunderhooves Grrr...

        You gotta share 

    Chief Thunderhooves Chaaarge!

        You gotta care 

    Pinkie Pie Wah-ahh! Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa! 

    Sheriff Silverstar Ready... aim... fire! 
     
    Cherry Berry  
     
     
    Sheriff Silverstar Ah! Aah! 
    Chief Thunderhooves  Nooo! 
    Buffalo  
    Spike  
    Chief Thunderhooves Yum! Hey, I've got a much better idea! 

    Applejack  
    Chief Thunderhooves We... will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit, heh... Those... delicious apple pies! 
    Spike I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week.  Auhh...! 
    Applejack Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you! 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care. 

    Pinkie Pie Hey! That's what I said! 

     
     

A Bird in the Hoof

    Fluttershy There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all. 
    Mouse family  
    Fluttershy Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help. 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late? 
     
    Fluttershy  I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go. 
     
    Fluttershy Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it! 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, okay then. See you later. 

     

    Rainbow Dash So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway? Is the pay good? Hellooo? Anybody home?  Too good. I'm bored. 
    Fluttershy Phew. Made it.  
    Guard 1 Halt! 
    Guard 2 Who goes there? 
    Fluttershy  No one. Never mind. I'll go home. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's all right, sirs. She's on the list. 
    Fluttershy Thanks, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you. 
     
    Mr. Cake How's everypony doing? Good? Good. 
    Mrs. Cake Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests. 
    Princess Celestia Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. 
    Fluttershy Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will! 
    Fluttershy Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends. 
    Fluttershy But she's met us all before. 
    Twilight Sparkle And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression. 
    Fluttershy Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right? 
    Rarity Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me! 
    Fluttershy Or... perhaps not that casual. 
    Applejack Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry. 
    Fluttershy It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Mrs. Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Hey! 
    Mr. Cake A thousand pardons, Your Majesty. 
    Princess Celestia That's quite all right, thank you.  
    Mrs. Cake Empty teacup at 4 o'clock! 
    Mr. Cake Uh, I see it, honey bun! 
    Princess Celestia Oh, um... thank you. 
    Mr. Cake Not at all, Your Highness. 
    Princess Celestia  Thank you again. 
    Mrs. Cake Oh, but of course, Your Majesty. 
    Princess Celestia  Gotcha! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh... 
    Princess Celestia And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it? 
    Fluttershy Me? Oh yes, Your Highness. 
    Princess Celestia I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures. 
    Fluttershy Yes, I love to take care of animals. 
    Princess Celestia As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small. 
     
    Princess Celestia Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects. 
    Philomena  
    Princess Celestia Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts. 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy Oh... my. 
    Princess Celestia She is quite a sight, isn't she? 
    Fluttershy I... I... I've never seen anything like it. 
    Philomena  
    Guard  
    Princess Celestia Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better. 
    Applejack Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened. 

    Fluttershy Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly. 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help. Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away. There.  
     
    Fluttershy This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat! 
    Philomena  

    Fluttershy Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up. 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy Doctor Fluttershy expected that. 
     
    Fluttershy Always works.  Uh... Almost always. 
    Philomena  

    Fluttershy There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here comes the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing. 
    Philomena  

    Fluttershy Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy? 
    Hummingway  
    Fluttershy Say hello to your new friend Philomena. 
    Hummingway  
    Fluttershy Aw, look. I think he likes you.  
    Hummingway  
    Fluttershy Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it.  Oh! Um... good try? 

    Fluttershy I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier.  Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better? 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about... 

    Fluttershy Aromatherapy? 
    Philomena  

    Fluttershy Warm bath? 

    Fluttershy Ointment? 

    Fluttershy Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers. 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today...  What is Celestia's pet doing here?! 
    Fluttershy I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no. Nonononononono! This is bad. 
    Fluttershy How could I just walk away and not do anything? 
    Twilight Sparkle But... but... she doesn't belong to you! 
    Fluttershy I had to do something. 
    Twilight Sparkle Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?! 
    Fluttershy But... 
    Philomena  
    Twilight Sparkle I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet! 
    Fluttershy But... 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy  You're right. Okay, let's... 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy ...go. 
    Twilight Sparkle If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing.  

    Guard 1 We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here. 
    Guard 2 We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? You don't say!  
    Philomena  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Philomena  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle It's that dry night air? 
    Fluttershy But it's daytime. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye!  Phew... What are you doing?! 
    Fluttershy Going to return Philomena, remember? 
    Twilight Sparkle We can't now! 
    Fluttershy Why not? 
    Twilight Sparkle You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?! 
    Fluttershy Do you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to! 
    Fluttershy You really think the princess would do that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances? 
    Fluttershy All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well. 
    Philomena  
    Twilight Sparkle That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal? 
    Fluttershy Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. And everything will be fine. 
    Twilight Sparkle Did you give her any kind of medicine? 
    Fluttershy I tried to, but she wouldn't take it. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Then you have to make her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right! 
    Fluttershy She can't fly. 
    Twilight Sparkle No excuses! 
    Twilight Sparkle Done. Okay, what else? 
    Fluttershy Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean. 
    Twilight Sparkle There you go. 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy I don't think she likes it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you? 
    Fluttershy Of course, but... 
    Twilight Sparkle Next! 
    Fluttershy Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put. 
    Twilight Sparkle One step ahead of you. 

    Fluttershy It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's this soup over here? Smells delicious. 
    Fluttershy I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, she'll eat it, all right. 
    Philomena  
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! Where are you going? 
    Fluttershy No! Philomena! Come back! 
     

    Rainbow Dash What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, go! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Excuse me! 
    Pinkie Pie Hi! 
    Twilight Sparkle Beg your pardon! 
    Rarity Put me down! 
    Applejack What in tarnation?! 
    Fluttershy Sorry, but we've gotta find... 
    Guard The princess's pet bird! 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself! 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy I'll catch you! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Fluttershy  
    All except Fluttershy  
    Fluttershy  
    Princess Celestia What is going on here? Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident. 
    Fluttershy It's all my fault. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault. 
    Fluttershy I'm the one who did it. 
    Twilight Sparkle But you were only trying to help. 
    Fluttershy Some help I was. 
    Twilight Sparkle Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me. 
    Fluttershy But it's my fault! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, it's my fault! 
    Pinkie Pie No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about? 
    Fluttershy Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve. 
    Princess Celestia Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony. 
     
    Fluttershy I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena? 
    Princess Celestia This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena? 
    Philomena  
    Fluttershy A... A phoenix? 
    Princess Celestia A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame.  It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady. 
     
    Fluttershy So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to? 
    Princess Celestia Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea? 
    Fluttershy I guess I have some imagination. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you. 
    Princess Celestia And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble. 
    Fluttershy I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves. 
    Twilight Sparkle Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess? 
    Princess Celestia No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember. 
    Fluttershy It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings. 
    Rainbow Dash Hmm...  Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah!  
     

     
     

The Cutie Mark Chronicles

    Sweetie Belle  Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before. 
    Scootaloo Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome! 
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Scootaloo Whoa! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Oh! 
    Apple Bloom Wah! 
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Ow! 
    Apple Bloom See anything? 
    Scootaloo Tree sap and pine needles but no cutie mark. 
    Sweetie Belle Plan B? 
    Scootaloo Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap. 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing. 
    Apple Bloom This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it? 
    Sweetie Belle That's a great safe idea. 
    Scootaloo Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville. 
    Apple Bloom Applejack! 
    Sweetie Belle Rarity! 
    Scootaloo Come on, guys, I said "cool"! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Pinkie Pie? 
    Scootaloo No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale. 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Fluttershy? 
    Scootaloo No! Rainbow Dash! 
    Apple Bloom Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense. 
    Sweetie Belle Of course! 
    Scootaloo Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Sweetie Belle Aah! Uuh! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  

     

     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Applejack Get back here, you thievin' varmints! 
    Apple Bloom Thievin' what now? 
     
    Applejack Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark? 
    Applejack I never told you that story? 
    Scootaloo Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash. 
    Apple Bloom We need all the help we can get. 
    Scootaloo Ugh. Fine. 
    Applejack Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all. 

    Applejack  I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria. 
    Count Caesar Hey! Outta the way, you rube! 
    Applejack  I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan. 
    Young Applejack Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay! 
    Aunt Orange "Y'all".  Isn't she just the living end? 
    Uncle Orange  How quaint. 
    Aunt Orange Don't worry. We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time. 

    Tall Order And how are you finding good old Manehattan? 
    Young Applejack Oh, it's simply divine. 
    Aunt Orange Very well said, my dear. 
    Young Applejack Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you. 
    "Dainty Dove" The... what? 
    Tall Order I say, my dear, what in the world is a "rooster"? 
    Young Applejack  What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool. 
    Pony Dinner is served. 
    Young Applejack Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a... 

    Young Applejack Cock-a-doodle-doo... Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to. I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite... 
    Applejack  I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then. 
     
    Applejack  It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared. 

    Applejack I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since. 
     
    Applejack There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints! 
    Sweetie Belle Aw. That was such a sweet story! 
    Scootaloo Sweet? Try sappy.  Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark. 

     

    Fluttershy All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway? 
    Scootaloo We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark. 
    Fluttershy Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her. 
    Scootaloo Rainbow Dash?! Really?! 
    Fluttershy Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp. 

    Fluttershy  You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer. 
    Young Fluttershy  
    Young "Dumb-Bell"  Nice going, "Klutzershy"! They oughtta ground you permanently. 
    Young Hoops Ha! My baby brother can fly better than you! 
    Fluttershy  It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere... 
    Young Rainbow Dash Leave her alone! 
    Young Hoops Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"? 
    Young Rainbow Dash Keep making fun of her and find out! 
    Young "Dumb-Bell" You think you're such a big shot? Why don't you prove it? 
    Young Rainbow Dash Whaddya have in mind? 

    Young Hoops You're going down! 
    Young Rainbow Dash In history, maybe. See you boys at the finish line! 
    Young Fluttershy  

    Young Fluttershy  Huh? 
    Fluttershy  I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I'd never been near the ground before. 

    

        What is this place 
        Filled with so many wonders? 
        Casting its spell 
        That I am now under 

    Squirrels in the trees

        And the cute little bunnies 
        Birds flying free 
        And bees with their honey 

        Hooooonneeeeeeey! 

    Oooh, what a magical place

        And I owe it all to the Pegasus race 
        If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve  
        I'd have come here sooner, and never leave 

        Yes, I love ev-er-ythiiiiing! 

     
     
    Young Fluttershy Shhh. It's okay. You can come out. Everything's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of. 
    Fluttershy  Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level. 

    Scootaloo Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race? 
    Fluttershy Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened. 
    Scootaloo Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her. Besides, I can't take anymore singing. 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe my sister knows where she is. Bye, Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Bye, girls! 

    Scootaloo How did we get roped into this? Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story. 
    Rarity Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks? 
    Sweetie Belle Of course! Most of the fillies at school already have theirs. 
    Rarity Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine. 

     
    Rarity's teacher Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice. 
    Young Rarity Nice?! They need to be spectacular! And the performance is tomorrow! 

    Rarity  I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night. 
    Young Rarity Maybe I'm not meant to be a fashionista after all... Aah! What's going on?! 

    Rarity  I had no idea where my horn was taking me. But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason. I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark! I knew that this was... My destiny! 
    Young Rarity A rock?! That's my destiny?! What is your problem, horn? I followed you all the way out here for a rock?!  Dumb rock! 
     
    Young Rarity  
     
    Young Rarity Ooh! 

     
     

    Scootaloo Ugh! These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks! They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that. 
    Rarity Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly... 
    Scootaloo Come on, girls! We need action! We need Rainbow Dash! 

    Twilight Sparkle As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun. 

    Twilight Sparkle  And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen. 
     
     

    Twilight Sparkle  I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle  My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam! 
    Crystal Clear Well, Miss Sparkle? 
    Young Twilight Sparkle  

    Crystal Clear Well, Miss Sparkle? 
    Arpeggio  
    Young Twilight Sparkle  
    Top Marks  
    Crystal Clear We don't have all day. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I knew it was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it! 
    Young Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
     
    Young Twilight Sparkle Aah! 
     
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... 
    Princess Celestia You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Princess Celestia But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Huh?! 
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal protÃ©gÃ© here at the school. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Huh?! 
    Princess Celestia Well? 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Yes! 
    Princess Celestia One other thing, Twilight. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle More? My cutie mark! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes... 

    Twilight Sparkle ...yesyesyesyes... 
    Apple Bloom Okay, okay. 
    Sweetie Belle We're happy for you, Twilight. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can. 
    Twilight Sparkle ...yesyes, yeeees! 
    Cherry Fizzy Are you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Um... yes. 

    Scootaloo Ugh! Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?! 
    Pinkie Pie You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark. 
    Pinkie Pie Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine! 
    Scootaloo  Why not? 
    Pinkie Pie All right! 

    Pinkie Pie  There were only rocks. We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden... 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles? 
     
    Igneous Rock Pie We better harvest the rocks from the south field. 
    Cloudy Quartz Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you? 
    Young Pinkie Pie Mom! I need you and dad and the sisters to come in. Quick! 
     
    Young Pinkie Pie Surprise! You like it? It's called... a party! 
     
    Young Pinkie Pie Oh. You don't like it.  You like it! I'm so happy! 

    Pinkie Pie And that's how Equestria was made! 
    Scootaloo Wha... huh? 
    Apple Bloom Look! We're here! 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie. 
    Scootaloo Ugh... 

    Scootaloo Rainbow Dash! You're here! 
    Rainbow Dash I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story. 
    Scootaloo  You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story. 
    Rainbow Dash It all happened during the race at Flight Camp... 

    Rainbow Dash  ...where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor. 
    Young Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  I've never flown like that before! That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt! The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it... a lot! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Ow! 
    Young Hoops Ha! Later, Rainbow Crash! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Hey! 
    Rainbow Dash  Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen! 
     

    Rainbow Dash And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Whooooaaaa... 
    Fluttershy Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark. 
    Pinkie Pie I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile. 
    Applejack When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom! 
    Rarity There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
    Pinkie Pie We all owe our cutie marks to you! 
    Fluttershy Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met. 
    Rarity We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it! 
    Applejack Come here, y'all. 
    Mane Six AWWW!!! 
    Fluttershy I'm so glad we're friends! 
    Pinkie Pie I love you, guys! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Awwww... 
    Scootaloo Ewwww... Gimme a break. Come on, Crusaders! Maybe we just need to try zip lining again.  
    Fluttershy Hey. How about a song? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Definitely! 
    Scootaloo Nooooo! 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow. 
    Spike Gross! When did you get so cheesy? 
    Twilight Sparkle Just write it, Spike. 

     
     

Owl's Well That Ends Well

    Twilight Sparkle This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing! 
    Spike Awesome! 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years. 
    Spike A centennial celebration! 
    Twilight Sparkle We better get a move on! 
    Spike Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa!  There. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, did you grab my quill and ink? 
    Spike Check! 
    Twilight Sparkle Scrolls? 
    Spike Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies! 
    Twilight Sparkle  I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant. 
    Spike I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. 
    Twilight Sparkle That is why you are my number one assistant. 
    Spike Missed that! Huh...? 
    Twilight Sparkle I said...  Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy". 
    Spike The Astronomo-lomo homono what? 
    Twilight Sparkle You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...? 
    Spike Right. Check! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh... Ahhhh...!  
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long? 
     

     

    Twilight Sparkle I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight. 
    Spike Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome! 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer. 
    Spike Yeah, I'm a sweet talker. 
    Twilight Sparkle And a number one assistant, right? 
    Spike Check! 
    Rainbow Dash  Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them. 
    Scootaloo Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash? 
    Scootaloo Yes ma'am! 
    Rarity Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing? 
    Spike Oh, come on.  I said come on. 
    Pinkie Pie Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy? 
    Rarity Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you. 
    Spike Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it.  Twilight, your turn. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, that's enough. 
    Spike Oh, right. That's enough. 
    Sweetie Belle Hey, everypony! The show is starting! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike Wow... 
    Spike  Huh? 

    Pinkie Pie Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike? 
    Spike  
    Rarity Oh, poor little thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Aww... He's worked himself to the bone. 
    Pinkie Pie And now the punch has been... "spiked"! 
     

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Goodnight, Spike.  Sweet dreams, number one assistant. 
    Twilight Sparkle  "The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and frozen gases. They..." 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..." 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake... 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll. 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! Hoo! Hoo-hoo. 
    Twilight Sparkle Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! Hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..." 

    Spike  Huh? Waah! I overslept! I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast! Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight! And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, don't worry. 
    Spike But my morning chores... 
    Twilight Sparkle It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you. 
    Spike Who? 
    Twilight Sparkle He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time. 
    Spike Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I... 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library. 
    Spike Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? 
    Spike Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me. 
    Owlowiscious Hoo. 
    Spike Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo? 
    Spike I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! 
    Spike Who? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! 
    Spike I thought your name was Owlowiscious! 
    Owlowiscious Hoo? 
    Spike Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo? 
    Spike So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know?  Well, not really, but... You know what I mean! 
     
    Spike That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do! 

    Pinkie Pie Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... Hooked! 
     
    Fluttershy He's just wonderful. 
    Spike  "He's just wonderful." Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer. 
    Rarity And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you. 
    Spike Grrr! 
    Applejack What's he all saddle sore about? 
    Rainbow Dash He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious. 
    Fluttershy Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him? 
    Twilight Sparkle Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced. 

    Spike They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Mythâ€” 
    Spike ...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland" too. 
    Spike Hey! Whoa! Whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Climb down from there before you fall. 
     
    Spike Grrr! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Shoot! 
    Spike Yes, sir! 
    Twilight Sparkle My last writing quill. It's broken. 
    Spike Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is here!  Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo. 
    Spike Where am I gonna get a quill? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, wait! Wait! 

    Spike But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things! 
    Davenport Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa? 
    Spike  

    Pinkie Pie I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince! 
    Spike Not a quince. A quill! 
    Pinkie Pie Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche!  
    Spike Not a quiche.  A quill! 
    Pinkie Pie Nope. Sorry. All outta quills. 
    Spike  Shoot. 

    Spike Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here!  Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it! 

    Spike  Spike... to the rescue. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill. 
    Spike That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them. 
    Spike Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finishâ€“  
    Twilight Sparkle Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy. 

    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way? 
    Spike Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike. 
    Spike  You set me up! Well, two can play that game. 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! 
    Spike Not "who"! Two! Urgh! 

    Spike Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how? 
     
    Spike Ah... Muahahaha! 

    Rarity Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party. 
    Spike So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha! 

    Spike  
    Spike That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is not the Spike I know and love. 
    Spike She... She doesn't love me anymore. 

    Spike Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse? 
     
     
    Spike I guess that's a yes. 
    Spike Hello? Hello? 
     
    Spike What is that? 
    Spike If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo! 

    Spike  Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here. 
    Green dragon What are you doing in my cave? And why are you eating my gems? 
    Spike Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right? 
    Green dragon  
    Spike Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right? 
    Green dragon  
    Spike You don't scare me! So you're big. 
    Green dragon  
    Spike Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah! 
    Owlowiscious Hoo-hoo! 
    Green dragon  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Over here! 
    Spike Am I glad to see you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see! 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! Hoo-hoo! 
    Green dragon  
    Spike  

    Twilight Sparkle  Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away? 
    Spike I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull. 
    Spike I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous. 
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive. 
    Spike And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me? 
    Owlowiscious Hoo? 
    Spike Me. Forgive me, Spike. 
    Owlowiscious Hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle  He forgives you, Spike. 
    Spike Hey! How did you guys know where I was? 
    Twilight Sparkle It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave. 
    Spike Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it? Uh...  

    Twilight Sparkle I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today... 
    Spike I'm ready when you are. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned? 
    Spike Really? Why, that's a big responsibility! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle. 
    Spike Dear Princess Celestia, 
    This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will...  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike. 
    Owlowiscious Hoo? 
    Twilight Sparkle Who? Spike! You kno... Ohhhh...  

     
     

Party of One

     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie... 

    

        This is your singing telegram 
        I hope it finds you well 
        You're invited to a party 
        'Cause we think you're really swell 

        Gummy's turning one year old 
        So help us celebrate 
        The cake will be delicious 
        The festivities first-rate 

        There will be games and dancing 
        Bob for apples, cut a rug  
        And when the party's over 
        We'll gather 'round for a group hug 

         
        No need to bring a gift 
        Being there will be enough 
        Birthdays mean having fun with friends 
        Not getting lots of stuff 

         
        It won't be the same without you 
        So we hope that you say yes 
        So, please, oh please R.S.V.P. 
        And come, and be our guest! 

    Pinkie Pie  Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations. 

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Nice one! Now, let me show you how it's really done. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, girls! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Pinkie Pie! 
    Applejack Howdy! 
    Pinkie Pie  Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party. 
    Applejack Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
    Rainbow Dash Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da! 
    Pinkie Pie Aw! It's just a boring old apple. Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there. 
    Rainbow Dash  What kind of surprises? 
    Pinkie Pie I can't tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn't be a surprise. 
    Applejack  

    Rarity This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your "Spring Has Sprung" party? 
    Pinkie Pie Nope! Something new. 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie It's Gummy's favorite. 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, this is my jam! 
    Rarity  

    Pinkie Pie Having fun? 
    Twilight Sparkle A blast! 
    Fluttershy You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yah! 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie C'mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! 

    Applejack Hoo-wee! I am beat! I haven't danced that much since... Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite! 
    Rainbow Dash See ya later, birthday alligator! 
    Rarity Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree. 
    Fluttershy It's been lovely. 
    Pinkie Pie You sure you don't wanna stay? There's still some cake left. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I think I'm gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon. 
    Pinkie Pie  We should do this again soon! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh! Hi, Pinki- 
    Pinkie Pie It's soon! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pardon me? 
    Pinkie Pie You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon! Here's your invitation! 
    Twilight Sparkle "You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party. This afternoon at 3 o'clock." 
    Pinkie Pie All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch! 
    Twilight Sparkle This afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, indeedy! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies. I've really gotta hit the books. 
    Pinkie Pie I understand. Your studies come first. But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake. 
    Twilight Sparkle Please do. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books. You should really just read them. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll keep that in mind. 

    Applejack Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you 'round these parts? 
    Pinkie Pie Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It's an invitation to Gummy's "after-birthday" party this afternoon. There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch! 
    Applejack This afternoon? A-as in, "this afternoon" this afternoon? 
    Pinkie Pie That's funny. That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, "Yes! It's this afternoon!" 
    Applejack Uh, well, I... I... uh... I don't think I can make it 'cause... uh... I have to... uh... uh, you know what? I... uh... pick apples! Yep, apples! 'Cause that's what we do! With the... apples. We, uh... pick 'em! 
     
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie Okey-dokey-lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests. 
    Applejack  

    Spike  Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one? 
    Rarity  Hmm... perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration. 
    Spike  
    Rarity Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What's the occasion? 
    Pinkie Pie Gummy's "after-birthday" party is this afternoon. I'm delivering the invitations. 
    Rarity The party is this afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon? 
    Pinkie Pie It's so strange. Everypony keeps saying that. 
    Rarity Oh... do they? 
    Pinkie Pie I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party. 
    Rarity And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline. I have to... wash my hair! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty. 
    Rarity It doesn't? 
    Pinkie Pie Nope! 
    Rarity See?  Dirty! I have to go! 
    Pinkie Pie Huh... No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests. 

    Rainbow Dash This afternoon? 
    Fluttershy As in...? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, man! We'd love to, but... we're... house-sitting this afternoon. 
    Pinkie Pie  Both of you? 
    Fluttershy It's... uh... a big house. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, look at the time! We'd really better get going. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who're you house-sitting for? 
    Rainbow Dash Harry. 
    Pinkie Pie Harry? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I don't think you know him. 
    Pinkie Pie That's strange. I know just about everypony around here. 
    Fluttershy He's... a bear. 
    Pinkie Pie A bear? 
    Rainbow Dash Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house? 
    Fluttershy It's, uh, really more of a cave. 
    Rainbow Dash But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house. 
    Fluttershy And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh... 
    Rainbow Dash A-at the beach! 
    Pinkie Pie He's vacationing at the beach? 
    Rainbow Dash Yup! He loves to... 

    Fluttershy 
    Collect sea shells! 
    ...Play beach volleyball! 
    ...Collect volleyballs! 

    

    Rainbow Dash 
    Play beach volleyball! 
    ...Collect sea shells! 
    ...Play sea shells! 

    Rainbow Dash Gotta go! 

    Pinkie Pie Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like...  excuses! 
     
    Pinkie Pie That doesn't look like studying... or hitting! 

     
    Mrs. Cake Ooh! You must be here for... 
    Twilight Sparkle Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around? 
    Mrs. Cake Oh, I don't think so. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good. I don't wanna her to know anything about this. 
    Mrs. Cake Yes, of course. I'll be right back. 
    Pinkie Pie But... we're friends. What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about?  She's coming back. 
    Mrs. Cake There you go. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, and remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie. Hey! What's with the tin can?  

    Pinkie Pie Time to get to the bottom of things!  I think our cover's been blown! We'll need a new disguise. 
     
    Rarity She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think so. 
    Rarity Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything. 
    Twilight Sparkle Me too. 
    Gummy  
    Rarity Have you seen her? 
    Fluttershy Not since this morning. 
    Rarity Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today? 
    Fluttershy I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there. 
    Rarity Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better. 
    Fluttershy As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will. 
    Rarity  See you later! 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie I thought everypony loved my parties. 
    Rainbow Dash Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh! 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash! Wait! 
    Rainbow Dash Phew... 
    Pinkie Pie Where're you going?! 
    Rainbow Dash Ah! 
     
    Pinkie Pie What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie What's in those bags?! 
    Rainbow Dash Applejack! We have a problem! 
    Applejack  
     
    Pinkie Pie I know you're IN THERE! 
    Applejack Oh! Howdy, pardner! 
    Pinkie Pie Mind if I... take a look inside the barn? 
    Applejack No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean... you can't come in here! 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash just went in there. 
    Applejack Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some... supplies! Yup, supplies for the... renovation! Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now. 
    Rainbow Dash  You heard her! Construction! 
     
    Applejack Yup! Construction! That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.  
     
    Pinkie Pie Okey... dokey... lokey. 
    Applejack  
     

    Pinkie Pie Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it big time! 

    Spike Wow! Nice spread! 
    Pinkie Pie It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk. 
    Spike That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'. 
    Pinkie Pie No, no, no. Talk about our friends. 
    Spike Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knockout. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that? 
    Pinkie Pie Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess! 
    Spike Confess? 
    Pinkie Pie Confess! 
    Spike I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of "Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions"! 
    Pinkie Pie And? 
    Spike And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath! 
    Pinkie Pie Aaand? 
    Spike And sometimes... when no one's around... I do this Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good! 
    Pinkie Pie No! No! No! No! 
    Spike W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it! 
    Pinkie Pie Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore!  
    Spike Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore! 
    Pinkie Pie Aha! I knew it!  Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore. 
    Spike Uh... so...  
    Pinkie Pie  

    Pinkie Pie Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy. 
    Pinkie Pie voicing a bucket of turnips Could I have some more punch? 
    Pinkie Pie Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr. Turnip.  
    Pinkie Pie voicing a pile of rocks This is one great pahty! You really outdone yourself! 
    Pinkie Pie Why, thank you, Rocky. 
    Pinkie Pie voicing a clump of lint I'm having a delightful time as well. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm so glad, Sir Lintsalot.  
    Pinkie Pie voicing a bag of flour Might I trouble you for anozer slice of cake? 
    Pinkie Pie Anything for you, Madame le Flour. 
    Pinkie Pie  I'm just glad none o' them ponies showed up. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, they're not so bad. 
     
    Rocky Not so bad? Puh-lease! They're a buncha losers! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, c'mon now. "Losers" might be a little strong, dont'cha think? 
    Sir Lintsalot After the way they treated you? I say "losers" isn't strong enough. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, it was pretty rude... 
    Madame le Flour Pretty rude? It was downright deespicable! 
    Pinkie Pie It was, wasn't it? 
    Mr. Turnip If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again. 
    Pinkie Pie You know what? I'm not gonna speak to them ever again. And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don't deserve to be invited to my parties.  Not after the way they've been acting. 
    Madame le Flour  Deeespicable! 
    Sir Lintsalot Such losers! 
    Madame le Flour Yes, zat's right. 
    Pinkie Pie  Well done. 
    Pinkie Pie  Yeah! 
    Pinkie Pie  You show 'em! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Who could that be? 
    Rainbow Dash Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, "Hello." You know how it goes. 
    Pinkie Pie I know how it goes, all right! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres? 
    Pinkie Pie No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends. Isn't that right, Madame le Flour? 
    Pinkie Pie  Oui! Zat iz correct, madame. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot? 
    Pinkie Pie  I'd love one. 
    Rainbow Dash Aaallrighty. What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's... 
    Pinkie Pie  She's not going anywhere. 
    Pinkie Pie I most certainly am not. I'm having a wonderful time right here. 
    Rainbow Dash You should really just come with me. 
    Pinkie Pie  You heard the lady! She ain't goin' nowheres, chump! 
    Rainbow Dash Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh... That's it. Party's over. Come on, Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie No! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie, let's go! 
    Pinkie Pie I said no! 
    Rainbow Dash You...  have to... come with... me! 
    Pinkie Pie No... I... Don't! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We'll do this the hard way! 

    Rainbow Dash  We're... here... 
    Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy  Surprise! 
    Fluttershy I really thought she'd be more excited. 
    Pinkie Pie Excited? Excited?! Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Farewell party? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A "Farewell to Pinkie Pie" party! 
    Applejack Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube? 
    Pinkie Pie Why? Why? Why?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise. 
    Rarity We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours. 
    Twilight Sparkle If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say "Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie"? 
    Pinkie Pie  Because it's my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday? 
     
    Pinkie Pie And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party! 
    Rarity That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling. 
    Pinkie Pie You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh-huh! It sure would. 
    Fluttershy Don't worry about it. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash You don't wanna know. 
    Applejack All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart. 

    Your faithful student, 
    Twilight Sparkle 

    Pinkie Pie You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it. 
    Fluttershy Oh, definitely. 
    Rarity Aww, he was upset? 
    Applejack Uh-huh, sure! 
    Rainbow Dash For Gummy, yeah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, why not? Let's have a party for Gummy.  

     
     

The Best Night Ever

    Pinkie Pie Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate. 
    Rarity Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty. 
    Pinkie Pie What's Twilight doing? 
    Spike She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala. 
    Rarity Where are the others? It's getting late. 
    Applejack Hold your horses, girl. We're here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Perfect! I'm ready. 
    Rainbow Dash For what? 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, Spike. 
    Pinkie Pie An apple! Are we having pie? 
    Spike Shh! Watch! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends? 
    Fluttershy Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle You have my word. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ta-da! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight. 
    Fluttershy Opalescence, no! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala? 
    Rarity Whatever shall we do? 
    Rarity Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala? 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Yeah. Right. 

     

    Pinkie Pie Ooh! 
    Spike Come on, you guys. Let me in! 
    Rainbow Dash Sure thing, Spike. 
    Rarity Heavens no! We're getting dressed. 
    Applejack Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes. 
    Rarity  I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards. 
    Spike I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our hometown, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... I-I don't know, Spike. 
    Rarity We'll just have to see. 
    Applejack We're gonna be a mite busy. 
    Pinkie Pie Busy having fun!  
    Spike Oh. Okay. 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together. 
    Spike Great! 

    Spike 'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop. 
     
    Spike Then let's get moving! Hyah! 
    Caramel Excuse me!? 
    Spike Um... I... 
    Lucky Clover If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph. 

    Spike Whoa! You all look... amazing! 

    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!

        Perform for crowds of thousands 
        They'll shower us with diamonds 
        The Wonderbolts will see me right here at the Gala! 

    

        All we've longed for

    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia! 
    Princess Celestia Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on. 
    Princess Celestia Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's just what I was hoping you'd say. 

    Rarity  Hurry, Rarity... Oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... Wait! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined. 

     
    Fluttershy Oh my! A meadowlark! 
     
    Fluttershy I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for!  
     

    Applejack Howdy, partner! You hungry? 
    Soarin As a horse! 
    Applejack Well, what'cha hankering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries? 
    Soarin I'll take that big apple pie! 
    Applejack Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yee-haw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected. 

    Spitfire Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin? 
    Soarin Heh. Yeah!  My pie! You saved it. Thanks. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, no prob. 
    Spitfire Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won The Best Flyer Competition. 
    Rainbow Dash Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash. 
    Spitfire Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, well, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie. 
    Soarin  Yeah... 
    Spitfire Wanna come hang out with us? 
    Rainbow Dash Sure. Why not? I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!  

    Pinkie Pie The shiny dance floor... The pretty party ponies... Ooh, the fancy band... Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!  Gotta dance! 

    

        I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, 
        I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, 
        I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala, 
        It's all I ever dreamed. 

        It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo! 
        It's all I ever dreamed, yippee! 
        I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
         

        It's all I've ever... dreamed? 

    Prince Blueblood Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood. 
    Rarity I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose. 
    Prince Blueblood You mean... this rose? Thank you. It goes with my eyes. 
    Rarity  

    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy  My little meadowlark is right around this bend! 
    Mr. Greenhooves  
    Fluttershy Was that you? 
    Mr. Greenhooves Yep! I love whistlin' while I work.  
    Fluttershy Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo? Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?  You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome! 

    Princess Celestia Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala. 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and... 
    Princess Celestia Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself. 

    Applejack First minute, first sale. Second... Fourth... Sixth... Sixtieth minute... no sales.  This ain't what I expected at all. 

    Pinkie Pie I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed. 

    Rarity This isn't at all what I imagined. 

    Princess Celestia  Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome! 
    Twilight Sparkle This isn't what I hoped. 

    Rainbow Dash This isn't hanging out. 

    Fluttershy This isn't what I wished for. 

    Twilight Sparkle No! 
    Rarity I waited all my life... 
    Fluttershy ...for this moment! 
    Pinkie Pie And I'm not going to... 
    Applejack ...let it slip by! 
    Rainbow Dash If it's the last thing I do... 
    Twilight Sparkle ...I'm gonna make this... 
    All ...the best night ever! 

    Fluttershy I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.  I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out! 
     
    Fluttershy Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend? 
    Mr. Greenhooves Mmm... Sounds good to me. 

    Rainbow Dash Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you.  
    Count Caesar  

    Rarity Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient. 
    Prince Blueblood Miss Rarity! Stop! 
    Rarity Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous. 
    Prince Blueblood One would hate to slip. 
    Rarity Yes. One certainly would. 
    Prince Blueblood One's cloak should take care of the problem. 
    Rarity Oh, of course it will. 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Pinkie Pie C'mon, everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs! 

    

        You reach your right hoof in 
        You reach your right hoof out 
        You reach your right hoof in 
        And you shake it all about 
        You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout 
        That's what I'm talking about 

        You step your left hoof in 
        You pull it right back out 
        You step your left hoof in 
        But you better help him out 
        You do the Pony Pokey but should find a different route 
        That's what it's all about 

        You kick your back left in 
        You pull your back left out 
        You reach your back left in 
        Just be brave and have no doubt 
        You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout 
        That's what I'm singing about 

        You tilt your head in 
        You tilt your head out 
        You tilt your head in 
        Then you shake it all about 
        You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout 
        You're better off without 

        You stomp your whole self in 
        You stomp your whole self out 
        You stomp your whole self in 
        And you stomp yourself about 
        You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout- 

    Fluttershy COME OUT! 

    

        That's what I'm talking about 

        You do the Pony Pokey 
        You do the Pony Pokey 
        You do the Pony Pokey 
        And that's what it's all about 

        Yeah! 

    Lyrica Lilac Young lady, this is not that kind of party. 
    Pinkie Pie Ohhhhhh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay! 

    Rarity Two apple fritters, please. 
    Applejack Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits. 
    Rarity Ahem. 
    Prince Blueblood Ahem. 
    Rarity Ahem! 
    Prince Blueblood Ahem! 
    Rarity  I'm going to have to pay, aren't I? 
    Applejack It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered. 
    Rarity Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners. 
    Prince Blueblood  Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare! I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres. 
    Applejack Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em. 

    Fluttershy I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be mine! Mine!  Whoa! 

    Pinkie Pie Come on, everypony! You wanted a partay? Now it's paaartaaay! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo! 
    Applejack Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds. 
    Pinkie Pie Stage dive! 
    Rarity and Prince Blueblood  
    Rarity  You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact, the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain! 
    Prince Blueblood Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed! 
    Rarity Afraid to get dirty?!  
    Prince Blueblood  
    Rainbow Dash This is my chance! Yes! Whoa! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well... it can't get any worse. 
     
     
     
    Fluttershy You're... going to love me! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Um, um, uh... Eugh. 
    Princess Celestia Run. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you. 
    Rarity  No! Ugh! Let's go! 

    Spike Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut. 
    Joe Don't you think you've had enough? 
    Spike Another donut! Extra sprinkles! 
     
    Joe Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see. 
    Spike Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever? 

    Spike That sounds like the worst night ever! 
    Everypony It was!  
    Twilight Sparkle I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala. 
    Princess Celestia That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever! 
    Everypony Princess Celestia! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful. 
    Princess Celestia Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful. 
    Twilight Sparkle It is? 
    Princess Celestia That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Hanging out with friends! 
    Fluttershy Talking! 
    Pinkie Pie Laughing! 
    Spike You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, Spike. You were right. 
    Applejack As horrible as our night was... 
    Rarity ...being together here has made it all better. 
    Pinkie Pie In fact, it's made it... 
    All (except Celestia) ...the best night ever!  

     
     

The Return of Harmony Part 1

    Cheerilee I want to start our field trip here, in the world-famous Canterlot sculpture garden. That one over there represents "Friendship". All right, my little ponies, this one represents "Victory". 
    Scootaloo How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark? 
    Apple Bloom Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'. 
    Sweetie Belle That's not a word! 
    Scootaloo What are you, a dictionary? 
    Cheerilee Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it? 
    Apple Bloom It's got an eagle claw! 
    Scootaloo And a lion paw! 
    Sweetie Belle And a snake tail! 
    Cheerilee This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents? 
    Apple Bloom Confusion! 
    Sweetie Belle Evil! 
    Scootaloo Chaos! 
    Sweetie Belle It's not chaos, you dodo! 
    Scootaloo Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos! 
    Sweetie Belle Is not! 
    Apple Bloom You're both wrong! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Cheerilee Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents "Discord", which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it. 
    Group  
    Cheerilee Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting. 
    Apple Bloom It's confusion! 
    Sweetie Belle Evil! 
    Scootaloo Chaos! 
     
    Discord  

     

    Rainbow Dash Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy? 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't justâ€“ 
     
    Rainbow Dash You did. 

    Rainbow Dash Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere! 
    Applejack Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?! 
    Rainbow Dash There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Why would you wanna stop this?  
    Rarity Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella. 
     
    Applejack Fluttershy! Do somethin'! 
    Fluttershy Now, Angel, you really shouldn'tâ€“ No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything. 
    Twilight Sparkle My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do? 
    Spike Uh, give up? 
    Rarity Spike, Twilight will come up with something. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky? 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, what happened? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them. 
    Pinkie Pie You and me both, sister! Hey! 
    Applejack And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert. 
    Twilight Sparkle You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately! 

    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could! 
    Princess Celestia Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is thereâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia Follow me. 

    Princess Celestia I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord. 
    Fluttershy  
    Princess Celestia Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone. 
    Rainbow Dash All right, Princess! 
    Princess Celestia I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken. 
    Twilight Sparkle No longer connected? 
    Princess Celestia This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos. 
    Twilight Sparkle But why us? Why don't youâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, look! We're famous! 
    Princess Celestia You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord! 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia, you can count onâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again. 
    Rarity Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case! 
    Princess Celestia Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these! 
    All  
    Pinkie Pie Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw. 

    Twilight Sparkle The Elements! They're gone! 
    Princess Celestia That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense! 
    Discord  Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense? 
    Princess Celestia Discord... Show yourself! 
    Discord  Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone. 
    Princess Celestia Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony? 
    Discord Oh, I just borrowed them for a teensy little while.  
    Princess Celestia You'll never get away with this, Discord! 
    Discord Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey! Nopony insults the Princess! 
     
    Discord Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent. 
    Rainbow Dash That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess! 
    Discord We'll see about that. 
    Rarity I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window. 
    Discord The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken? 
    Applejack So you know who we are, big deal. 
    Discord Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack. 
    Twilight Sparkle You seem to know our strengths too. 
    Discord Yes, Twilight Sparkle, and yours is the most powerful and elusive element, magic. Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's is a personal favorite of mine - laughter.  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie  He's standing on your head! 
    Princess Celestia Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony? 
    Discord Oh, so boring, Celestia. Really? Fine, I'll tell you, but I'll only tell you my way. To retrieve your missing Elements, just make sense of this change of events. Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began.  
    Fluttershy Can we go home now? 
    Applejack What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started? 
    Twilight Sparkle Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth! 
    Princess Celestia Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down. 
    Discord  

    All  
    Fluttershy W-We have to go in there? 
    Rainbow Dash Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings! 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle and Rarity Your horn! My horn! Ahhh! 
    Discord  
    Twilight Sparkle Give us our wings and horns back! 
    Discord You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game no flying, and no magic. 
    Rainbow Dash The first rule? 
    Discord The second rule is everypony has to play or the game is over, and I win. Good luck, everypony!  
    Twilight Sparkle Never fear, girls. We have each other! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together! 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, girls, let's do this! 
    All Together!  
    Twilight Sparkle Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there! 
    Rainbow Dash Moving out! 
    Rarity See you in the center. 
    Applejack Yee-haw! 
    Pinkie Pie See you guys there! 
    Fluttershy  What's that? Who's there? Girls! 

    Applejack What in tarnation? Where am I? 
    Apples  
    Applejack Who are y'all? 
    Red apples The keepers of the grove of truth. You may ask us... 
    Light-red apples ...one question... 
    Green apples ...past, future or present. 
    Red apples But be warned... 
    Light-red apples ...that the truth... 
    Green apples ...may not always be pleasant. 
    Applejack All right then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on? 
    Red apples For the answer you seek... 
    Light-red apples ...go ahead, take a peek. 
    Pond Rainbow Dash I hope I never see you again! 
    Pond Fluttershy Me too! 
    Pond Pinkie Pie Fine! 
    Pond Rarity Fine! 
    Pond Twilight Sparkle It's settled then. 
    Applejack No! Our friendship? Over?! 
    Discord  
    Applejack It can't be true. It just can't! 

    Applejack That just can't be the truth. 
    Light-red apples When all the truth does... 
    Green apples ...is make your heart ache... 
    Green apples and Discord ...sometimes a lie is easier to take.  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to? 
    Applejack I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever! 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Applejack Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going. 
    Twilight Sparkle Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie. 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Balloons  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Balloons  
    Pinkie Pie Hey, what gives? 
    Discord What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh? 
    Pinkie Pie It's different. They're laughing at me. 
    Discord It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time. 
    Pinkie Pie My friends laugh with me, not at me. 
    Discord Oh, really?  
    Pinkie Pie No! Stop it! 
    Balloons  
    Pinkie Pie Stop laughing at me! 
    Discord Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy. 
    Pinkie Pie  Happy? I don't think so. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her. 
    Applejack I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie. 
    Twilight Sparkle Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us. 

    Rarity I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sports. Agh. Oh my... 
    Discord  Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like? 
    Rarity Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others.  Mine! 

    Rarity Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home.  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder? 
    Rarity What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square!  

    Fluttershy  Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here! 
    Butterflies Fluttershy, looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends, huh? 
    Fluttershy Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me. 
    Butterflies Well, it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are. 
    Fluttershy Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding. 
    Butterflies Yes... Well, surely it burns you up... I mean, that they're always pointing out your flaws, right? 
    Fluttershy Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be. 
    Discord Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony. 
    Applejack Grrr... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... 
    Fluttershy Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one. 
    Twilight Sparkle What is happening to my friends? 
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie And what are you laughing at? 
    Applejack Chocolate milk. 
    Rarity Little help here! Thanks, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're welcomeâ€“ 
    Rarity But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live. 

     
    Rainbow Dash I've got you now, element. 
    Discord Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush. 
    Rainbow Dash Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go! 
    Discord Hey, I'm here to deliver a message. 
    Rainbow Dash I've got a message for you too! 
    Discord Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make a right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No! 
    Discord That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice. 

    Twilight Sparkle Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down. 
    Applejack Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Now I know that's a lie.  How can it be? 
     
    Discord Well, well, well. Somepony broke the "no wings; no magic" rule.  
     

     
     

The Return of Harmony Part 2

     

    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could. 

    Princess Celestia I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord. 

    Twilight Sparkle The Elements! They're gone! 

    Discord  Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win. 

    Applejack Our friendship...over? 

    Twilight Sparkle Who are you talking to? 
    Applejack Nopony! Nopony whatsoever. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you! 
    Pinkie Pie Why? Need a good laugh? 

    Twilight Sparkle What is happening to my friends? 

    Discord Looks like we might be due for a big old storm of chaos.  

     

    Discord  
    Pinkie Pie And what are you laughing at!? 
    Discord Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie! 
    Fluttershy Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha. 
    Pinkie Pie Quit it! 
    Fluttershy No. Ha, ha. 
    Pinkie Pie Quit it! 
    Fluttershy No. Ha ha-ha ha ha. 
    Applejack Uh... Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together. 
    Rarity HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya! 
    Twilight Sparkle Girls, why are you all acting like this? 
    Pinkie Pie Quit it! Stop it! 
    Twilight Sparkle We need to stick together. 
    Fluttershy Ha, ha. 
    Discord  It's just too entertaining. 
    Twilight Sparkle Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair. 
    Discord I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello? 
    Twilight Sparkle How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end? 
    Discord Oh, wait, did you...?  How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth? 
    Flashback Discord Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began. 
    Discord I never said they were in the labyrinth. 
    Twilight Sparkle But...but... 
    Discord Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.  Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak. 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Think, Twilight, think! "Find the Elements back where you began." Back where you began. 
    Rarity Don't touch my gem! 
    Fluttershy I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha. 
    Pinkie Pie What 'chu laughin' at? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! "Back where you began!" The Elements must be in... Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah! 
    Fluttershy Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud. 
    Applejack Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wah! Ahh! Whoa! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap! 
    Discord Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes. 
    Pinkie Pie This may look like fun, but it's not. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. 
    Discord Picture it. The chaos capital of the world. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't picture anything. It's too dark.  
    Discord Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it. 
    Fluttershy Don't worry, you won't.  
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please? 
    Applejack I absolutely refuse. 
    Fluttershy With pleasure. 
    Pinkie Pie I hate libraries! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Pleeeease, we gotta hurry! 
    Rarity Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom! 
    Twilight Sparkle Tom? 
    Rarity Well, it's not going to work. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're not going in without him, are you? 
    Rarity Mm-mm. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Fine! 
    Spike  
     
    Spike Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy 'Cause you just looked so peaceful. 
    Spike I...uh...huh? 
     
    Rarity Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, for the love of... 
    Spike Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so...gray? 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't ask. I need you to help me find something. 
    Fluttershy Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless? 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, I've had just about enoughâ€“  
    Fluttershy Your face!  
    Spike What's happened to everypony? 
    Applejack I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret! 
    Spike The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it! 
    Fluttershy Hah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book! 
    Fluttershy  Keep away! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! Applejack, give me that book! 
    Applejack I don't have any book. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now! 
    Spike Ugh! 
    Rarity Mine! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, do you even know what you just stole? 
    Rarity No, but if you want it, I want it! 
    Twilight Sparkle  GIVE ME THAT BOOK! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Where is she? Where's Rarity? 
    Applejack Beats me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Lies! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Get back! All of you! This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT!  The Elements! 

    Twilight Sparkle The Elements! They were here all along! 
    Spike This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal! 
    Twilight Sparkle See, girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together! 
    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle You don't even care, do you? 
    All No! 
    Twilight Sparkle  I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on, everypony, let's go! 
    Spike But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute. That just about covers it. 
    Spike But what about Rainbow Dash? 
    Twilight Sparkle Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go! 
    Spike  That won't end well. 
    Twilight Sparkle Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again! 
    All but Rarity Yeah! Woo-hoo! 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Move! Look out, here comes Tom! 
     
    Discord Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying! 
    Twilight Sparkle Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now! 
    Discord I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle Formation, now! 
    All Eh. 
    Twilight Sparkle "Rainbow Dash", get over here. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle All right, let's get this over with. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on? 
    Applejack Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours. 
    Pinkie Pie I HATE the Elements of Harmony! 
    Fluttershy Hmph! Garbage. 
    Rarity MINE! 
    Spike Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all thisâ€“ whoa! 
    Fluttershy  
    Discord Bravo, ponies, bravo!  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie It's your fault it didn't work. 
    Twilight Sparkle Who are you talking to? 
    Pinkie Pie Any of you! ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here! 
    Applejack I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm. 
    Fluttershy Yeah! I'm sick of you losers. 
    Twilight Sparkle FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...? 
     

     
    Discord  Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did. 
    Berryshine  
    Discord It's priceless!  Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not anymore... 
    Discord YES!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here. 
    Spike Can't...move. The princess...has been sending these...since I came back upstairs.  Make it stop! 
    Twilight Sparkle These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle "Real friends don't care what your cover is." 
    "Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing." 
    "And like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through." 
    "The best thing to do is stay true to yourself." 
    "Everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. Maybe even before she's met them." 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself. 
    Spike  

    Applejack And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship. 
    Applejack Oh, now you want to fight. Where you went when I was battlin' Discord? 
    Twilight Sparkle Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar. 
    Applejack Wh-what happened? Twilight!  I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me? 
    Twilight Sparkle I already have. Come on! 

    Fluttershy Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream! 

    Rarity  What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--! 
    Rarity  Let us never speak of this again. 

    Pinkie Pie  Can you believe it?! 

    Fluttershy Uh? She's not here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements. 
    Applejack She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, guys! 
    Twilight Sparkle We've been looking everywhere for you! 
    Rainbow Dash That's nice. 
    Twilight Sparkle Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty! 
    Rainbow Dash Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome. 
    Rarity How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale? 
    Applejack The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond. 
    Rarity I thought we agreed never to speak of that again. 
    Twilight Sparkle Time for Plan B. 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her. 
    Fluttershy Got it! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh... 
    Rainbow Dash Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack! 
    Rarity and Pinkie Pie WHOA! 
    Rarity PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE! 
    Pinkie Pie Oops. 
    Applejack Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down! 
    Rarity Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please? 
    Fluttershy  I can't! 
    Twilight Sparkle If you can't catch her, Discord wins! 
    Fluttershy That big... dumb... MEANIE! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count! 

    Rainbow Dash Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone! 
    Rainbow Dash Wh-what happened?  How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord? 
    All  
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe it's a little early for a group hug. 

    Discord  Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not as wonderful as friendship. 
    Discord Oh, this again? 
     
    Applejack That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long. 
    Discord Oh, Applejack, don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar. Will you ever learn?  
    Twilight Sparkle I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for! 
    Discord Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead, try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here. 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait-wait-wait!  
    Discord Huh. What's this? No. NO!!! 
     

     
    Princess Celestia We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.

Lesson Zero

    Twilight Sparkle Quill. 
    Spike Check. 
    Twilight Sparkle Parchment. 
    Spike Check. 
    Twilight Sparkle Extra ink. 
    Spike Check. 
    Twilight Sparkle Extra extra ink. 
    Spike Check. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is that everything on the checklist? 
    Spike Yep. 
    Twilight Sparkle Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready? 
    Spike Ready! 
    Twilight Sparkle Item 1 Create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day. 
    Spike  

     

    Twilight Sparkle How are we doing, Spike? 
    Spike Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop... 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago. 
    Spike Can't imagine why we go through so many of them. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next? 
    Spike Cupcakes! 

    Spike Whoa... 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I only ordered twelve. 
    Mrs Cake Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra. So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen. 
    Spike Uhhh-no! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See? 
    Mrs Cake Ohh... sure... 
    Twilight Sparkle It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing. 
    Mrs Cake Oh, no... of course not. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect! 
    Mrs Cake Hmm, oh yes... much better... 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Very efficient! And a little bit gross. 
    Spike Eh. 

    Spike Looks like that's everything! 
    Twilight Sparkle Almost everything. 
    Spike "Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!" Uh... check! Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word! 
    Twilight Sparkle We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?! 
    Spike Why? Is that bad? 
    Twilight Sparkle Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every ten days, every... single... week! 
    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?! 
    Spike Where it.. always is? 
    Twilight Sparkle When did we send the last one? 
    Spike Last... Tuesday? 
    Twilight Sparkle And today is... 
    Spike Tuesday? 
    Twilight Sparkle Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy! 
    Spike What's that now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment. 
    Spike Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me? 
    Spike Yeah... I don't think she-- 
    Twilight Sparkle What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously? 
    Spike Why would she-- 
    Twilight Sparkle What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?! 
    Spike Well, why wouldn't you pass-- 
    Twilight Sparkle She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten. 
    Various fillies  
    Spike Twilight? Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Spike That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve? 
    Spike Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does. 
    Spike  This won't end well. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend! 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity! 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here! 
    Rarity  WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's happened? Are you alright? 
    Rarity  I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi-- 
    Rarity Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look? 
    Twilight Sparkle So... you just lost your ribbon? 
    Rarity Mm-hm! 
    Twilight Sparkle But now you've found it? 
    Rarity Yuh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend could help you with? 
    Rarity Hmm... there is one thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? 
    Rarity I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Measuring tape? Sure. 
    Rarity Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight? 

     
    Twilight Sparkle No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Twilight Sparkle What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, what are you talking about? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight. 

    Twilight Sparkle Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack. 
    Rainbow Dash I don't have any issues with Applejack. 
    Twilight Sparkle You don't? Then why are you destroying her property? 
    Rainbow Dash Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack? 
    Applejack Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D. 
    Rainbow Dash You got it, boss! 
    Applejack I'd take cover if I were you. 
    Twilight Sparkle

    Twilight Sparkle  

     
    Twilight Sparkle  I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her. 
    Bear  
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?! 
    Fluttershy You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder. 
    Bear  

    Twilight Sparkle It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together! 
    Spike Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight? 
    Fillies  
    Spike Snap out of it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Spike Are you okay? 
    Fillies  
    Spike Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with-- 
    Twilight Sparkle The picnic! I should go see my friends! 
    Spike I'm glad you've come to your senses. 

    Rarity Please tell me I did not forget the plates.  Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you? 
     
    Applejack You alright, hun? 
    Twilight Sparkle No! I am not alright. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle It's just terrible. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity Yes? 
    Twilight Sparkle Simply awful. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity Yes!? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity YES!? 
    Twilight Sparkle My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Fluttershy Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Applejack No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before. 
    Rarity Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking... 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, girls!  
    Apple Bloom Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go-- 
    Twilight Sparkle Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you! 
    Scootaloo Uhh... she's... great. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah. Great. 
    Sweetie Belle I really... like her... mane. 
    Twilight Sparkle She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework! 
    Scootaloo That's... um... great. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah... great. 
    Sweetie Belle I really like her... mane? 
    Twilight Sparkle I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first? 
    Apple Bloom Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much. 
    Sweetie Belle Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first. 
    Scootaloo I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom. 
    Apple Bloom Applejack says it's important to share. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything. 
    Scootaloo  I want it. 
    Apple Bloom I need it. 
    Sweetie Belle I really like her mane! 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Twilight Sparkle The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- Ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share? 
    Apple Bloom No way! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me? 
    Big McIntosh Nnnope. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! 
    Apple Bloom Give her back! 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Mayor Mare What's all the commotion about? 
    Orange Swirl They're fighting over that doll! 
    Sweetie Drops That incredible, amazing doll! 
    Many ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle Can't... get... a clear shot!  
    Mayor Mare Gimme! 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, what have I done?! 

    Ponies  
    Applejack Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't look at it! 
    Rarity Don't look at what? 
    Twilight Sparkle My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her! 
    Fluttershy Why would you enchant your doll? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over! 
    Applejack Not almost! 
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle! 
    Applejack Whoa nelly. 
     
    Big McIntosh  
    Princess Celestia Meet me in the library. 
    Twilight Sparkle Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot. 
    Fluttershy Magic kindergarten? 
    Rainbow Dash Canterlot? 
    Pinkie Pie We're never gonna see Twilight again! 
    Applejack Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all? 
    Rarity Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time! 

    Twilight Sparkle But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy! 
    Princess Celestia You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Rainbow Dash Wait! 
    Pinkie Pie You can't punish her! 
    Applejack It wasn't her fault! 
    Princess Celestia I'm listening. 
    Fluttershy Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset. 
    Rainbow Dash But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about. 
    Applejack So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her. 
    Rarity As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her! 
    Fluttershy Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her. 
    Princess Celestia Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity Mm-hmm. 
    Princess Celestia Very well. I'll forget Twilight's "punishment" on one condition. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Princess Celestia From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble? 
    Princess Celestia Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail. 
    Applejack Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter. 

    Applejack  Dear Princess Celestia, 
    We're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship. 
    Fluttershy We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously. 
    Rainbow Dash Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about. 
    Rarity And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem... 
    Pinkie Pie ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem. 
    Applejack Signed, your loyal subjects. 
    Spike P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um... 
    Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Spike  

     
     

Luna Eclipsed

    Spike Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history? 
    Spike Uh..  
    Fillies Nightmare Night! What a fright! Give us something sweet to bite! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith. 
    Granny Smith I should have been asleep five hours ago. 
    Pipsqueak Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night. 
    Twilight Sparkle Since you moved here from Trottingham? 
    Pipsqueak No, my very first Nightmare Night ever! 
    Pinkie Pie  Enough chitchat! Time is candy! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this? 
    Pinkie Pie Too old for free candy?  Never. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Do you like it? 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown! 
    Twilight Sparkle A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched! 
    Spike It's a great costume! Huh! Grandpa! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Twilight Sparkle Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era. 
    Background ponies Yeah! Whoo-hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike? 
    Spike  I love it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat? 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip? 
    Pipsqueak Sure did! 
    Pinkie Pie And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and -â€“

    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice. 
    Rainbow Dash Lighten up, old-timer. This is the best night of the year for pranks! 
    Twilight Sparkle Look what you did to Spike! 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash It's all in good fun. Oh! Oh! There's another group over there! 
     
    Background ponies  
    Rainbow Dash  

    Twilight Sparkle Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack! 
    Applejack Howdy, Spike! Hey, Twilight! Nice costume. 
    Spike Thanks! I'm a dragon. 
    Twilight Sparkle She means me, Spike. 
    Applejack With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  
    Applejack While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple? 
     
    Mayor Mare Thank you, everypony, and welcome to the Nightmare Night festival! 
     
    Mayor Mare Now, all the little ponies who have been out collecting sweets should follow our friend Zecora to hear the legend of... Nightmare Moon!  
    Spike Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Zecora Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon. 

    Zecora Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.  Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary. 
    All  
    Zecora Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes. 
    Foals  
    Zecora But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing to gobble up ponies in one quick swing! 
    Pipsqueak and Pinkie Pie  
    Zecora Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year! 
    Pipsqueak Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy? 
    Zecora A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.  Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you! 
    Pinkie Pie  Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here! 
     
     
    All  
    Pinkie Pie  It's Nightmare Moon! Run! 
    All  
     

    All  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Princess Luna! 
    Cloud Kicker  
    Princess Luna  Citizens of Ponyville! We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all! 
    All  
    Princess Luna  Madame Mayor, thy Princess of the Night hath arrived. 
    Mayor Mare  
    Raven  
    Princess Luna What is the matter with you? Very well, then. Be that way. We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm gonna go talk to her. 
    Spike You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years. 

    Twilight Sparkle Princess Luna? Hi, my name is -â€“ 
    Princess Luna Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is -â€“ 
    Princess Luna Twilight Sparkle.  It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers! 
    Twilight Sparkle And that was a good thing, right? 
    Princess Luna  But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me. 
    Princess Luna But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal "we", and to use  this much volume when addressing our subjects! 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception. 
    Princess Luna  Change our approach? 
    Twilight Sparkle Lower the volume? 
    Princess Luna  Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can. 

    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice. 
    Fluttershy Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight! 
    Fluttershy It is you. Ah, and Nightmare Moon.  
    Twilight Sparkle  Wait right here. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna? 
    Princess Luna  Charmed. 
    Fluttershy  Likewise. 
    Princess Luna  Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest. 
    Fluttershy  Okay. 
    Princess Luna  Shall our lessons begin? 
    Fluttershy  Okay. 
    Princess Luna  Shall we mimic thy voice? 
    Fluttershy  Okay. 
    Princess Luna  How is this? 
    Fluttershy  Perfect, lesson over! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle A little quieter, princess. 
    Princess Luna  this? 
    Twilight Sparkle Better. Right, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy  Yes. 
    Princess Luna  How... about... now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Now you're getting it. 
    Princess Luna  And... how about now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes! Well done. 
    Princess Luna  I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers. 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and...  Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up! 
    Foals  
    Princess Luna  I mean... nay, children, no, wait. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, princess. Time for plan B. 

    All Hurray! 
    Several ponies  
    Sassaflash Aah! 
    Princess Luna It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall. 
    Twilight Sparkle My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas. 
    Pipsqueak Heee...! 
    Applejack Whoop. Careful there, partner.  
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here. 
    Applejack "Fit in"? Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun. 
    Princess Luna Fun? What is this "fun" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve? 
    Cherry Berry Try to land the sp-sp-spiders on the web. 
    Applejack You can do it, princess! 
    Princess Luna Ha! Your princess enjoys this "fun"! In what other ways may we experience it? 

    Twilight Sparkle Fire away, princess! 
    Princess Luna Ha ha! The fun has been doubled! 
    All Hurray!  
    Applejack Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess. 
    Princess Luna I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna! 
    All Luna...  
    Princess Luna Show me to these bobbing apples. 
    Pipsqueak Whoa!  
    Pinkie Pie Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to runâ€“  Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run! 
    Fillies  
    Pipsqueak Help! My backside has been gobbled! 
    Princess Luna 'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp!  Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun! 
     
    Princess Luna Not enough fun for you? What say you to this!? 
    Citizens  
    Princess Luna Huzzah! How many points do I receive? 
    Golden Harvest  
    Citizens  
    Princess Luna Do not run away! 
    Daisy  
    Princess Luna As your princess, we command you! 
    Citizens  
    Princess Luna  Be still! 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess, remember! Watch the screaming! 
    Princess Luna  No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled! Forever! 
     

    Applejack  Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em. 
    Noi  But I wanted to be a zombie next year. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not over yet. 
    Applejack What are you gonna do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her! 

    Twilight Sparkle Princess? 
    Princess Luna Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle. 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have. 
    Princess Luna Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away. 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess... 

    Ponies  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay? 
    Pinkie Pie  Okay. 
    Twilight Sparkle There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek? 
    Pinkie Pie Mm-hmm.  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right? 
    Princess Luna Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Nightmare Moon!  
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, duh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up? 
    Twilight Sparkle So why do you keep running away and screaming? 
    Pinkie Pie Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius! 
    Pinkie Pie No, I'm not. I'm a chicken.  
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked! 
    Princess Luna  Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way. 

    Pipsqueak Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last. 
    Zecora Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live. 
    Mayor Mare Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you? 
    Spike Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me. 
    Applejack Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun? 

    Pipsqueak Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever. 
     
    Nightmare Moon  Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you! 
    Ponies  
    Princess Luna  I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just wait. 
    Princess Luna For what? For... for them to scream some more? 
    Pipsqueak Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway? 
    Princess Luna Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you? 
    Pipsqueak It's really fun! Scary, but fun! 
    Princess Luna It... is? 
    Pipsqueak Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year. 
    Princess Luna Well then. We shall have to bring  Nightmare Night back! 
    Pipsqueak Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever!  She said yes, guys! 
    Foals YAY! 
    Twilight Sparkle See? They really do like you, princess. 
    Princess Luna Can it be true?  I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights. 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Celestia, 
    When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem -- your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!

    Rarity  
    Hondo Flanks Well! G'mornin', Rarity! 
    Rarity Father! Mother! 
    Hondo Flanks I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own. 
    Rarity I... figured.  I didn't know you could burn juice. 
    Cookie Crumbles I've been giving her lessons. I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation. 
    Rarity Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess apple sauce? 
    Sweetie Belle Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon. 
    Rarity So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days? 
    Cookie Crumbles And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis. 
    Hondo Flanks You gonna eat that? 
    Rarity But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Just a few necessities. 

     
    Rarity Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up. 
    Sweetie Belle Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet. 
    Rarity Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt. 
    Sweetie Belle It's not that burnt. 
    Rarity Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going. 
    Sweetie Belle Can I help? 
    Rarity Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started. 

    Sweetie Belle Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help! 
    Rarity You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates. 
    Sweetie Belle You mean this parsley? 
    Rarity Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here... 
    Sweetie Belle Whoa, whoa! 
     
    Rarity Not... bad. 

    Rarity  There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room? 
    Sweetie Belle No problem, I'll make myself useful! 

    Rarity Sweetie Belle! 
    Sweetie Belle I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised? 
    Rarity Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by? 
    Sweetie Belle What's the big deal? 
    Rarity The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh. Sorry. 
    Rarity Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create. 
    Sweetie Belle Sorry? 
    Rarity Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please? 
    Sweetie Belle I just wanted to do something nice for my sister. 

    Sweetie Belle Raargh, I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work? 
    Rarity  Stay out of trouble, okay? 
    Sweetie Belle I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something... 

    Sweetie Belle Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for yâ€“ 
    Rarity  Oh no! Did you use these gems?! 
    Sweetie Belle Well, yes, but I know you'll have more in your work room... 
    Rarity But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh. Sorry. 
    Rarity  Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you? 
    Sweetie Belle Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fightâ€“ 
    Rarity That's not what I meant! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh. 
    Rarity Now I have to go and find some more of these gems! 
    Sweetie Belle I'll go with you and help! 
    Rarity No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up! 
    Sweetie Belle Geez Louise, can't I do anything right? 

    Rarity Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle?  
    Sweetie Belle Surprise! 
    Rarity My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?! 
    Sweetie Belle When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you. 
    Rarity This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and youâ€“ and you put everything away! 
    Sweetie Belle But every time I make a mess, you get upset! 
    Rarity But this was my mess in my house! And now I have to start from scratch! 
    Sweetie Belle But, I thought it would make you happy! 
    Rarity Happy?! Happy?! Iâ€“  I just need some time alone. Hm! 

    Apple Bloom How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'? 
    Sweetie Belle  Why, it's smashing! 
    Apple Bloom Huh? 
    Sweetie Belle I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up. 
    Apple Bloom The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events! 
    Sweetie Belle That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea. 

    Rarity What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean. 
    Sweetie Belle So, what, now you're back to hating messes? 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister. 
    Sweetie Belle Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes! 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister. 
    Sweetie Belle Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister! 
    Rarity  Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister! 
    Sweetie Belle Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister! 
    Rarity Deal! 
    Sweetie Belle Deal! Goodbye, un-sister! 
    Rarity Hmph! 

    Applejack 'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! Uncouth?  Wait. What's uncouth? 
    Sweetie Belle It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth. 
    Applejack Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth. 
    Apple Bloom  What's uncouth? 
    Applejack It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered? 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do. 
    Sweetie Belle Not sisters like Rarity. 
    Applejack Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help! 
    Sweetie Belle You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up! 
    Applejack Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch! 
    Applejack and Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo! 
    Applejack and Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle This is a chore? 
    Applejack Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat. 
    Apple Bloom It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try? 
    Sweetie Belle Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work. 
    Apple Bloom That's why we do it... 
    Applejack and Apple Bloom Together! 
    Sweetie Belle Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together. 

    Rarity Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.  Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm! 

    Applejack Apple Bloom! You're up! 
    Sweetie Belle You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits. 
    Apple Bloom Well, that's silly! 
    Applejack Apple Bloom... 
    Sweetie Belle Please, Applejack, she didn't meanâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom Whoa!  
    Applejack How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper! 
    Apple Bloom That tickles!  

    Rarity Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm. 

     
    Applejack Apple Bloom! 
    Apple Bloom Got it, sis! 
    Sweetie Belle Wow. It's as if they were just one pony. 
    Applejack and Apple Bloom Yee-haw! 
    Applejack Way to corral some critters, sis! 
    Sheep You coulda just a-a-a-asked. 
    Sweetie Belle Rarity never high-hoofs me. 

    Rarity Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project? 
    Rarity Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!  Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again! 

    Rarity  Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. Iâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you. 
    Rarity Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that. 
    Rarity Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hearâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister! 
    Rarity What?! 
    Applejack What?! 
    Apple Bloom What?! 
    Sweetie Belle A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister. 
    Applejack H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here. 
    Apple Bloom Besides, she's my big sister! 
    Applejack Yeah, umâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle  Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be! 
    Applejack Heh, um, actually, Iâ€“ 
    Rarity But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm? 
    Sweetie Belle Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do? 
    Rarity Uh... yes? 
    Sweetie Belle Just forget it! 
    Apple Bloom We're still sisters, right? 
    Rarity Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad? 
    Applejack  Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'. 
    Rarity But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands. 
    Applejack But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie. 
    Rarity But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess...  I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late! 

    Sweetie Belle Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest? 
    Apple Bloom Look at the size of that pig! 
    Applejack He sure is a cutie. 
    Sweetie Belle That's the last word Rarity would use.  Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover! 
    Applejack It's almost time! 
    Sweetie Belle Well, you two have fun. Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with. Huh? 
    Apple Bloom You do now! 
    Applejack AB and I figured since we do this every year... 
    Apple Bloom I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try! 
    Applejack Sister for a day. 
    Sweetie Belle No way! 
    Apple Bloom One. Day. One. Day. 
    Granny Smith Is this thing on?  That's what I said. 
    Sweetie Belle That's us. 
    Apple Bloom One. Day. Good luck! 
    Granny Smith And may the best sisters win! On your marks... get set... Gooooo! 
    Applejack  
    Sweetie Belle You okay, Applejack? 
    Sweetie Belle Applejack, help! 
    Sweetie Belle You can do it, sister! 
     
    Apple Bloom Ooh, so close! You almost won! 
    Sweetie Belle Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack? 
    Applejack  
    Sweetie Belle I don't get it. 
    Applejack  We switched places over at the very first mudhole. 
    Sweetie Belle So, we did the whole competition... together? 
    Rarity That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line. 
    Apple Bloom But you finished together! 
    Sweetie Belle You mean... you were all in on it? 
    Applejack, Apple Bloom and Rarity Mm-hmm. 
    Sweetie Belle You did this for me? 
    Rarity Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie! 
    Sweetie Belle Huh? 
    Rarity Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration! 
    Applejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Sweetie Belle Where? 
    Rarity The spa, of course. 
    Applejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  
    Sweetie Belle Oh, Rarity. 
    Rarity No, I-I-I'm serious. 

    Rarity Very well then, what should we write to the Princess? 
    Sweetie Belle I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest. 
    Rarity I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty. 
    Sweetie Belle A lot dirty. 
    Rarity A little bit dirty. 
    Sweetie Belle A lot dirty. 
    Rarity A little bit dirty! 
    Sweetie Belle A loâ€“ 
    Spike Hold it, hold it! How about "a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right"? 
    Rarity and Sweetie Belle Deal! 
     

     
     

The Cutie Pox

    Apple Bloom Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'! 
    Scootaloo Whoo-hoo! 
    Sweetie Belle  I mean, yaay! 
    Apple Bloom Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes! 
    Scootaloo That makes us sound like we've struck out. 
    Apple Bloom Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins? 
    Sweetie Belle But there are three of us. 
    Apple Bloom Okay then... Um... the Bowlin' Dolls! 
    Sweetie Belle The Bowling Dolls! That's it! 
    Scootaloo Perfect! 
    Apple Bloom All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over! 

    Scootaloo  
    Apple Bloom Phpoo! 
     
    Sea Swirl Cool! A bowling cutie mark! 
    Apple Bloom I did it! I did it! Blank? 
     
    Apple Bloom But... but... what about my ball? 

     

    Sweetie Belle That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane. I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again! Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
    Scootaloo Aw, come on, Apple Bloom. 
    Sweetie Belle I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple. 

    Sweetie Belle A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up. 
    Apple Bloom No, it won't. 

     
    Pinkie Pie A party will cheer you up! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
     
    Apple Bloom No, it won't. 
     
     

    Rarity A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up. 
    Apple Bloom No, it won't. 

    Scootaloo Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark! 
    Sweetie Belle Or lack of a cutie mark! 
    Scootaloo Shh! That's not helping! Apple Bloom! Where are you going?! Apple Bloom, come back! 

    Apple Bloom Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn... 
    Zecora Well, who is it that we have here? Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear! 
    Apple Bloom Ow... 
    Zecora What has happened to you, youth? Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth. Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick. 

    Apple Bloom  I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank! 
    Zecora Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good. 
    Apple Bloom  Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now! 
     
    Zecora For your cutie mark, you will have to wait. We must fix that tooth before it's too late. Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top! 
    Apple Bloom  Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath... 
    Zecora Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew. 
    Apple Bloom And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything. 
    Zecora There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy. 
    Apple Bloom Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there? 
    Zecora I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks.  making mornings very slow. 
    Apple Bloom Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it? 
    Zecora It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo! 
    Apple Bloom Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh? 
    Zecora Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power! 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, you go, you go. 

     
    Sweetie Belle I'm so hungry. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, I can't wai-- 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Aah! Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark! 

    Sweetie Belle Um, Apple Bloom... what is it? 
    Scootaloo Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling? 
    Sweetie Belle Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker? 
    Twist Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious. 
    Apple Bloom No, it's a loop-de-hoop! 
    Scootaloo  A what now? 
    Apple Bloom A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent? 
    Sweetie Belle Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing! 
    Diamond Tiara That's it? That's your talent? 
    Silver Spoon Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet. 
     
    Scootaloo Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper! 
    Apple Bloom Thanks, everypony! 
     
    Cheerilee All right, my little ponies, time for class! 
     
    Cheerilee Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom Yes, Miss Cheerilee? 
    Cheerilee I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping! 
     

    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Apple Bloom Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Grr... 
    Apple Bloom Great job, girls! 
    Sweetie Belle You're too kind, Apple Bloom. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, we stink. 
    Apple Bloom Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop!  And hoop and flip! 
     
    Cheerilee  Show us some more, Apple Bloom. 
    Apple Bloom Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara? 
    Diamond Tiara  
    Apple Bloom I call this one the hoop-la!  Huh? Oof! 
    Diamond Tiara Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake! 
    Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle and Twist  
    Apple Bloom What? No they're not! 
    Diamond Tiara Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks? 
    Cheerilee I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents! 
    Silver Spoon Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that! 
    Snips Spin plates! 
    Snails Yeah! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Two cutie marks? 
    Scootaloo Two talents? 
    Apple Bloom Aw yeah! 
    Sweetie Belle Our friend is the most... 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle ...special pony ever! 
    Apple Bloom Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show? 

     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  
     

    Applejack Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Nnnope. 
    Granny Smith Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better. 
    Applejack Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now! 
    Apple Bloom Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night! 
    Applejack Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 

     
    Applejack  Three cutie marks?! 
    Apple Bloom Help me! 

    Apple Bloom Help me! 
    Applejack C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa! 
    Apple Bloom I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop! 
    Applejack Well, I know somepony who might! 

    Twilight Sparkle Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it? 
    Spike "Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, Spike, you're amazing! 
    Spike Yes, well, I do have some talents. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hay fever... the trots...  Cutie pox! 
    Apple Bloom, Applejack and Spike Cutie pox?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period! 
    Spike Heh, say that ten times fast! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them! 
    Apple Bloom Just like me! 
    Applejack Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?! 
    Twilight Sparkle It says here there's no known cure! 
    Apple Bloom, Applejack and Spike No known cure?! 
    Twilight Sparkle The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived! 
    Apple Bloom Oh no! Sacrebleu! Plus de marques de cutie!  What's this?! I speak French?!) 
    Applejack My sister's speakin' in fancy! 
    Twilight Sparkle She needs help! 
    Applejack I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast! 
    Apple Bloom Tout de suite! (Now!) 
    Twilight Sparkle Not some pony... some zebra! 
    Applejack Zecora! 

    Applejack Hurry, hurry! 
    Apple Bloom DÃ©pÃªchez-vous! (Hurry!) 
     
     
     
    Lily Valley She's cursed! 
    Rose Hexed! 
    Daisy Enchanted! 
    Spike No, she's not. 
    Daisy, Lily Valley and Rose  
    Spike She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox. 
    Everypony Cutie pox?!  
     
    Pony She's got the cutie pox! 
     
    Zecora I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut. 
    Twilight Sparkle Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure! 
    Applejack But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'? 
    Zecora My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away? 
    Apple Bloom I, um... 
    Zecora A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth. 
    Applejack Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick! 
    Zecora These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found. 
    Applejack Come again? 
    Zecora The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth! 
    Apple Bloom Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
    Applejack Somepony! Anypony! 
    Pinkie Pie Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes!  Make it stop! Oh, make it stop! 
    Apple Bloom Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it! 
     
    Apple Bloom  Ahh. 
    Sweetie Belle Apple Bloom! 
    Scootaloo Are you okay? 
    Apple Bloom I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again. 
    Zecora Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned? 
    Apple Bloom I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike? 
    Spike Ready! 

    Apple Bloom Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires. 
    Applejack I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience. 
    Apple Bloom Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough. 
    Scootaloo Actually, that was way too long. 
    Applejack What?! 
    Apple Bloom So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks? 
    Scootaloo Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce. 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making? 
    Apple Bloom Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now! 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Scootaloo Woo-hoo! 

     
     

May the Best Pet Win!

    Rainbow Dash Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!  Whoa! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Rainbow Dash Who? Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious. C'mon, try and keep up!  
    Winona  
    Rainbow Dash Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town. 
    Opalescence  
    Rainbow Dash  Yaaaaah! 

    Rainbow Dash Whaa! 
    Opalescence  
    Winona  
    Owlowiscious  
    Rainbow Dash Phew. 

     

    Winona  
     
    Applejack Let's get this thing started! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Say you're sorry, Opal. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity She's... sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash What are you all doing out here? 
    Applejack Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, you do? 
    Applejack Same time every week. 
    Fluttershy I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, exceptâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this. 
    Fluttershy Oh, please don't be mad at us. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right? 
    Applejack Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet! 
    Fluttershy Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house! Oh, and I know you'll just love them! And they'll love you! Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh! 

    

        Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight 
        It's abundantly clear 
        That somewhere out here 
        Is the pet that will suit you just right 

    

        I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules 
        It's of utmost importance 
        The pet that I get 
        Is something that's awesome and cool 

    Fluttershy Awesome, cool, got it!

        I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see 

    

        I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me 

    

        Sure! How 'bout a bunny? 
        They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be 

    

        Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me? 

    

        Rainbow, have faith 
        You see, I will bet you 
        Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you 

    Fluttershy Come on, the sky's the limit! 
    Rainbow Dash Sky is good. I'd like it to fly. 
    Fluttershy Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you! 
    Rainbow Dash Pass. 

    

        I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide 
        There are otters and seals 
        With massive appeal 

    Rainbow Dash Otters and seals do not fly. 
    Fluttershy Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water! 
     
    Rainbow Dash That's it. I'm outta here. 

    

        Wait! There must be a pet here 
        That will fit the ticket 
        How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket? 

    Rainbow Dash Bigger. And cooler. 
    Fluttershy Bigger, cooler. Right. 

        I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash 
        Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely! 

    Rainbow Dash It's just a squirrel. 
    Fluttershy Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel! 
    Rainbow Dash ...Yeah. So, like I was saying... 

        Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it 
        I need a pet to keep up with me 
        Something awesome, something flying 
        With coolness that defies gravity! 

    Fluttershy I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly. 
    Rainbow Dash Ya think? 

    

        I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky 
        Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly 

    Rainbow Dash Better, but cooler. 

    

        I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan? 
        There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that 
        There are falcons and eagles 
        They are both quite regal 
        Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat? 

    Rainbow Dash Now you're talking! But instead of just one standout, now that's too many. 

        So many choices, and such riches aplenty 

    Fluttershy Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me. 

    

        The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too 
        Do you have something in a yellow striped bat? 

    Fluttershy No. 

        I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you 

    

        What to do, what to do?  
        A prize! That's it! There's really just one way 
        To find out which animal's best 
        Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts 
        That will put each pet to the test 

    

        Don't forget style, that should be considered 

    

        Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter 

    

        The one who is awesome as cool 

    

        Just like me 
        Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best 

    

        So a contest we will see 

    

        Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet 

    

        In the world for me! 

    

        May the games 

    

        Begin! 

    Rainbow Dash And may the best pet win! 

    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash  So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions? 
    Applejack I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, like care and attention, love and affectionâ€“ Ugh! And breath mints! 
    Fluttershy Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, andâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for? 
    Fluttershy Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here. 
    Rainbow Dash No. 
    Fluttershy Oh, just let him try. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him! 
    Fluttershy It won't hurt to let him try. 
    Rainbow Dash Butâ€“ 
    Fluttershy Just let him try? 
    Rainbow Dash Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness. 
    Twilight Sparkle Aren't those all the same thing? 
    Rainbow Dash You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet. 

    Rainbow Dash Speed! On your marks... 
    Duck  
    Rainbow Dash Get set...  Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy... 
    Falcon  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! That's speed! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Tsk-tsk. That's just sad. 

    Rainbow Dash Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile...  Wanna know the opposite of agility? That. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility!  Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that. 

    Rainbow Dash Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her? 
    Opalescence  
     
    Rainbow Dash Now that takes guts! 
    Opalescence  

    Rainbow Dash Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good! 

    Rainbow Dash Coolness! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Sorta cool. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Not cool. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Pretty cool. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Could be cooler. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Eugh. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Now that's a cool sound! 

    Rainbow Dash  Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh? 

     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off. 

    Rainbow Dash  Listen, turtle... 
    Fluttershy Tortoise. 
    Rainbow Dash Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't. 
     
    Rainbow Dash You didn't. 
     
    Rainbow Dash I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Gesundheit. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo! 
    Rainbow Dash Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up! 
    Rainbow Dash Can't catch me, ha-ha! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right, guys? 
     
    Rainbow Dash AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa! 
    Rainbow Dash C'mon... No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me! 

    Rainbow Dash Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyouthaâ€“ You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you! 

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hm, something's not right here. 
    Fluttershy Where's Rainbow Dash? 
    Applejack Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there! 
    Spike Rainbow! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Look! 
    Fluttershy It's the turtle! 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle Tortoise! 
    Fluttershy Oh, whatever... 
    Twilight Sparkle And he's carrying something on his back... 
    Pinkie Pie Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow! 
     
     
    Fluttershy Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway. 
     
    Spike Huh. Way to go, little guy! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow! 
    Rainbow Dash Just my pride. 
    Rarity I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it!  
    Applejack It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one. 
    Fluttershy Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh... Right... Yeah... That. 
    Spike What's the matter? 
    Pinkie Pie You got your perfect pet, right? 
    Fluttershy The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again? 
    Applejack A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does looks cool... He's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet.  
    Fluttershy Yay? 
    Rainbow Dash But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet. 
    Pinkie Pie You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule! 
    Rainbow Dash And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle But what about theâ€“ 
    Applejack Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow. 
    Everypony  
    Rainbow Dash Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was. 
    Opalescence  
    Rainbow Dash Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Tenacity. 
    Rainbow Dash Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank! 
    Fluttershy But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember? 
    Rainbow Dash Hmm... 

     
    Rainbow Dash Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate! 

     
     

The Mysterious Mare Do Well

     
    Scootaloo Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville. 
    Snails I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash. 
     
    Snips I object! 
     
    Snips I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony! 
    Scootaloo 'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic! 
    Snips Astonishing! 
    Scootaloo Breathtaking! 
    Snips Astounding! 
    Scootaloo Bedazzling! 
    Rainbow Dash What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing? 
     
    Scootaloo All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'! 
    Fan club Aye!  
    Rainbow Dash  

     

    Rainbow Dash  What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed. 
    Aura Help! Help! Help! Help! 
    Rainbow Dash Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal. 
    Aura To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash! 
     
    Scootaloo That Rainbow Dash sure is something. 
    Snips and Snails Something special. 

    "Millie"  
    Cream Puff  
     
    Rainbow Dash  Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby! 
     
    Rainbow Dash She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash! 
     
     
    Scootaloo There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can think of a few new words. 
    Applejack And I bet 'modest' is not one of them. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle No, but she is kinda awesome. 

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here! 
     
     
    Pony 1 We'd be lost without you! 
    Pony 2 You're our hero, Rainbow Dash! 
    Crowd Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash I can't hear you! 
    Crowd Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! 
    Twilight Sparkle Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head. 
    Pinkie Pie You may be right...silly. 

    Rainbow Dash And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day. 
    Spike That day. 
    Applejack Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since. 
    Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle Mm-hm. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend? 
    Applejack Immorta-what? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Are you taking notes? 
    Spike Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography! 
    Twilight Sparkle Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about. 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer. 
    Pinkie Pie  Spike's a ghost! 
    Rainbow Dash ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike? 
    Spike Don't... you... Spike. Got it! 
    Rainbow Dash This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge. 

    Rainbow Dash  There you go. 
    "Lemon Daze" Someday, I wanna be just like you! 
    Rainbow Dash Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible. 
    Cherry Berry  
     
    Cherry Berry Help! Help! 
    Snips Uh, don't you think you should go and help? 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more. 
    Spike The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time? 
     
    Pony Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere! 
    Daisy I've never seen such bravery in all my life! 
    Mayor Mare That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me! 

     
    Rainbow Dash  Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbowâ€“ 
    Globe Trotter Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah! 
     
    "Wisp" Oh, thank you, Mare Do Weâ€“ e... 
    Rainbow Dash I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way. 

     
    Crafty Crate Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighborâ€“ Whoa! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Never fearâ€“ Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa! 
    Jack Hammer Look! 
    Crafty Crate  
    "Jim Beam" Look out for theâ€“ Watch out for fallingâ€“ On your left! Agh! Your other left! 
    Rainbow Dash Here ya go, safe and sound. 
     
    "Jim Beam"  
    Rainbow Dash Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning. 
    "Rivet" Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game. 

     
    Rainbow Dash  If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy. 
     
    Rainbow Dash My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myselfâ€“  Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thankâ€“ You gotta be kidding me... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, for the love of Pete. 

    Applejack Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats. 
    Twilight Sparkle I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy She really cares about everypony's safety. 
    Rarity Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion. 
    Applejack And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that. 
    Rainbow Dash I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great! 
    Spike She's... great. 
    Rainbow Dash I didn't say that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds like somepony's jealous. 
    Rainbow Dash Who, me? 
    Spike Rainbow Dash is jealous. 
    Rainbow Dash Don't write that, Spike! 
     
    Spike Correction Rainbow Dash is very jealous. 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as goodâ€“ no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well! 

    Rainbow Dash Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it. 
    Rainbow Dash Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?! 
    Rainbow Dash Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?  Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here. 
    Granny Smith Eh, what's that? 
    Rainbow Dash You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street! 
    Granny Smith  Actually, I can cross the street just fine! 
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves! 
    Granny Smith  Back off! 
    Rainbow Dash  Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think? 
    Granny Smith I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place!  
    Amethyst Star  
    Rainbow Dash  Somepony's in trouble! 
    Amethyst Star  
    Rainbow Dash You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back! 
    Amethyst Star Oh, brother. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash Ta-da! 
    Amethyst Star Uh... thanks. 
    Rainbow Dash How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing? 
    Amethyst Star Aren't you milking this a bit? 
    Rainbow Dash Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing? 
    Amethyst Star Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazinglyâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, look! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass! 
    "Pine Breeze" From what? 
    Rainbow Dash From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn! 
    Liza Doolots Lame... 
    Pony Whatever. 
    Rainbow Dash Aww, who am I kidding? 

     
    Rainbow Dash All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone. 
    Scootaloo Hey, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake. 
    Scootaloo Mistake? What mistake? 
    Rainbow Dash Wait a minute. Why are you here? 
    Scootaloo To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well. 
    Rainbow Dash No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone. 
    Scootaloo Oh, okay. See you later then. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.  Hey, squirt! Wait up! 

    Mayor Mare Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well! 
     
    Rainbow Dash The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh? 
     
    Rainbow Dash So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask! 
    Mare Do Well  
    Rainbow Dash What the hay? 
    Mare Do Well  
    Rainbow Dash Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved!  P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times. 
    Applejack I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee. 
    Pinkie Pie I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense.  
     
    Cherry Berry Sorry! 
    Pinkie Pie It's alright. 
    Twilight Sparkle And I used my magic to fix the dam. 
    Fluttershy Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards. 
    Rarity I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself! 
    Rainbow Dash I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course we want you to be a hero. 
    Applejack But a real hero doesn't brag. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little. 
    Other main cast A little?! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, a lot. 
    Twilight Sparkle Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But... 
    Applejack ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake.  
    Applejack I think we're getting off topic here. 
    Twilight Sparkle What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility. 
    Rainbow Dash Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia. 
    Spike Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess. 
    Rainbow Dash That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself. 
    Spike Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, let's hear it. 
    Spike  Dear Princess Cel- 
    Rainbow Dash Look out! It's a real ghost! 
    Pinkie Pie and Spike  
    Others  

     
     

Sweet and Elite

    Rarity  Here? I get to stay here? 
    Princess Celestia Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Thank you so much, Princess. 
    Princess Celestia You're very welcome. 
    Rarity No, really. This is so nice of you. 
    Princess Celestia It's nothing, really. 
    Rarity Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you!  
    Princess Celestia You are very weâ€“ 
    Rarity Thank you! 
    Bags Valet  Your luggage, mademoiselle? 
    Princess Celestia I'll leave you to get settled. 
    Bags Valet Your highness. 
    Princess Celestia Enjoy your stay. 
    Rarity Thank you! 
    Bags Valet  Where would you like me to put these? 
    Rarity That's perfect. 

     

    Rarity Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot?  Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle, I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence? 
    Jet Set Please excuse our interruption. I'm Jet Set, and this is my wife Upper Crust. We saw you from across the cafe and just had to find out... 
    Upper Crust ...Where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau? 
    Rarity Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something Iâ€“ 
    Hayseed Turnip Truck Rarity! Hey, Rarity! Whoo! It's me, Hayseed Turnip Truck! We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last month? 
    Rarity Oh, yes, of course... how are you? 
    Hayseed Turnip Truck Good! Real good! 
     
    Jet Set and Upper Crust Hmm... 
    Jet Set You're from... Ponyville? 
    Rarity Well, yeah, yes, butâ€“ 
    Hayseed Turnip Truck She sure is! She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there! Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head! 
    Upper Crust I thought it looked a little country. 
    Jet Set I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear. 
    Jet Set and Upper Crust Hmph! 
    Hayseed Turnip Truck Well, they seemed real nice. 
    Rarity  

    Rarity "Looked a little country". "Not something you can get in Canterlot". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot! 

    Rarity  Fancy Pants! 
    Fancy Pants I say, that's one way to make an introduction. 
    Rarity Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle andâ€“ 
    Fancy Pants You're staying at the castle? 
    Rarity Whâ€“ The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites. 
    Fancy Pants You know the Princess? 
    Fleur Dis Lee Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see. 
    Rarity Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days.  Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you. 
    Fancy Pants I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there? 
    Rarity Me? 
    Fancy Pants But of course, my dear. 
    Rarity Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure. 
    Fancy Pants We'd love to see you there, uh...? 
    Rarity Rarity. 
    Fancy Pants Rarity. 

    Rarity Pro Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants!  

    Rarity Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me! 
    Fancy Pants Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it. 
     
    Fancy Pants Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle. 
    Ponies  
    Announcer Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby! The competitors are taking their places at the starting line, and the race will begin momentarily! 
    Fancy Pants I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize. 
     
    Rarity I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot. 
     
     
     
    Announcer And it's Fleetfoot by a nose! 
    Rarity  
    Fancy Pants Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious? 
    Rarity My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed. 
    Silver Frames And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'? 
    Rarity Uh...  Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course. 
    Fancy Pants Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony. 
     
    Fancy Pants Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest! 
    Ponies Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! 

    Rarity ...And then I said, "Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!" 
     
    Silver Frames Oh, you are a delight, Rarity, an absolute delight. You simply must attend my art gallery opening this evening.  
    Rarity Oh, I'd love to, but Iâ€“ 
    Golden Gavel And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning. 
    Rarity Well, that sounds wonderful, but Iâ€“ 
    Swan Song And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night. 
    Rarity I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and- 
    Silver Frames Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend! 
    Golden Gavel My auction is for charity, dear. For charity... 
    Swan Song And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come. 
    Rarity ...of course I'll be there. 
    Silver Frames Wonderful! 
    Golden Gavel Oh, thank goodness! 
    Swan Song Disaster averted! 

    Rarity Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I? 

    

        I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go 
        I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know 
        I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow 
        I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know 

        Becoming as popular as popular can be 
        Making my mark, making my mark in high society 
        I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah 
        I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know 

        See how they hang on every word that I speak 
        My approving glance is what they all seek 
        I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe 
        I'm the type of pony every pony should know 

        At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht 
        Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot 
        I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah 
        I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know 

        Because I'm the type of pony 
        Yes, I'm the type of pony 
        Yes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know 

    Rarity Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything. 
    Bags Valet Me... too... 
    Rarity We'd better get going. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble. 
     
    Rarity For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust!  My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity. 
    Bags Valet I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags? 
    Rarity No. But, I will need some help unpacking them. 
    Bags Valet Oomph! 
    Opalescence  

    Rarity What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come! 
    Rest of main cast Surprise! 
    Rarity  

    Pinkie Pie  Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, sheâ€“ Hi again! 
    Rarity What are youâ€“ how did youâ€“ Why are youâ€“ 
    Applejack Listen to her. She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk. 
    Rarity What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it! 
    Pinkie Pie Balloons are super easy to pack. 
     
    Rarity Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight. 
    Rainbow Dash How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup? 
    Rarity This? Uh- well, I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up.  
    Fluttershy Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling? 
    Rarity Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute. 
     
    Rest of main cast Huh? 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity I am so sorry about this. 
     
    Opalescence  
    Rarity She's resting on the bed. 
    Fluttershy Poor baby. 
    Opalescence  
    Fluttershy She looks awful. 
    Opalescence  
    Twilight Sparkle Is... that my dress? 
    Rarity Yes. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it! 
    Rarity  You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that. 

    Twilight Sparkle When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot castle ballroom! 
    Pinkie Pie Isn't it fancy pants? 
    Rarity Fancy Pants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Ha-ha.  
    Pinkie Pie Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Ta-da! 
    Twilight Sparkle I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Let's party! 
     

    Rarity Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance... 

     
    Rarity I'm here! 
    Upper Crust Darling, I'm so glad you made it. 
    Fancy Pants Rarity! So happy to see you here. 
    Rarity I wouldn't have missed this for the world. 
    Fancy Pants  Is that cake frosting? 
    Rarity ...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out.  After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting? 
    Fancy Pants I know I do. 
    Upper Crust Mm-hmm. 
    Rarity  Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me... 
    Fancy Pants and Upper Crust  

    Fancy Pants and Upper Crust  

    Rarity  

    Rarity I think I left the bathwater running in my suite. 

    Rarity I really should go check on Opal... 

    Rarity Is that Princess Celestia? 

    Rarity  I need to use the little fillies' room! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Rarity Can I get anypony more punch? 

    Rarity I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...?  

    Rainbow Dash Uh, what's with the croquet mallet? 
    Rarity  What croquet mallet? 
    Rainbow Dash Duh, the one in your mouth! 
    Rarity  Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is... 
    Twilight Sparkle Were you at that other party in the garden? 
    Rarity I, I... 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, I'm surprised at you. 
    Rarity Twilight let me explain! Iâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony! 
    Rarity You must understand! Iâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart! 
    Rarity Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason.  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, well, you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle! 
    Rarity Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand. 
    Twilight Sparkle Understand what? 
    Rarity Nothing. See you girls later! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style! 
    Rarity Oh no! 

     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Mmm! 
    Applejack How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it? 
    Rarity  
    Jet Set Can you believe what that pony is wearing? 
    Upper Crust It's just so plain. 
    Rarity  Yeah. 
    Fancy Pants Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble? 
    Twilight Sparkle Why, yes! Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me. 
    Rarity  
    Fancy Pants Ponyville? You don't say? 
    Twilight Sparkle I do say. Her name isâ€“ 
    Rarity Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room. 
    Fancy Pants In a moment, my dear. This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress. 
    Rarity That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain oldâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle We all think so! 
    Fancy Pants  You know these ponies? 
     
    Rarity Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know. 
    Jet Set Important ponies? These ruffians? 
    Upper Crust Don't make me laugh! 
    Jet Set and Upper Crust  
    Fancy Pants I, for one, find them charmingly rustic. 
     
    Fancy Pants And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely.  I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one. 
    Upper Crust Oh, I'd like to place my order right now. 
    Jet Set I think you should get two. 
    Fancy Pants Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends? 
    Rarity With pleasure! 

    Rarity Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit. 
    Princess Celestia Now that I would like to hear. 
    Rarity I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what. 
    Princess Celestia Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned. 
    Bags Valet It certainly is! But... might I ask that we hurry things up a bit?! Oh no! 

     
     

Secret of My Excess

    Twilight Sparkle No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day! Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... Actually, I kinda wanna read that again. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! What are you laughing at? 
    Spike This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe! 
     
    Spike  Hey, you took my advice! Just use the whole floor as one big shelf. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Rarity  Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets... 
    Spike And totally delicious. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhh... if you guys don't mind? 
    Rarity Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion...  Did you say... delicious? 
    Spike Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner. 
    Twilight Sparkle Start with this one. 
    Rarity Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game...  I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before. 
    Spike Gosh... You really like it, huh? 
    Rarity Like it? It's magnificent. 
    Spike  Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you. 
    Rarity I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!  Thank you so much! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy! 
    Spike I will never wash this cheek again.  

    Twilight Sparkle Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon. 
    Spike There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect! 
    Twilight Sparkle Not quite everything. 
    Spike A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight! I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek! 
    Spike  It's mine! Stop it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Never! 
    Spike Twilight...! 
    Pinkie Pie  Happy birthday! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Party time, woo-hoo! 
    Spike Are those... for me? 
    Applejack You bet they are, birthday boy. 
    Fluttershy Happy birthday, Spike. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Don't you know you get presents on your birthday? 
    Spike Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book. 
     
    Rarity Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Rarity I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm. 

    Spike Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one. 
    Applejack C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed. 
    Spike I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday! 
    Spike No way! 
    Pinkie Pie I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now! 
     

    Spike Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake! 
    Mr. Cake There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike! 
    Spike Thanks! 
    Mrs. Cake When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe sapphire! 
    Spike Wow! 

    Spike Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee! 
    Cheerilee That's okay. What's got you so excited? 
    Spike  Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today. 
    Cheerilee Well, happy birthday, Spike! I wish I had something to give you! Uh... Oh! Here you go! 
    Spike Wow, really? 
    Cheerilee Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday! Have a great birthday, Spike. 
    Spike I wish every day was my birthday... 

    Spike Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat. 
     
    Spike Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday? 

     
    Spike  Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday! 
    Junebug Happy birthday, Spike. 
    Spike Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present? 
    Junebug Um, I... I don't have anything. 
    Spike Well, how about those flowers? I'll take thoseâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away. 
    Junebug Uh, no problem... H-Happy birthday, Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now? 
    Spike Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back. 
    Twilight Sparkle No problem. See you at home later? 
    Spike Sounds good! Bye!  

    Twilight Sparkle Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest dreaâ€“ 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe you! Where'd you get all thisâ€“  
     
    Spike  What happened? 

    Spike What's happening to me, Twilight?! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you? 
    Spike I went to talk... to... 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle You went to talk to who? 
    Spike Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
     
    Spike What about this book? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby! 
    Spike My arms aren't usually  this long either. What's happening to me? 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Doc Top Well now, what seems to be the problem? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is Spike.  his! 
    Doc Top All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we? Widdle guy not feewing too good? Who's a brave widdle boy, huh? Who's a brave one? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So? What do you think, Doctor? 
    Doc Top Well, I think I know what the problem is. He's a dragon! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon. 
    Doc Top Oh. Well, that would explain it. Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies. Maybe you should try a vet. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay. Thank you, doctor. 

    Mane Goodall Hm, well, I'm flummoxed. Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds. Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before. 
    Spike  
    Mane Goodall Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike. 

     
     
    Spike  
    Zecora Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things. 
    Zecora A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur â€“ he is going to turn into a monster. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control? 
    Zecora If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Apple Bloom Get away from her, you brute! 
    Spike Spike want! 
    Scootaloo You're not getting my scooter! 
    Spike Spike want! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom! 
    Spike Spike want!  
    Twilight Sparkle  C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom! 
    Spike Spike want! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  What now? 

    Applejack Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves? 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him! 
    Applejack  Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh. 
    Spike  
    Applejack Twilight, get my rope. 
    Spike  
    Applejack and Twilight Sparkle Help! 
    Rainbow Dash Huh?  Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up? 
    Applejack Get us out of here right now! 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack  What was that? 
    Rainbow Dash Sounded like Fluttershy to me! 

    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy? Fluttershy!? 
    Fluttershy I'm up here! 
    Twilight Sparkle What happened? 
    Fluttershy I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through! 
    Twilight Sparkle That was Spike! 
    Fluttershy Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash That sounded like Pinkie Pie! 
    Twilight Sparkle C'mon, girls! 

    Pinkie Pie Back! Get back! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake! 
    Pinkie Pie I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie How dare you take the cake! 
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next! 

    Rarity  

     
     
    Spike  
    Rarity  
    Spike  
     
     
    Rarity Put me down, you brute! 
    Spike  
    Rarity How rude. 
    Fluttershy Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you! 
    Rainbow Dash Put her down, right now! 
    Fluttershy I-If you wouldn't mind, that is... 
    Rainbow Dash I mean it, dragon boy! 
    Fluttershy We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider... 
    Rainbow Dash Drop her, scaly! 
    Rarity Hey! I'mâ€“ not someâ€“ sort of commonâ€“ fly swatter! 
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rarity Girls! My cape! 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Look! The Wonderbolts! 
    Spike  
    Rarity  
    Spike  
    Rarity Oh, be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this!  This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you! 
    Spike  

    Spike (flashback) Here, Rarity, you take it. It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself. 
    Rarity (flashback) I... I don't know what to say. This is just so generous.  

    Rarity Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?! 
    Rarity and Spike  
    Pinkie Pie Somepony do something! 
    Rainbow Dash On it! 
     
    Spike Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crushâ€“ 
    Fluttershy  We did it! I can't believe we did it! 
     
    Rainbow Dash All in a day's work. 
    Rarity Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you. 
    Spike Proud of me? 
    Rarity Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey!  

    Spike Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything. 
     

     
     

Hearth's Warming Eve

     
    Twilight Sparkle We're getting closer! 
    Rainbow Dash I can hardly wait! 
    Fluttershy I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting!  Woo-hoo! 
    Applejack Hooo-wee! Canterlot, here we come! 
    Rarity Oh, I do hope I look festive enough! 
    Pinkie Pie There it is! Canterlot! 
    Main cast Oooh... 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day. 
    Applejack There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head! 
    Twilight Sparkle I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane. 
    Rainbow Dash I spy a snowpony! 
    Pinkie Pie I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house... 
     
    Pinkie Pie  ...and it's me! 
    Main cast  

     

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us? 
    Fluttershy Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me! 
    Rarity Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about. 
    Fluttershy No? 
    Rarity Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition. 
    Fluttershy So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play? 
    Rarity Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us. 
    Fluttershy A lot? 
    Rarity Hundreds. 
    Fluttershy Hundreds? 
    Rarity  Maybe even thousands! 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Rarity Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you? 
    Rainbow Dash Aaah! Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you! 
    Applejack It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'. 
    Rainbow Dash Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there! 
    Spike Curtain in two minutes! 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, let me handle this. 
    Rarity My hair! 
    Twilight Sparkle PINKIE! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship. 
    Other main cast Shut the window! 
    Spike  

     
    Spike  Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred! 
    Audience  
    Spike  During this frightful age, each of the three tribes â€“ the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies â€“ cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return. Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies. 
    Audience  
    Spike The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace. 

    Spike The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land. 
     
    Spike The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard. 

    Spike Each tribe sent their leaders. 
     
    Spike Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum. 
     
    Spike Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly... 
     
    Spike ...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster. 
    Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food! 
    Pegasi  
    Pinkie Pie Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh, wait. You're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy! 
    Rainbow Dash For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic! 
    Rarity  How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph! 
    Unicorns Hmph! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas. 
    Rainbow Dash What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas. 
    Rarity Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults! 
    Rainbow Dash You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness! 
    Rarity I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I'm leaving first! 
    Pinkie Pie No, I'm first! 
    Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Spike And the blizzard raged on. 
     

    Spike So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain. 

    Rainbow Dash Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went? 
    Fluttershy Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir? 
    Rainbow Dash Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals! 
     

    Rarity  Clover the Clever! I need you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, your Majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted? 
    Rarity Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them! 

    Applejack Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor? 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means  I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney? 
    Applejack Uh... 
    Pinkie Pie I didn't think so. 
    Applejack Ugh. 
    Pinkie Pie Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves! I am just about to be brilliant! 
    Applejack  That'd be a first. 
    Pinkie Pie I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone! 
    Applejack Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if weâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right? 
    Applejack Actually, we're all out. 
    Pinkie Pie Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong? 
     
    Applejack  Where should I start? 
    Pinkie Pie The point is... 
    Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity We must find a new land! 

    Rainbow Dash C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land! 
    Fluttershy Conquer, sir? 
    Rainbow Dash You never know where enemies might be lurking. 
    Fluttershy I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow. 
    Rainbow Dash A-ha! What's that?!  
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Okay. This is getting old. 

    Rarity Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for? 
    Twilight Sparkle About five minutes, your highness. 
    Rarity Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree? 
    Twilight Sparkle I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder. 
    Rarity Stoooooop! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's wrong? 
    Rarity That is what's wrong! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Your Highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily. 
    Rarity I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library. 

    Pinkie Pie Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction. 
    Applejack It feels like we're going in circles. 
    Pinkie Pie But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong? 
    Applejack Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, andâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Of course! How else could I see where I was going? 
    Applejack Yeah, uhâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up? 
    Applejack Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship. Heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down. 
    Pinkie Pie I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down. 
    Applejack You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map... 
    Pinkie Pie Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here, it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh... 
    Applejack Secretary. 
    Pinkie Pie Whatever. You take the map, while I enjoy some relief. 
    Applejack Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead. 

    Spike  And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before. 

    Rainbow Dash This is the new land we've been searching for! 
    Fluttershy What a view... I can see my future house from here. 
    Rainbow Dash I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis! 

    Rarity I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled!  In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia! 

    Pinkie Pie The air! The trees! The dirt! This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world! 
    Applejack And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food. 
    Pinkie Pie In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville. 
    Applejack How about "Earth"? 
    Pinkie Pie Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it. 

    Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity We found our new home! 
    Rainbow Dash I planted my flag first! 
    Rarity Did not! 
    Rainbow Dash Did too! 
    Pinkie Pie I planted mine earlier than first. 
    Rarity All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia! 
    Rainbow Dash The name is Pegasopolis! 
    Pinkie Pie Earth! 
    Rainbow Dash Pegasopolis! 
    Rarity Unicornia! 
    Rainbow Dash I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win! 
     
    Rarity That's barbaric. Clover the Clever? Throw that brute into the dungeon! 
    Twilight Sparkle What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down... 
    Applejack I agree. Let's all calm down. 
    Fluttershy I vote for calm. 
    Rainbow Dash I'll have you court-martialed for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield! 
     
    Rarity  
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh no. Not again. 
     
     

    Spike  And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead ofâ€“ 
    Shoeshine We get it! Move on! 
    Spike  Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that. 

    Rarity Please, Commander Hothead. 
    Rainbow Dash It's Commander Hurricane. 
    Rarity  Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space? 
    Rainbow Dash You mean like this, your highness? 
    Rarity Indeed not! You see this invisible line? 
    Rainbow Dash Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis! 
    Rarity Clover the Clever? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh... Smart Cookie! 
    Applejack I know, I know. 
    Rainbow Dash What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy! 
    Rarity That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us!  Who knows? there could be jewels inside. 
    Rainbow Dash  I claim this rock for Pegasopolis! 
    Rarity Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey! You invaded our territory! 
    Pinkie Pie Finders keepers, losers weepers! 
    Rainbow Dash That's the last straw! 
    Rarity Give me my rock! 
    Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Look, everypony! The entrance! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped! 
    Rarity You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other! 
    Rainbow Dash You've been fighting too, your Highness. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you! 
     
    Rarity How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting! 
    Rainbow Dash That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls! 
    Rarity Pegasi are brutes! 
    Pinkie Pie Unicorns are snobs! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Applejack, Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy W-W-What is that... thing? 
    Twilight Sparkle They must be... windigos! 
    Applejack and Fluttershy Windigos? 
    Twilight Sparkle My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become! 
    Applejack Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too. 
    Twilight Sparkle And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate. 
    Fluttershy Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys. 
    Applejack and Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Fluttershy Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her. 
    Applejack and Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack Well, I don't hate you guys either. 
    Twilight Sparkle Nor do I. 
     
    Applejack No matter what our differences, we're all ponies. 
     
     
    Fluttershy What was that? 
    Applejack I didn't know unicorns could do that. 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship. 
    Spike  And it even began to melt their hearts. 
     

    Spike  The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land... 
    Main cast Equestria! 
    Audience  

    

        The fire of friendship lives in our hearts 
        As long as it burns, we cannot drift apart 
        Though quarrels arise, their numbers are few 
        Laughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)

    Twilight Sparkle We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are! 
     
    Rarity Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows. 
    Applejack Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings. 
    Rainbow Dash Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!

    Granny Smith 'Course, Filthy. 
    Filthy Rich Uh, I prefer Rich. 
    Granny Smith Oh, and how is your pappy doin'?

    Apple Bloom Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years! 
    Diamond Tiara I'm not talking about the jam. I'm talking about Granny Smith! You must be sooo embarrassed. 
    Granny Smith  Soup's on! 
    Apple Bloom Uh, what do ya mean? 
    Diamond Tiara You know, with all her silly ways, how she forgets things, and makes you wear these ridiculous costumes? 
    Apple Bloom Granny said that the water needsâ€“ 
    Diamond Tiara Thank goodness you're here on the farm and not in town where everypony could see you.  Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. 
    Apple Bloom "Silly ways"? 
     
    Granny Smith Uh, thank you kindly, Filthy! 

    Granny Smith Shake a leg there, slowpoke! We got a gaggle's worth of goods to gather before the harvest. Come on!  
    Daisy Hey! You bite it, you buy it! 

     
    Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom Granny, isn't there a less... silly way to get the honey?  
    Granny Smith Oh, isn't this just precious? 
    Apple Bloom Please stop! 
    Granny Smith And it is perfect for makin' our zap apple jam! 
    Apple Bloom Shh! Stop it, Granny! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Apple Bloom Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me! 
    Granny Smith What? Are those fillies your friends? Hello, Half-pint's friends! 
    Silver Spoon Hiii, Granny Smith! Hiii,  Half-pint! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Granny Smith What dolls. Why, when I was little, ponies didn't come that purdy. 
    Apple Bloom Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast. 
    Granny Smith All done, smellybelly.  I got my honey, gooey-goo! Got my honey, gooey-ooh! Got my honey, iddley-hoo! 

    Fillies  
    Filthy Rich And, by capturing the whole sale market, purchasing in bulk and slashing all prices, we undermine every other gift market in town, and that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville. 
    Diamond Tiara  
    Cheerilee Well, thank you, Mr. Filthyâ€”I mean, Mr. Rich. What a wonderful day of sharing! And thank you for being a part of Family Appreciation Day! Now, uh, let's see who will be bringing in a family member for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day. Um... Oh! Apple Bloom! 
    Apple Bloom But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak. 
    Cheerilee Well, is there anypony else in your family that couldâ€“ 
    Diamond Tiara Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's Granny Smith isn't working harvest. She could come. 
    Apple Bloom Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn'tâ€“ 
    Cheerilee That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara! Apple Bloom, you shall bring in Granny Smith on Monday. 
     
    Cheerilee Have a great weekend, everypony! 
    Apple Bloom Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughin' stock of Ponyville! 

    Applejack I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen. 
    Apple Bloom I know... After the fifth day, the zap apples disappear... 
     
     
    Granny Smith Look! The third sign! Right on time! Hot diggity! 
     
    Apple family Wow! 
    Granny Smith Alright, you lazy daisies, move your caboose! 
    Applejack I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell. 
    Apple Bloom I know. That's what I'm worried about. 

    Apple Bloom I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliateâ€“ 
    Scootaloo What are you, a dictionary? 
    Sweetie Belle Snap out of it. We're here to help you! 
    Scootaloo After all, we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders. We'll figure out a way to postpone your presentation. 
    Apple Bloom But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick! 
    Sweetie Belle Sick? 
    Scootaloo That's it! C'mon! 

    Granny Smith Ten-hut! Now listen here, troops! Now, I don't want any whinin' or cryin' or crackin' under pressure! Do I make myself clear!? 
     
    Granny Smith Court-martialed! 
     

    Scootaloo Stay still, Apple Bloom! You have to look sick! 
     
    Apple Bloom Aaah!  Hey, this is hot! 
    Granny Smith What in the hayseed is going on in there, silly billy? 
    Scootaloo Oh, Granny Smith! We were just about to come get you! 
    Sweetie Belle Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week! 
    Granny Smith  Ooh! Perfect as a Piccadilly pear! 
    Apple Bloom Now what? 

    Apple Bloom It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out! 
    Sweetie Belle Hey! Look! 
    Apple Bloom That's the fourth sign! 
     
    Apple Bloom The zap apples have appeared! 
    Sweetie Belle And that gives me an idea! 

     
    Sweetie Belle We can't move Family Appreciation Day, so let's move harvest day instead! 
    Apple Bloom They don't look... quite ripe. 
    Scootaloo Harvesting apples early never hurt an apple. 
    Apple Bloom I don't know... Zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic. 
     
    Sweetie Belle How different can they be? 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Apple Bloom Any other bright ideas? 

     
    Cheerilee Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom said you wanted to speak with me?... Hello? Granny Smiâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom  Well hello there! Howdydoo! 
    Cheerilee Hi... uh... Granny Smith... is, ugh, everything okay? 
    Apple Bloom  Of course it is! Why wouldn't it be? 
    Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom  Oh, er, excuse me. Uh, pickles always give me the hiccups! I need to tell you that I can't make the presentation on Monday after all! 
    Cheerilee Oh no, is that so? 
    Apple Bloom  No doubts about it! I gotta shear the flowers and water the sheep! I mean, I have to water the flowers and shear the sheep! 
    Cheerilee Oh, well, that's too bad. We can reschedule. 
     
    Granny Smith E- whut- hai- where am I? Well, howdy, Miss Cheerilee! You window shopping? 
    Cheerilee Uh... no? You asked me to come here to tell me that you wouldn't be making it to Family Appreciation Day? 
    Granny Smith Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in Canterlot! 
    Cheerilee But- didn't you just say...? 
    Granny Smith See you Monday! 

    Apple Bloom  I wish I could just run off and hide! 
    Sweetie Belle Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can! 

     
     
    Granny Smith Yee-haw! 
    Applejack The zap apple harvest has begun! 
     
    Granny Smith And tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam! 
    Scootaloo  Miss Granny Smith? Telegram. 
    Granny Smith Well, bust my buttons. Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit. 
    Apple Bloom And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag! 
    Granny Smith Well, that was considerate. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Granny Smith But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet! I'll be back in time to make that jam! 
    Apple Bloom  That train ride takes all day. I'm safe. Hah. 

    Cheerilee For today's Family Appreciation Day, we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith. Um... Apple Bloom? Is Granny Smith here? 
    Apple Bloom Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergencyâ€“ 
    Granny Smith Well, howdy, my little ponies! 

    Granny Smith Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig in a fresh mudpile to be here! 
    Apple Bloom Whuh- what are you doing here? Did you miss the train? 
    Granny Smith Er, no, it came. And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it. 
    Apple Strudel Ooooooh, noogie-noogie-noggie!  
    Diamond Tiara I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation.  If she can remember any of it. 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Granny Smith Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville! 

    Granny Smith  That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter. 
     
    Granny Smith  But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip! 
     
    Granny Smith  I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of. 
     
    Granny Smith  My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times. How the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam. 
     
    Granny Smith  And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded. 
     

    Foals  
    Granny Smith Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down. 
    Scootaloo So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?! 
    Granny Smith Darn tootin', little filly! 
    Apple Bloom If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains. 
    Rest of foals  
    Diamond Tiara Butâ€“ 
    Granny Smith  
    Diamond Tiara But she's just a... kooky old lady! 
    Foals  
    Apple Bloom She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville! 

    Scootaloo I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet! 
    Sweetie Belle Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom. 
    Granny Smith You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer! 
    Apple Bloom I am? 
    Applejack So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well? 
    Apple Bloom Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while. 
    Granny Smith Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw. 
    Applejack Who wants to help Granny sing to the water? 
    Foals We do, we do! 

    Granny Smith and Foals A, B, C, D, E, F, G...  
    Filthy Rich Diamond Tiara? 
    Diamond Tiara But dad! 
    Applejack and Apple Bloom  

     
     

Baby Cakes

    Main cast  
    Applejack Can you believe the new baby is finally here? 
    Twilight Sparkle Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud! 
    Rarity I wonder if it's a filly or a colt? 
    Pinkie Pie I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?! 
    Mr. Cake Meet our son, Pound Cake. 
    Pound Cake  
    Main cast Awwww. 
    Mr. Cake ...and our daughter, Pumpkin Cake. 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Main cast Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie Two new foals for me to play with?  That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo!

    Pinkie Pie  Happy happy birthday to you and you todayâ€“ 
     
    Applejack Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn? 
    Mr. Cake Easy. My great-great-great-great grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place. 
    Twilight Sparkle And be careful around Pumpkin Cake. 
    Rarity Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go. 
    Pinkie Pie Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all! 
    Nurse Redheart Shhh!

    Mrs. Cake Everything okay in there? Who needs a diaper change? 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, they're fine!  Oogh, I mean...

    Pinkie Pie Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh! 
    Mr. Cake  No, y'see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped. 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again? 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Mrs. Cake Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things. 
    Mr. Cake Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake. 
    Pinkie Pie Except food. 
    Mrs. Cake  Food! Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot. 
    Pinkie Pie No, you just fed them bottles, remember? 
    Mrs. Cake Not the babies' food! 
    Mr. Cake Gh! The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today! 
    Mrs. Cake Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted! 
    Mr. Cake Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this. 
    Pinkie Pie I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it! 
    Mrs. Cake I wonder who would be available on such short notice. 
    Pinkie Pie Me! Me! Pick me! 

    Fluttershy Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me, are you? Please don't be mad at me! 
    Pinkie Pie I'll do it! Pick me! 

    Twilight Sparkle I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess. 
    Pinkie Pie I wanna babysit! Pick me! 

     
     
    Applejack Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm o' hungry caterpillars headin' this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it! 

    Rainbow Dash I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash! 
    Pinkie Pie Ask me! Mememememememememememememe! 

    Rarity Moi? Babysit? N- Oh nonononononononono! I'm flattered that you would think about me though. 
    Mr. Cake  Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us? 
    Pinkie Pie  I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule. 

     
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Mr. Cake Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies? 
    Pinkie Pie I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie. 
    Mrs. Cake But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them. You have to be responsible. 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, I know. I will. I am. 
     
    Mrs. Cake Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list. 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! That's a lot of responsiâ€“ Consider it done. 
    Mr. Cake  We'll frost it when we get there! C'mon, sugarplum, tick-tick! 
    Mrs. Cake Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps! 
    Pinkie Pie No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Everything is under control. 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Uh-oh. 

    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Oh, don't cry, little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Where's Pinkie Pie?

    Pinkie Pie Get it? Tractors that small?  The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him! 
     
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Gee, tough crowd.  Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!

    Pinkie Pie Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh! Thank goodness they're home! 

    Twilight Sparkle Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa! 
    Pinkie Pie Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by. 
    Pinkie Pie Ex-cuse me? 
    Twilight Sparkle Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility. 
    Pinkie Pie Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm happy to help! It's no troubleâ€“ 
     
    Pinkie Pie Well, of all theâ€“ She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own! 

    Pound Cake  
     
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Pound Cake.  This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister! 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep! 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie  Sleep tight. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Now that's what I call handling things.  

    Pinkie Pie Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are! 
     
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie! 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Pound Cake?  Here, Pound Cake! 
     
    Pound Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Uh, Pound Cake? Uh... 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pound Cake  
    Pumpkin Cake  
     
    Pound Cake  
    Pinkie Pie  You can fly?! 
    Pound Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt!  I'm responsible for you! 
     
    Pumpkin Cake  Nom nom nom. 
    Pinkie Pie No no no, Pumpkin. 
    Pumpkin Cake Nom nom. 
    Pinkie Pie No no. 
    Pumpkin Cake Nom. 
    Pinkie Pie No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no. 
    Pound Cake Wheeee! 
    Pinkie Pie That goes for you too, Pound Cake! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Gotcha! I think?  
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble! 
     
     
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one? 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Pinkie Pie  Y'know, you're right. That is funny. 

    Pound Cake  
    Pumpkin Cake  

    Pinkie Pie Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it. 

     
    Mr. Cake Pinkie Pie! We're back! 
    Mrs. Cake How did everything go?  
    Mr. Cake Are we in the right place? 
    Pinkie Pie Shhh! 
    Pound Cake  
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Mrs. Cake P-Pinkie. This is just... just... 
    Mr. Cake Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis? 
    Pinkie Pie  Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never! 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Pound Cake Pinkie... 
    Pumpkin Cake Pie... 
    Pinkie Pie  I have some free time next Tuesday. 

     
     

The Last Roundup

     
     
    Apple Bloom Whoo-- Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition! 
    Applejack Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so. 
    Apple Bloom Hope so? I know so! After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champeen of Ponyville! Why, you've got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever! And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champeen! 

     

    Rainbow Dash Huh? Now, careful, Derpy! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done. 
     
    Derpy I just don't know what went wrong. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. It's a mystery. 
    Derpy Nice work, Rainbow Dash. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Derpy You okay, Rainbow Dash? Anything I can do to help? 
    Rainbow Dash No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing! 
     
     
    Derpy Oops. My bad. 
    Crowd Applejack! Applejack! Applejack! Applejack!  
    Mayor Mare Everypony, can I get your attention? Attention please! 
    Crowd  
    Mayor Mare Yes, we are all here to send Applejack to compete in this year's Equestria Rodeo competition in Canterlot. 
    Crowd  
    Mayor Mare And I want to thank Applejack in advance for generously offering up her prize money to fix town hall. 
    Derpy Yeah, Applejack! Whoo-hoo! 
     
    Crowd  
    Pinkie Pie Speech! Speech! 
    Applejack Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches. 
    Pinkie Pie Alright then, no speech! 
    Applejack Buuut! This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud. 
    Crowd  

     
    Granny Smith I want you to show all them highfalutin rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like! 
    Applejack You betcha, Granny Smith. 
    Mayor Mare And bring back all that money! 
    Applejack You betcha, Mayor. 
    Pinkie Pie And have fun. And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy and taffy gives lots of nervous energy!  
    Twilight Sparkle Just do your best, Applejack. 
    Applejack I'll do better than my best! 
    Conductor The train to Canterlot is about to leave! All aboard who's coming aboard! 
    Applejack Guess that means me. 
    Rainbow Dash Seeya in a week! 
    Apple Bloom With lots of new blue ribbons! 
    Mayor Mare And lots of money! 
    Applejack Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons! 
    Assembled ponies  
    Pinkie Pie And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass. 

    Fluttershy Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, that is the point. 
    Fluttershy I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling. 
    Pinkie Pie Surprise! 
     
     
    Fluttershy  Oh, Pinkie, you startled me. 
    Pinkie Pie Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria! Surprise! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, Twilight. Got my lips all limbered up!  
     
    Ponies Surprise! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Pinkie Pie Surprise! Shoot! 
    Parcel Post Wow, this is the best surprise ever! How did you know it was my birthday? 
     
    Apple Bloom Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's from Applejack. "Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville." 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle "...Don't worry, will send money soon." That's all there is. 
    Ponies  
    Apple Bloom Applejack's... not comin' back? 
    Rainbow Dash What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville! 
    Granny Smith And she loves Sweet Apple Acres! 
    Apple Bloom And she loves her family! 
    Rarity  Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return! 
    Fluttershy Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared! 
    Rainbow Dash So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back. 
    Apple Bloom Y'all are the best. 
    Granny Smith Thank you, girls!  Our little bushel just lost one apple. 
    Big McIntosh  

     

     

     

    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her. 
    Fluttershy I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville! 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop! 
    Twilight Sparkle This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, pickles!  Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there! 
     
    Applejack Huh, some ponies. Sheesh. 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! 
    Rarity Oh, Applejack, thank heavens! 
    Fluttershy We're so glad you're safe! 
    Pinkie Pie I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back. 
     
    Applejack Uh, hey, everypony. What's up? 
    Rainbow Dash Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?! 
    Rarity Yes, why are you here? 
     
    Fluttershy Are you okay? 
    Pinkie Pie Do you have any snacks? 
    Twilight Sparkle Tell us what happened, Applejack! 
    Cherry Jubilee Applejack? Are these some of your Ponyville friends? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, ma'am. 
    Rarity And you are? 
    Cherry Jubilee Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch. Hasn't Applejack told ya? I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo. Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life. 
    Applejack Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that. 
    Cherry Jubilee Oh, she's so modest. Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back. So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction. Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends. See you back at the ranch. 
    Rainbow Dash "Change of scenery"? What's that supposed to mean? 
    Applejack S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story. 
    Pinkie Pie That's it? Well, that's a terrible story! 
    Applejack Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay. 
    Rainbow Dash Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you! 
    Applejack Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something. 
    Rainbow Dash Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans. 
    Pinkie Pie What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky! 

    Cherry Jubilee You ready to put your back into it, Applejack? 
    Applejack Sure am, Miss Jubilee. 
    Cherry Jubilee Terr-ific. Come on in, girls! 
    Applejack What are you all doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started? 
    Applejack Fine. 
    Cherry Jubilee Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other. Simple as cherry pie. Uh, just one teensy thing to remember â€“ have fun! 
    Applejack What are you five up to? 
    Rarity Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful. 
    Applejack Uh-huh. Well, just remember No talking about Ponyville. 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town. 
    Applejack Canterlot was fine. 
    Twilight Sparkle Was the rodeo fun? 
    Applejack Yes. 
    Twilight Sparkle Did you meet some nice ponies there? 
    Applejack Some. 
    Rainbow Dash Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane? 
    Applejack Yes, I saw 'em both. 
    Rarity And how did you meet Miss Jubilee? 
    Applejack Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats. 
    Fluttershy Um, excuse me? 
    Applejack Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all. 
    Twilight Sparkle So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres? 
    Applejack Yes. 
    Rainbow Dash Did you tell her why you weren't going back? 
    Applejack No, 'cuz it was none of her business! 
    Fluttershy Ooh... Can you please slow down? 
    Rainbow Dash Is it because I made it rain on you that one time? 
    Applejack No! 
    Fluttershy Help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards? 
    Applejack NO! 
     
    Rarity Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair? 
    Applejack No, no, NO! I'm not telling you why, so justâ€“ 
    Fluttershy STOP! 
     
     
    Rest of main cast  

    Twilight Sparkle Well, girls, we seem to be striking out. 
    Rainbow Dash That's 'cause we're playing too nice. 
    Rarity Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures. 
    Rainbow Dash It's time to call in the big guns. 

     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, Applejack. Need some help? 
    Applejack You promise not to ask me any questions? 
    Pinkie Pie I promise. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question. 
    Applejack That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga! 
    Applejack No! Make it stop, make it stop! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans! 
    Applejack Never! 
    Pinkie Pie Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean...  
    Applejack Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out. 
    Rainbow Dash Tomorrow, huh? I don't know... 
    Pinkie Pie Do you Pinkie promise? 
    Applejack  I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, maybe. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Good morning, Applejack. You ready for brâ€“  
     
    Pinkie Pie Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise! 

    Pinkie Pie Applejack!  You Pinkie promised! 
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie Applejack, come back here! 
    Applejack Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge! 
    Coach ponies  
    Pinkie Pie She's gonna get away! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, she won't! Look, girls! 
    Pinkie Pie Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now! 
     
    Rabbit  

    Applejack Whoa! What the hay? 
    Rainbow Dash Pull over! 
    Applejack Hey! Cut that out! Whoa!  I'll pay you double to outrun them. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll pay you triple to slow down! 
    Applejack I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust! 
     
    Rest of main cast  
    Rarity That was rude! 
    Pinkie Pie Get them! Get them! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Fluttershy! 
    Applejack Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go! 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize! 
    Applejack Pinkie, I did not break my promise! 
    Pinkie Pie Wha? 
    Applejack If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I... I... 
    Applejack I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't! 
    Pinkie Pie Well I heard a "sorry" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me. 
    Rarity What? Pinkieâ€“  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow, go back! 
    Rainbow Dash No time! They knew what they were getting into! 
    Rarity  

     
    Applejack Yes. Hyah! 
     
     
    Applejack Yee-haw! 
    Coach ponies  Lady, you're trouble. 
    Applejack Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Not so fast! 
     
    Applejack Fine. Now you know. 
    Twilight Sparkle Know what? 
    Applejack Well, just look! 
    Twilight Sparkle I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said! 
    Applejack Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money. 
    Rainbow Dash But the telegram said you were gonna send money. 
    Applejack That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, you're not a failure. 
    Rainbow Dash And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books. 
    Applejack So... you're not upset or disappointed? 
    Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle Nn-nn. 
    Applejack But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof. 
    Fluttershy Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts. 
    Rainbow Dash  Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy! 

    Applejack Dear Princess Celestia, 
    It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family. 

    Pinkie Pie What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga?  
    Rarity When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!  
    Pinkie Pie  

     
     

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000

     
    Fluttershy  Who could that be? It's still dark! 
     
    Rainbow Dash C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start! 
    Fluttershy  Oh, where are we? What's the rush? 
    Rainbow Dash The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever? 
    Fluttershy Um, well, uhâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider! 
    Fluttershy I guess Iâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Well, not this year! This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want and laugh when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of herâ€“  
    Fluttershy Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style. 
    Rainbow Dash Who are all these ponies?! 
    Pinkie Pie Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any. 
    Rainbow Dash  

     

    Twilight Sparkle Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season! 
    Spike Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season! 
    Applejack  Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open! 
    Ponies  
     

     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Applejack Heh. Sorry, everypony! That's it for today! 
    Ponies Awww. 
    Rainbow Dash Surprise, surprise. You ran out again! 
    Caramel Yeah, you always run out! 
    Fluttershy For the record, I don't mindâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me! 
    Ponies  
    Applejack Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year- 
    Caramel You always say that! 
    Applejack And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time. 
    Ponies  
    Applejack If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow. 
    Pinkie Pie She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection! 
    Fluttershy Uh, Pinkie Pieâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie I'll never forget the cider I just drank! It was a moment in time that will never exist again.  
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Applejack What in Equestria is that?

        The fun begins! 

    Flim Now, here's where the magic happens. Right here in this heaving, roiling, cider-press-boiling guts of the very machine, those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak being turned into grade-A, top-notch, five-star, blow-your-horseshoes-off, one-of-a-kind cider!

        You went and over-sold it! 
        I guarantee that what you have there won't compare 
        For the very most important ingredient 
        Can't be added or done expedient 
        And it's quality, friends, Apple Acres' quality and care! 

    

        Well, Granny, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up 
        You see that we are very picky when it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup 

    

        Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, this great machine lets just the very best 
        So whaddaya say then, Apples? 
        Care to step into the modern world 
        And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to the test? 

    

        Cider, cider, cider, cider...  

    Flim What do you think, folks? Do you see what the Apples can't? I see it clear as day! I know she does! So does he! C'mon, Ponyville, you know what I'm talking about! 

    

        We're saying you've got 

    

        Opportunity 
        In this very community 
        He's Flim, he's Flam 
        We're the world famous Flim Flam Brothers 
        Traveling salesponies nonpareil! 

    

        Yeah! 

    Apple Bloom You got a deal! 
    Crowd  
    Granny Smith Not so fast! No way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider! 
    Apple Bloom But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy! 
    Applejack I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. Huh? 
    Flim We'll sweeten the deal. You supply the apples... 
    Flam ...We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000. 
    Flim and Flam Then we split those sweet sweet profits... 
    Flim ...Seventy-five... 
    Flam ...Twenty-five. 
    Apple Bloom Dealâ€“ 
    Applejack Hold on. Who gets the seventy five? 
    Flim Why, us, naturally. 
    Flam And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free. 
    Applejack Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this. 
    Flim and Flam So? What'll it be? 
    Big McIntosh No deal. 
    Flim Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors. 
    Applejack You wouldn't dare. 
    Flim Oh no? 
    Flam Don't you worry, everypony! There'll be plenty of cider for all of you! 
    Flim  Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business. 
    Apple family  
    Apple Bloom What? 

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Still worried about Flim and Flam? 
    Spike Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air. 
    Applejack I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business. 
    Apple Bloom That's it! Last cup! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, for Pete's sake! 
    Crowd  
    Apple Bloom C'mon back tomorrow, everypony! 
    Crowd  
     
     
    Flim What seems to be the problem here? 
    Flam Oh my, oh my, out of cider again? 
    Flim What have we here? Who'd like a cup? 
    Crowd  
    Flam Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant! 
     
    Applejack You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples! 
    Rainbow Dash Is this some kind of cruel joke? 
    Flim Don't worry, everypony, there are plenty of apples in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of Ponyville can drink! 
    Crowd  
    Apple Bloom We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine! 
    Crowd  
    Granny Smith Now, it ain't about the speed, young'un, it's about quality. 
    Crowd  
    Rainbow Dash Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any? 
    Flim Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies. 
    Apple Bloom Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country! 
    Applejack Our cider speaks for itself! 
    Flim Let's put it to the test! 
    Apple Bloom Anywhere, anytime! 
    Crowd  
    Granny Smith Well, that's enough now. 
    Flam With our machine, we can make enough cider in one hour to satisfy this entire town! 
    Apple Bloom We'll do it in 45 minutes! 
    Crowd  
    Granny Smith Easy, Apple Bloom, easy. 
    Flim What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken? 
    Granny Smith What did you call me, sonny? 
    Flim If you're so confident in your cider, then what's the problem? 
    Granny Smith Tomorrow mornin', right here! 
    Flam But I'm afraid we haven't any...  ...apples. 
    Granny Smith You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making! 
    Flim Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville. 
    Granny Smith And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again! 
    Crowd  
    Flam Until tomorrow. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow! 
    Applejack We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm. 

    Granny Smith  
    Applejack  
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea? 
    Applejack Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities. 
    Apple Bloom And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken. 
    Mayor Mare  Attention, everypony! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, good luck. 
    Applejack Thanks, Twilight. We'll need it. 
    Mayor Mare  The teams have one hour to produce as much cider as they can, after which the barrels will be counted and the winner will be named the sole cider provider for all of Ponyville! 
    Crowd  
    Mayor Mare Are both teams ready? 
    Granny Smith  
    Applejack Ready! 
    Flim and Flam Ready! 
    Mayor Mare Then let's... go! 
     
    Granny Smith Ugh, bad 'un. Good 'un! Bad 'un... 
    Applejack Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel! 
    Apple Bloom I'll bet you those guys don't even haveâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh and Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom What?! 
     
    Applejack  

     
     
    Applejack C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'! 
    Apple Bloom Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind! 
    Granny Smith Egh...  Good 'un... Ugh, bad 'un... 
    Applejack Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride! 
    Rarity This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three! 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition? 
    Mayor Mare Well, I'm not sure... Flim, Flam, would you object to honorary family members helping? 
    Flim Are you kidding? 
    Flam We don't care if the whole kingdom of Canterlot helps. It's a lost cause. 
    Mayor Mare Hm, I guess it's okay. Applejack? What do you think? 
    Applejack I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out. 
    Rest of main cast All right! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm. 
    Rest of main cast Yeah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees. 
    Fluttershy Got it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail. 
    Pinkie Pie Yessir, ma'am, sir! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station. 
    Rarity Of course. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press? 
    Rainbow Dash In my sleep! 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres! 
    Rest of main cast All right! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them! 
    Apple Bloom Right behind you, Pinkie Pie! 
    Granny Smith Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un... 
    Rarity Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely... 
    Twilight Sparkle Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs! 
    Crowd  
    Applejack Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this! 
    Flim  Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace! 
    Flam Right, uh, double the power! 
     
    Flim We've gotta try something else! 
    Flam I've got it, brother of mine. 
     
    Flim Well done, Flam! We're at top productivity! 
    Crowd  
    Twilight Sparkle C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding! 
    Rainbow Dash We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing! 
    Granny Smith  Get back, you! One bad apple spoils the bunch! 
    Rainbow Dash Applejack, help me! 
    Applejack There's no point in winnin' if we cheat! 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony! 
    Rainbow Dash All right then, double time! 

    Mayor Mare Time's up! 
    Main cast and Apple family  
    Crowd  
    Mayor Mare  
    Twilight Sparkle I'm proud of you, Applejack. 
    Applejack Thanks.  
    Twilight Sparkle Integrity like that will always be... rewarded. 
    Mayor Mare Flim and Flam win! 
    Crowd  
    Apple Bloom Wh, whâ€“ 
    Applejack We... lost? 
    Flim Daww, too bad, Apples. 
    Flam Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly. 
    Flim Now should we tear down all these tacky old buildings and put up new ones, brother? 
    Flam I don't see why not, brother. After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore. How about 'Flim Flam Fields'? 
    Rainbow Dash I ought to press you into jerk cider! 
    Applejack No, Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal. 
    Flim and Flam  
    Applejack Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things. 
    Flim Fear not, everypony, there's more than enough cider to go around. 
    Flim and Flam  
    Applejack Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Flam Drink up, Ponyville! Down the hatch! 
    Ponies  
    Cherry Berry I can't get the taste off my tongue! 
    Sweetie Drops Mine's got rocks in it! 
    Comet Tail I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck! 
    Flam You wouldn't pay even one cent? 
    Crowd No! 
    Flim and Flam  
    Flam How about two cups for one cent? 
    Crowd No! 
    Flim and Flam  Two bits for a barrel? 
    Crowd NO! 
    Flam  It looks like we've encountered a slight... problem here in Ponyville. 
    Flim Nopony wants our product. Next town? 
    Flam Next town. Let's go, Flim! 
    Flim Let's go, Flam! 
     
    Applejack They're gone. 
    Twilight Sparkle That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business! 
    Caramel Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider! 
    Apple Bloom Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town! 
    Crowd  

    Applejack Dear Princess Celestia, 
    I wanted to share my thoughts with you.  I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already too. 

     
     

Read It and Weep

     
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Rarity. Hey, Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at? 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I meanâ€” 
    Rarity She's dazzling! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, yeah, that's a good word. She's dazzling! 
    Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, oh no, oh no! 
    Pinkie Pie Ai yi yi yi yi! 
     
    Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle Oohh. 
    Pinkie Pie So much for dazzling. 

     

     
    Applejack  Is she gonna be okay? 
    Fluttershy  Oh, I'm so worried! 
    Pinkie Pie  Is her face gonna stay that way? 
    Rainbow Dash Awwww. 
    Twilight Sparkle How is she, doctor? 
    Doctor Horse She's going to be fine. Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do! 
    Doctor Horse Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum. 
    Rainbow Dash You guys have gotta get me out of here! I'm gonna climb the walls! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, just like a spider!  Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers? 
    Doctor Horse Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers. She needs to stay in bed for a few days. 
    Rainbow Dash Few days? Might as well be a few months, or a few years! 
    Fluttershy It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash. 
    Applejack I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good. 
    Rarity And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains! 
    Pinkie Pie And look! You have a roommate! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is the first story in the series. I own all of them.  
    Rainbow Dash No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Applejack Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time? 
    Rarity Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really... 
    "Nurse Sweetheart" All right, my little ponies. Rainbow Dash needs her rest. You'll have to come back tomorrow. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable. 
     

     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash ...to get to the other side! Get it? Never mind... 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash  "As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years!" Huh. I'm right there with you, sister. 

    Rainbow Dash  "The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step." 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  "Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!" 

    Rainbow Dash I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I... I love reading! I'm an egghead. 

    Rainbow Dash  "The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple." 
     
     
     
     
    Daring Do Phew! 
     
    Daring Do  
     
     

     
    Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle Hi, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, hey, guys... 
    Fluttershy We thought we'd come and cheer you up! 
    Twilight Sparkle We brought your favorite board game! 
    Fluttershy We know how much you like to win! 
    Twilight Sparkle You go first, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash  No no, you first. 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, uh... cloud three. 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again! 
    Fluttershy Um... sky five? 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, you found my seagull. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... cloud two? 
    Rainbow Dash You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud. You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose.  
    Fluttershy But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn. 
    Rainbow Dash You win some, you lose some. 
    Twilight Sparkle But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game ofâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash  Thanks for coming! 
    Twilight Sparkle But yesterday you were desperate for things to do! 
    Rainbow Dash Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading.  
    Fluttershy Glad we could... cheer you up? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Alright then. 
     
    Rainbow Dash "Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber." 

    Rainbow Dash  "At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!" 
     
     
    Daring Do Hmm, there must be a pattern here. What do all these animals have in common? Ah-ha! These animals are all predators... except... rats! Phew! 
     
     
     
     
     
    Ahuizotl  Hello, Rainbow Dash! 

     
    Rarity How's our patient doing today? 
    Applejack Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, butâ€” 
    Nurse Snowheart Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, just in time. I am sooo hungry. 
    Rarity Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash. 
    Applejack Yeah, just go ahead and eat up. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Uh, on second thoughtâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh... 
     
    Rainbow Dash  "'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.'" 

    Ahuizotl And now, you shall meet your doom!  
     
    Ahuizotl  

    Rainbow Dash Whoa! Who is this dude? 

    Daring Do  You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl! 
    Ahuizotl But I already have. 
     
    Daring Do  Not again... 
     
    Daring Do Quicksand!  
    Doctor Horse  Rainbow Dash? 

    Doctor Horse  Rainbow Da-ash! 
    Rainbow Dash Hâ€” oh, good eveningâ€” 
    Doctor Horse Morning. 
    Rainbow Dash â€”morning. Doc. 
    Doctor Horse Have you been up all night? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, of course not.  
    Doctor Horse Well, I'll be quick. Congratulations, Rainbow Dash, we're checking you out of the hospital. 
    Rainbow Dash What? Later today?  
    Doctor Horse No. Right now! 
    Rainbow Dash Right now?! 'Right now' right now? 
    Doctor Horse 'Right now' right now. 
     
    Rainbow Dash But I don't feel better! 
    Doctor Horse Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash. Remember to stay off that wing for a week. 
     
    Rainbow Dash How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?! 

    Rainbow Dash Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, this is making me sick all over again! 

    Rainbow Dash Owww...  Oh, the pain... the pain! 
    Doctor Horse Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here, a-anything wrong? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there. 
    Doctor Horse I was touching your good wing. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too. 
    Doctor Horse  I think I know what the trouble is. A severe case of lazy-itis. 
    Rainbow Dash B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy! 
    Doctor Horse You're fine, Rainbow Dash. Give it some time and you'll be right back in the swing of things. 
    "Nurse Sweetheart" Good day, Rainbow Dash. 
    Nurse Snowheart Take care! 
    Rainbow Dash What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing... 

     

    Rainbow Dash  
     

    Daring Do Feels like the harder I struggle,  the tighter the ropes get! 
    Spider  Help! Burglar, burglar! 

    "Fuzzy Slippers" Someone's trying to steal my slippers! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book! 
     
    "Nurse Sweetheart" Stop, thief! 
     
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, nopony invited me! 
     
    Rarity Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep? 
    Doctor Horse Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on? Why are you stealing slippers? 
    Screwy  
    Night Watch Hey, get back to the hospital! 
    Applejack What's all the ruckus? 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash  I'm an egghead. 
    Rarity Pardon? 
    Rainbow Dash See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter ofâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle â€”'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'! 
    Rainbow Dash You got me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft! 
    Rainbow Dash Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'm glad that's all this is about. 
    Applejack There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckusâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Fracas! 
    Applejack ...causin' a fracas just because you like to read. 

    Twilight Sparkle Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, thanks, Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart! 
    Spike Yeah, just look at me!  
    Twilight Sparkle Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess. 
    Rainbow Dash  Didja get all that? 
    Spike Yeah? 
    Rainbow Dash Great! You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book!  

    Daring Do  
     
    Daring Do  Another day, another dungeon! 

    Ahuizotl  
    Daring Do I'll take that! 
    Ahuizotl Huh? Whaâ€”? Noooooooo! 
    Daring Do Better luck next time, Ahuizotl! 
    Ahuizotl Curse you, Daring Do!  
    Rainbow Dash  "And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured..." 

    Rainbow Dash "...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!"  'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'. Awesome! 

     
     

Hearts and Hooves Day

     
     
    Apple Bloom Hmm... I just don't feel like it's quite finished. 
    Sweetie Belle I know what you mean. If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect. Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all. 
    Scootaloo I say we add a little more ribbon! 
    Sweetie Belle Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. And just a tiny bit more lace. 
    Apple Bloom A few more hoof-prints. 
    Scootaloo Glitter! It could definitely use just a little more glitter! 
    Apple Bloom Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school. 
    Scootaloo I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope. 

     

     
    Diamond Tiara I like the red ones. 

    Cheerilee It's lovely. And so... big! 
    Apple Bloom We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Dayâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo Ever! 
    Cheerilee Thank you so much, girls. I love it. I really do. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your... very special somepony. 
    Cheerilee Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment. 
    Apple Bloom Really? 
    Sweetie Belle How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day? 
    Cheerilee It's alright, Sweetie Belle. I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day. Alright, everypony, who's ready to play "Pin the Heart on the Pony"? 
     
    Apple Bloom If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her. 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom Uh, you all right? 
    Sweetie Belle I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony. 
    Apple Bloom That is the best idea ever. 
    Sweetie Belle  Tooold yooou! 
    Apple Bloom So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already. 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Scootaloo Let's do it! 

    Sweetie Belle Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony. 

    

        Cheerilee is sweet and kind, 
        She's the best teacher we could hope for. 
        The perfect stallion you and I must find 
        One to really make her heart so-o-oar. 
        But... 
        This one's too young, 
        This one's too old. 
        He clearly has a terrible cold. 

    "Hay Fever" Achoo! 

    

        This guy's too silly. 
        He's way too uptight. 

    "Persnickety" I say! 

    

        Well nothing's wrong with this one, 
        He seems alright... 

    Scootaloo His girlfriend sure thinks so. 

    

        How 'bout this one? 

    

        He's much too flashy. 

    

        He might do! 

    

        If he weren't so splashy! 

    

        Too short. 

    

        Too tall. 

    

        Too clean. 

    

        Too smelly. 

    

        Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly. 

    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  

    

        I don't think that we're mistaken, 
        It seems all the good ones are taken. 

    

        I really feel that at this rate, 
        We'll never find the perfect date. 

    

        Don't wanna quit and give up hope! 

    Scootaloo Doing anything special for Hearts and Hooves Day? 

    

        Oh please, oh please oh please say- 

    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  

    

        We did it girls, 
        We've found the one, 
        Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter! 

    Apple Bloom Wait a minute. Lemme get this straight. Are you talkin' 'bout my brother? 

    Scootaloo Sweetie Belle is right. Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee. He's really nice, super hard-working. 
    Apple Bloom Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony. 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe he doesn't have to. 
    Apple Bloom Huh? 
    Sweetie Belle If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him. 
    Scootaloo Sounds like a plan to me. 
    Apple Bloom So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date! 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle Yay! 

    Sweetie Belle Flowers. Don't forget the flowers. 
    Apple Bloom Oops. I'm on it! 
    Scootaloo  They're coming! This is gonna be perfect. Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever. 
    Sweetie Belle With her new very special somepony. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Cheerilee Hi, girls. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle Hi, Miss Cheerilee. 
    Cheerilee So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo? 
     
    Cheerilee  That's an apple tree. 
    Apple Bloom Is it? 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom Oh, sorry, big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See? 
    Scootaloo As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two. 
    Apple Bloom I guess we'll just be goin' then. 
     
    Scootaloo You really think this'll work? 
    Sweetie Belle Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other. 
    Cheerilee Beautiful day we're having. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Cheerilee Any big plans for tonight? 
    Big McIntosh Nnnope. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony. 
    Sweetie Belle  Ohmigosh, look. 
    Cheerilee Big Mac... 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup? 
    Cheerilee You have something stuck in your teeth. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Aw, come on! 
     
    Cheerilee Well this has been... strange. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Cheerilee I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend. 
    Big McIntosh Yup. 

    Apple Bloom  Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough? 
    Scootaloo Maybe it was too romantic. 
    Sweetie Belle  Either way, we failed. 
    Apple Bloom  There's gotta be somethin' else we couldâ€“ UGH! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry. 
    Apple Bloom Aw, it's okay, Twilight. It was an accident. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion? 
    Sweetie Belle Did you say... a love potion? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's right. It even has the recipe. 
    Sweetie Belle I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'llâ€“ 

    Sweetie Belle  Take a tuft of cloud; 
     
    Sweetie Belle A bright rainbow's glow; 
     
    Sweetie Belle Stir with a Pegasus featherâ€“ 
     
    Scootaloo Hey! 
    Sweetie Belle Fast, not slow. 
    Apple Bloom Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know. 

    Apple Bloom I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way. 
    Sweetie Belle What's the problem? We all agreed these two are perfect for one another. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, they just need a little nudge. 
    Sweetie Belle And what could make them happier than being together, right? 
    Apple Bloom Right! 
    Scootaloo Oh, oh, here they come. 
    Apple Bloom Hiya, Miss Cheerilee. 
    Cheerilee Hello again, girls. Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you hereâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle Punch! 
    Cheerilee Excuse me? 
    Sweetie Belle Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first. 
    Apple Bloom Yup. 
    Sweetie Belle We thought you two would be perfect together. To test it. Together. So, uh, we'll just leave you two alone. Together, to test it.  
    Cheerilee I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you. 
    Cheerilee and Big McIntosh  
    Cheerilee I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Sweetie Belle I think they're gonna drink it. 
    Cheerilee To good friends! 
     
    Scootaloo They're drinking it. They're drinking it! 
    Big McIntosh and Cheerilee  
    Scootaloo They're looking into each other's eyes. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  They're about to be in for a big surprise! 
    Cheerilee Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Yup? 
    Cheerilee Will you be my very special somepony? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Sweetie Belle YES! 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  He's her special somepony! She's his special somepony! 
    Cheerilee He's my special somepony. 
    Big McIntosh Eeeeeyup. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle Aww! 
    Cheerilee He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie. 
    Big McIntosh You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie. 
    Apple Bloom Did he just sayâ€“ 
    Cheerilee You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny. 
    Big McIntosh You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby. 
    Apple Bloom Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on? 
    Sweetie Belle Miss Cheerilee, are you alright? 
    Cheerilee I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear. 
    Sweetie Belle I think we may have given them too big of a nudge. 
    Big McIntosh You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie. 
    Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo Eugh!! 
    Scootaloo Ya think? 

    Apple Bloom What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball! 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe we added too much rainbow. 
    Scootaloo Or maybe not enough cloud. 
    Sweetie Belle Or maybe... uh-oh. 
    Apple Bloom Whaddaya mean, "uh-oh?!" 
    Sweetie Belle We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo What?! 
    Sweetie Belle Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well. 
    Apple Bloom How "not so well" did things turn out? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties. 
    Apple Bloom Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy! 
    Scootaloo Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties. 
    Apple Bloom But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos! 
    Sweetie Belle There's an antidote! 
    Apple Bloom Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there? 
    Sweetie Belle If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken. 
    Scootaloo Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second. 

    Cheerilee You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles. 
    Big McIntosh No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'. 
    Cheerilee No, you, shnooky-lumps. 
    Big McIntosh No, you, pookie-pie. 
    Mrs. Cake I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two? 
    Sweetie Belle  Who knows? 
    Mrs. Cake Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business. 
    Sweetie Belle A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married! 
    Apple Bloom How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart? 
    Sweetie Belle They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married. 
    Cheerilee  No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear! 
    Big McIntosh Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny! 
    Sweetie Belle Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you? 
    Cheerilee I have a very special somepony. 
     
    Big McIntosh I have a very special somepony. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, we noticed. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married. 
     
    Cheerilee and Big McIntosh Married?! 
    Sweetie Belle That's right. Maaarriiied. 
    Cheerilee and Big McIntosh Married... 
    Apple Bloom  Ugh! 
     
    Apple Bloom 'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your â€“ ugh! â€“ shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie. 
    Big McIntosh Diamond! 
    Cheerilee  Shmoopy! 
    Scootaloo Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your...  honey-bunny snuggle-baby. 
     
    Cheerilee Oh! Dress! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac. 
    Apple Bloom No problem. 
     
     
    Sweetie Belle Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over. 

    Sweetie Belle This one looks nice. Better try it on though. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go. 

     
    Apple Bloom No. 
     
    Apple Bloom No. 
     
    Apple Bloom Not that one either. 
     
    Apple Bloom No. 
     
    Apple Bloom Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny. 
    "Karat" Mmm. 
    Apple Bloom Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad. 
    Scootaloo We still have twenty five minutes. 
    Apple Bloom  Where's my brother? 
    "Karat" He made his purchase and departed out the back. Said something about needing to see his... shmoopy-shmoo. 
    Scootaloo Ugh. 
    Apple Bloom  

     
    Apple Bloom Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle. 
     
    Apple Bloom Huhâ€“ 
     
    Apple Bloom  

    Scootaloo  
    Sweetie Belle What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac? 
    Scootaloo On  out of boutique. 

    Apple Bloom Huh? 
     
     
    Scootaloo Move away! 
    Apple Bloom He'll get to her! He's too strong! 
    Sweetie Belle Let him go! 
    Big McIntosh Shmoopy-dooâ€“ Whoa! 
    Scootaloo  I sure am glad you found those shovels. 
     
    Apple Bloom One more minute and the spell will be broken! 
    Big McIntosh Shmoopy-doo! 
    Cheerilee Sweetums?! 
     
     
     
    Big McIntosh Shmoopy-doo! 
     
     
     
    Apple Bloom Aaaaâ€“ 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Oh, please be normal, please be normal. 
    Cheerilee Am I wearing a wedding veil? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Cheerilee Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Cheerilee Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit? 
    Sweetie Belle We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty. 
    Apple Bloom But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day. 
    Scootaloo Our hearts and hooves were in the right place. 
    Cheerilee We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy butâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship. 
    Scootaloo Nopony can force two ponies to be together. 
    Sweetie Belle It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle We're sorry. 
    Cheerilee And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here? 
    Cheerilee Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo. Ready, sugar bear? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup, pumpkin pie. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle  NOOOOO!!!

    Pinkie Pie I've never seen you before. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Kid, you're smarter than you look. 
    Pinkie Pie Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? "Property of C.D.D." I'm guessing that last "D" is for "Donkey". 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Quick as a whip, kid. 
    Pinkie Pie Now, how 'bout that "C"? Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cletus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopherâ€“? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?! 
    Pinkie Pie And your middle name? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  Doodle. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm sorry? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  Doodle. 
    Pinkie Pie One more time...! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  Doodle. 
    Pinkie Pie  So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey? 

    

        You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy. 
        A Cranky Doodle Donkey. 
        I never met you but you're my new friend 
        and I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie! 

    Pinkie Pie C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Nopony calls me Doodle! 
    Pinkie Pie What just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check! 

    Pinkie Pie Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey What gave you the hint there, kid? The cart full of stuff, maybe? 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria my entire life. I've made many friends. I don't need any more. 
    Pinkie Pie Gosh! I could never have too many friends! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Well, why don't you go and make some more? 
    Pinkie Pie But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Look, kid, yâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Look, kid, I came to Ponyville for some peace and quiet and privacy, to be alone with my memories. All I want is to get to my new home and unpack my stuff. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, what does this bauble do? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Don't touch that! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooooooh, what's this? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Please, don't! 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, look at these! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Eeeheeeheee! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon! 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, Cranky.  I promised not to touch your wagon, so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Who'd'a guessed? 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe we can be wagon buddies! Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it...  
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  Let's get this over with. 
    Pinkie Pie That's the spirit! 

    

        Welcome welcome welcome 
        A fine welcome to you 
        Welcome welcome welcome 
        I say how do you do? 
        Welcome welcome welcome 
        I say hip hip hurray 
        Welcome welcome welcome 
        To Ponyville today 

    Pinkie Pie Wait for it! 
     
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Noooo! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again!  Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Oh, where is it, where is it? 
    Pinkie Pie Where's what?  Spider! Big hairy spider! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Stop, stop, stop! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. Was that your wig? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
    Pinkie Pie I can fix this, I can fix this!  Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?! 
    Ponies  
    Pinkie Pie This donkey is really, really, bald! 
    Ponies  
    Pinkie Pie  What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I have had enough! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No! 
    Pinkie Pie Please! Oh, please please please...  

    Pinkie Pie Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT. 

    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
    Pinkie Pie Hi, Cranky! I have a gift for you! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey The spa treatment was gift enough. 
    Pinkie Pie It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the "dreamboat special". 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey This is wonderful. Thanks, kid. 
    Pinkie Pie He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm. 

    Pinkie Pie Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey What's it look like? 
    Pinkie Pie Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this! 
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I'm not selling, kid. I'm unpacking. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, why didn't you say so? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I thought I had. 
    Pinkie Pie This is so pretty! Where'd you get it? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Manehattan. Now put it down, gently. 
    Pinkie Pie Really? What were you doin' there? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Trying to find a friend. 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey This was a special friend. 
    Pinkie Pie Like me? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No, you're extra special, kid. 
    Pinkie Pie  Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Fillydelphia. 
    Pinkie Pie It's awfully pretty. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Yes, she was. 
    Pinkie Pie Huh? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I mean, it wasâ€“ I mean, it is. Yes, it's pretty. Now put it down! 
    Pinkie Pie I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you aboutâ€“ 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh no! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey What did you say-ayayayayay! What have you done?! 
    Pinkie Pie There! Uh, all better? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No, not all better, all soggy! 
    Pinkie Pie I'm sorry, Cranky! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Oh, you're sorry! Well, then, everything is fine! 
    Pinkie Pie ...It is? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No! It isn't! Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend! 
    Pinkie Pie Never, or never-ever? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Never, ever, ever, ever, ever! 
     
    Pinkie Pie That's four 'evers'. That's like... forever! 

    Pinkie Pie I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow! 
    Pinkie Pie No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology! 

    Pinkie Pie Cranky! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No! No! Leave me alone! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No, I don't! 
    Pinkie Pie So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Fine! You said it! 
    Pinkie Pie But do you accept my apology? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No! 
    Pinkie Pie But I'm really, really, really... 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
    Pinkie Pie ...really, really... 
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Phew! 
    Pinkie Pie ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really, really...  ...sorry! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey But there's nothing you can do! You ruined my book! You destroyed all I have to remember her by! 
    Pinkie Pie Her? Her who? The special friend? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Go away, Pinkie!  
     
    Pinkie Pie  Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey No, I don't want it, kid! Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster! 
    Matilda  Goodness, you really are cranky. 
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey It can't be... Is it really you? 
    Matilda It can, and it is. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Matilda! But how? 
    Matilda Pinkie. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey But... I never told you about her! 
    Pinkie Pie You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey What? 
    Pinkie Pie Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey But how could you have ever seen them before? 
    Matilda Because I also have them in my scrapbook. 
    Pinkie Pie And I'd seen them in Matilda's book! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life. 

     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone. 
    Matilda  Didn't you get my note? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you... 

    Cranky Doodle Donkey ...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search. 
    Matilda I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle. 
    Pinkie Pie Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm. 
    Matilda Oh, Doodle, I'm so happy to see you.  
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
    Pinkie Pie So does this mean that you accept my apology? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend. 
    Pinkie Pie  party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. Um, but we're still friends? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends. 
    Pinkie Pie Great! 

    Pinkie Pie Dear Princess Celestia, 
    There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile. 

    

        He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart 
        She's his cranky doodle joy 
        I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah! 
        I helped the Cranky Doodle boy! 

    Cranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoops, privacy. Sorry. 

     

Putting Your Hoof Down

     
    Fluttershy Lunch time! Who's hungry? 
     
    Fluttershy Plenty for everypony. Slow down, sweetie.  
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Here you go, Angel bunny. 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum! 
     
    Fluttershy What? But... Well then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece ofâ€“ 
     
    Fluttershy  I'll make your special recipe. 

     

    Fluttershy Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first andâ€“ 
    Lucy Packard Sorry, didn't notice you there. 
    Fluttershy I know. 
    "Geri"  
    Fluttershy Oh, pardon me, sirâ€“ 
    "Geri" Yes, what? 
    Fluttershy I think you just cut in front of me. 
    "Geri" A cut of celery? Butâ€“ this is the asparagus stand! 
    Fluttershy I said  I think you just cut in front of me. 
    "Geri" Ohoh, no need, dearie, I'm already in front! 
    Fluttershy I noticed. 
    "Turf"  ...And I was like, 'Oh, wow.' 
    Fluttershy Hey! 
    "Turf" Would you mind moving back? You're in my personal space. 
    Fluttershy Butâ€“ 
    "Surf" Seriously, do you need your asparagus so badly? Get a life. 
    Fluttershy Oh, okay. There's no rush. 
    Rarity Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way. 
    Fluttershy Oh, it's-it's really no big deal... 
    Pinkie Pie It's bigger than big. It's double big. You are a pony with a problem. 
    Fluttershy What problem? Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie. You first. 
    Pinkie Pie Right there! That's the problem. 
    Rarity You've got to stop being such a doormat. 
    Fluttershy A doormat? 
    Rarity A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us. 
    Fluttershy Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, that's okay, I don't mind. 
    Rarity Watch and learn. Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome. 
    Gizmo Uh, who, me? 
    Rarity Oh, of course you. Nopony ever called you handsome before? 
    Gizmo Uhh, that'd be a big no. 
    Rarity Oh, well, they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me?  Oh, my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus? 
     
    Gizmo  Nuhh. 
    Rarity See, that's not so hard, is it? 
    Fluttershy Um... I guess not. 
    Rarity Alright then! What else is on your list? 
    Fluttershy Let's see... I also need tomatoes. 

     
    Fluttershy Here you go. 
    "Roma"  That'll be two bits. Not one. 
    Fluttershy Oh, but last week, it was only one bit. 
    "Roma" That was then, this is now. 
    Fluttershy Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it. 
    Pinkie Pie What do you think you're doing? 
    "Roma" Mindin' my own business, maybe you should try it. 
    Pinkie Pie Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous. One bit is the right price. 
    "Roma" I say it's two bits. 
    Pinkie Pie One bit. 
    "Roma" Two bits! 
    Pinkie Pie One bit! 
    "Roma" Two bits! 
    Pinkie Pie One bit! 
    "Roma" Two bits! 
    Pinkie Pie Two bits! 
    "Roma" One bit! 
    Pinkie Pie Two bits! 
    "Roma" One bit! 
    Pinkie Pie I insist it's two bits or nothing! 
    "Roma" One bit and that's my final offer! 
    Pinkie Pie Have it your way, one bit it is! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie See? Asserting yourself can be fun! 
    Fluttershy I guess you're right! 
    Rarity So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try? 
    Fluttershy Um... okay.  Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left. You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel. He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top. 
     
    Fluttershy Here you go. 
    Crafty Crate So, you say you need this cherry 'very badly'. 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it! 
    Crafty Crate Then it'll be ten bits! 
    Fluttershy Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right? 
    Crafty Crate Ten bits for the cherry. 
    Fluttershy Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits! 
    Crafty Crate Eleven bits? 
    Fluttershy Umm...I mean, nine bits! 
    Crafty Crate Er, now wait a minute. 
    Fluttershy Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer! 
    Crafty Crate I think you're confused. 
    Fluttershy It's twelve bits, take it or leave it. 
    Crafty Crate Okay, I'll take it! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits! 
    Fluttershy But... I was only doing what you did. 
    Rarity It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away. 
    Fluttershy But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs! 
    Crafty Crate In that case, twenty bits! 
    Fluttershy Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much! 
    Crafty Crate Then why're you wasting my time? 
    Lemon Hearts I'll give you two bits for that cherry! 
    Crafty Crate Sold! Eh, tough break, kid. Next time, don't be such a doormat. 

     
    Fluttershy Ta-da! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel?  Look at me... I really am a doormat. "The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre." As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again! 

     
    Fluttershy Oh! Ah! Uh... excuse me!  
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Iron Will  Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will, and today is the first day of your new life! I wanna hear you stomp if you're tired of being a pushover! 
     
    Iron Will Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat! 
     
    Iron Will Stomp if you wanna pay nothing for this seminar! 
     
    Iron Will That's no joke, friends. Iron Will is so confident that you will be one hundred percent satisfied with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques, that if you are not one hundred percent satisfied, you. Pay. Nothing. But I pity the fool who doubts Iron Will's methods! You don't doubt me, do you? 
    Meadow Song Uh-uh, no sir... 
    Ponies  
    Iron Will That, my friends, is your first lesson. "Don't be shy; look 'em in the eye." 
     
    Iron Will Now, to demonstrate that Iron Will's techniques will work for anypony, I'm gonna need a volunteer. 
     
    Iron Will You in the back row! 
    Fluttershy Who, me? 
    Iron Will Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage! 
    Fluttershy  Uh, well... 
    Iron Will Now! 
    Fluttershy  Okay. 
    Iron Will Whoaa! He's blocking your path. What are you gonna do about it? 
    Fluttershy Um, politely walk around him? 
    Iron Will No. 
    Fluttershy Gingerly tip-toe around him? 
    Iron Will No! 
    Fluttershy Go back home and try again tomorrow? 
    Iron Will No! "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!" 
    Fluttershy Oh! Sorry. 
    Iron Will Don't be sorry! Be assertive! "Never apologize when you can criticize."  why don't you watch where you're going!? Now, you try. 
    Fluttershy Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won't be sorry when I do! 
     
    Iron Will You see my friends!? If my techniques can work for this shy, little pony, then they can work for anypony! 
     

    Fluttershy Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to "attack the day", as Iron Will says. 
     
    Mr. Greenhooves  
    Fluttershy Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias... 
    Mr. Greenhooves  
    Fluttershy ...again. 
    Mr. Greenhooves Let the professional handle it.  
    Fluttershy "Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over." 
    Mr. Greenhooves Hm? Hmm...  Well, perhaps that is enough water. 
    Fluttershy Thank you.  I can't believe it worked! 

    Cherry Berry Showpony business is tough. 
    Sweetie Drops Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me. I laugh at everything. 
    Cherry Berry Okay, okay, okay. A donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island... 
    Fluttershy  Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass? 
    Cherry Berry Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story. And so the donkey says to the muleâ€“ 
    Fluttershy A-hemmmm, can you move? You're blocking my path. 
    Cherry Berry Yeah yeah, in a minute! So the donkey says to the mule...  (Why don't we build a boat to get off this island?) 
    Fluttershy "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!" 
    Cherry Berry ...and the mule saysâ€“ 
     
    Cherry Berry Ugh! Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay? 
    Fluttershy Good! 

    Pinkie Pie Who's next please? And what can I get for you today? 
    Fluttershy What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me? 
    Shoeshine Uh, I guess maybe. 
    Fluttershy 'Maybe'? "Maybes are for babies!"  Now go to the back of the line where you belong! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Heyyy, look at you! 
    Rarity Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous. 
    Pinkie Pie Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off! 
    Fluttershy Iron Will's not a monster. He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work. 
    Rarity Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some?  
    Fluttershy "You laugh at me, I wrath at you!" 
     
    Fluttershy Bye, girls. What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. "Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!" 
     
    Royal Riff Aieeeeee! Ow... 
    Fluttershy Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!  Nopony! 
    Pinkie Pie Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all. 
    Rarity Old Rarity agrees. 

    Fluttershy You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again! 
    "Mr. Zippy" Ohâ€“ 
    Fluttershy And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage. 
    "Mr. Zippy" Ohh, did I mix 'em up again? Sorry about that. 
    Fluttershy "You apologize, I penalize!" 
     
    "Mr. Zippy" Oh! 
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Globe Trotter Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower? 
    Fluttershy  
    Globe Trotter Oh, that's a shame. 
    Fluttershy  "You make me lose, I blow my fuse!" 
    Globe Trotter Hey! 
     
    Rarity Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave! 
    Fluttershy Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover! 
    Rarity No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far. 
    Fluttershy What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone! 
    Pinkie Pie New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!? 
    Rarity What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back. 
    Fluttershy No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy! 
    Pinkie Pie Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershys to keep track of! Make it stop! 
    Fluttershy Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie? 
    Rarity Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults! 
    Fluttershy Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion. 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion! 
    Fluttershy Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about! 
    Pinkie Pie  Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay! 
    Rarity  I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity  
    Fluttershy Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!  I'm the monster. 

     
     
    Rarity  Fluttershy, are you in there? 
    Pinkie Pie It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity! 
    Fluttershy  Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again! 
    Rarity Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret. 
    Pinkie Pie We did? 
    Rarity Shh. 
    Fluttershy  But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away. 
    Rarity  Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony. 
    Rarity Yes!  You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it. 
    Fluttershy I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster. 
     
    Rarity Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster. 
    Pinkie Pie No, but he is. 
    Iron Will Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game. 
     
    Rarity What a darling little catchphrase. 
    Iron Will Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases. Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony! So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee. 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep! 
    Rarity  I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monsterâ€“ I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later. 
    Iron Will Are you kidding? Fluttershy is overdue as it is. Iron Will collects now. 
     
    Rarity Do something! 
     
    Pinkie Pie We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya? 
    Iron Will Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do. Iron Will will come back this afternoon. 
    Pinkie Pie But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least. 
    Iron Will Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer! 
    Pinkie Pie A full day! 
    Iron Will Half day! 
    Pinkie Pie Full day! 
    Iron Will Half day! 
    Pinkie Pie Half day! 
    Iron Will Full day! 
    Pinkie Pie We need half a day and no more! 
    Iron Will Well, you'll get a full day and no less! 
    Pinkie Pie Okie-dokie. See you tomorrow. 
    Iron Will Wait, what? 
    Fluttershy  
    Iron Will Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary. Iron Will collects now. 
    Pinkie Pie But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow! 
    Iron Will "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!" 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
     
    Iron Will Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy!  
     
    Iron Will  You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine! Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will! 
    Fluttershy Um, no. 
     
    Iron Will What did you say? 
    Fluttershy No. 
    Iron Will Ohhh, I'd hate to be you right now, because Iron Will is gonna to rain down a world of hurt unless Iron Will gets his money pronto!  
    Fluttershy As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied. 
    Iron Will What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied! 
    Fluttershy Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that. 
     
    Iron Will Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we? 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, but no means no. 
    Iron Will No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop. 
     
    Pinkie Pie You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster! 
    Rarity In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved! 
    Pinkie Pie The one we missed! 
    Fluttershy Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends? 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity Friends. 
    Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rarity  

    Fluttershy Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean. 

     
     

It's About Time

    Spike  I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage... 
     
    Spike Huh? Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, hi, Spike! 
    Spike It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this? 
    Twilight Sparkle Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this! 
    Spike Three A.M.? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic! 
    Spike Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong? 
    Twilight Sparkle Here. Now do you see what's wrong? 
    Spike We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off! 
    Spike And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this... 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read "The Art of Invisibility Spells" and "Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on?  
    Future Twilight Sparkle Twilight, you've got to listen to me! 
    Twilight Sparkle Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible! 
    Future Twilight Sparkle Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're from the future?! 
    Future Twilight Sparkle That's right, now listenâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle What happened to you? The future must be awful. 
    Future Twilight Sparkle Please! I don't have much time! 
    Twilight Sparkle Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something? 
    Future Twilight Sparkle Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now! 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out? 
    Future Twilight Sparkle The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's notâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? Where? I've never seen them. 
    Future Twilight Sparkle They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen toâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questionsâ€“  
    Future Twilight Sparkle I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don'tâ€“ 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... Oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I will be...  

    Pinkie Pie C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there! 
    Fluttershy  Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say! 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves! 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle I've just been visited by myself from the future! 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning! 
    Applejack What kind of disaster? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain! 
    Pinkie Pie Run for your liiiiiiiife! 
    Rarity What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is? 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything. 
    Rainbow Dash You got it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony elseâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria! 

     

     
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest? 
    Applejack The perimeter's clear. 
    Twilight Sparkle Great. 
    Rainbow Dash And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus. 
    Twilight Sparkle Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, everypony, follow my lead.  
    Ponies  
    Spike What is that thing?! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria! 
    Spike Destroy Equestria?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Fluttershy Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog? 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing! 
    Fluttershy Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie  Yes, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Do you have a ball I can borrow? 
    Pinkie Pie I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster. 

     
    Spike  I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks. 
     
    Spike Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus? 
    Twilight Sparkle Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape. 
    Spike Hurrh... huâ€“  
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh no! 
    Spike What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not that, it's this! 
    Spike A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine. 
    Twilight Sparkle The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming! 

    Twilight Sparkle If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be? 
    Spike  I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious! 
    Spike My lectures? 
    Twilight Sparkle I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do! 
    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do! 
    Spike Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream! 
     
    Spike Mmm!  
    Twilight Sparkle  Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache! 
    Spike  Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear andâ€“  What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him? 
    Spike She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening! 
    Rainbow Dash  Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you! 
    Rainbow Dash and Spike  
    Spike Wait, wait, wait, let me try! Whoa-oaâ€“  
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh no! 
    Twilight Sparkle What happened? 
    Spike I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident! 
    Twilight Sparkle Show me. 
    Rainbow Dash Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's aâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight! 
    Rainbow Dash Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad... 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it! 
    Spike You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help! 

    Twilight Sparkle What's this? 
    Spike It's Madame Pinkie's place. 
    Twilight Sparkle Madame Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie  Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, uh... best one I've seen. 
    Pinkie Pie  Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year... 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, and? 
    Pinkie Pie That's it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you sure? 
    Pinkie Pie Yep. Cool birthday present. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Like that, see? Where did that even come from? 

    Pinkie Pie Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon... 
    Spike Hey Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she? 
    Spike Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike. 
    Pinkie Pie  Are... you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes? 
    Pinkie Pie Sure! 
    Twilight Sparkle So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my headâ€”see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future... 
    Pinkie Pie Nice! 
    Twilight Sparkle I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything. 
    Pinkie Pie Makes sense to me! 
    Twilight Sparkle That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong! 
    Pinkie Pie Three hours? But when did you sleep? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that! 
    Spike You've been awake too long, Twilight. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes? 
    Pinkie Pie I have no idea! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ah! My eye! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut. 
    Twilight Sparkle The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move! 
    Spike Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot. 
    Twilight Sparkle  That was close. 
    Spike I dunno why we have to wear these things, either. 
    Pinkie Pie Aren't we wearing them for fun? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, there's nothing fun about this! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh... Are you sure? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around! 
    Pinkie Pie Awesome! That sounds fun! 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, it's not fun! 
    Pinkie Pie Aww. 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present. 

    Twilight Sparkle  The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we canâ€“ AH! 
    Spike  Let's get this over with. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here. 
    Spike Uh, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle  What is it, Spike? 
    Spike Isn't this where we came in? 
    Pinkie Pie Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now? 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing? 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined! 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, the guard! 
    Twilight Sparkle  What do we do, what do we do?! 
    Guard Hey, Twilight, haven't seen you in a while. Let me open that for ya. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Thanks! 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! 
     
    Spike Oof! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true! 
    Pinkie Pie And that's bad, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment! 
    Spike But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here! 
    Twilight Sparkle I. Don't. Know! 
     
    Spike Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning. 
    Twilight Sparkle Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming! 
    Spike I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day. 
    Princess Celestia Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?! 
    Spike I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you? 
    Twilight Sparkle  I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous. 
    Spike and Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Yeah, you do! 
    Twilight Sparkle And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing! 
    Spike That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing? 
    Twilight Sparkle No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this. 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help? 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, you're a genius! 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Twilight, you've got to listen to me! 
    Past Twilight Sparkle Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible! 
    Twilight Sparkle Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future! 
    Past Twilight Sparkle You're from the future?! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's right, now listenâ€“ 
    Past Twilight Sparkle What happened to you? The future must be awful. 
    Twilight Sparkle Please! I don't have much time! 
    Past Twilight Sparkle Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something? 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now! 
    Past Twilight Sparkle I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out? 
    Twilight Sparkle The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's notâ€“ 
    Past Twilight Sparkle Really? Where? I've never seen them. 
    Twilight Sparkle They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen toâ€“ 
    Past Twilight Sparkle Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questionsâ€“  
    Twilight Sparkle I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don'tâ€“ 
     

    Twilight Sparkle â€“waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that! 
    Pinkie Pie Did you tell her about the cool birthday present? 
    Twilight Sparkle Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh... 
    Pinkie Pie Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie. 
    Spike  Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh... 
    Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home. 

     
     

Dragon Quest

     
    Twilight Sparkle C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun! 
    Fluttershy There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that? 
    Fluttershy Now that you put it that way, yes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out. 
    Fluttershy Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well... yeah! 
    Fluttershy Thanks, but... no thanks! 
    Rainbow Dash Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me! 
    Fluttershy I... said... no! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeaagh! Ugh! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle  I don't see any dragons. 
    Applejack  Me neither. 
    Pinkie Pie Me neither neither. 
    Rainbow Dash Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves! 
    Rarity Yoo-hoo! Well? 
     
     
    Rarity What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what? 
    Applejack  You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us? 
    Rarity Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab? 
    Pinkie Pie  Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho! 
    Main cast Oooh... Ahhhh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, amazing! 
    Rainbow Dash Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got? 
     
    Applejack  What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame? 
    Rainbow Dash  Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind. 
    Rarity  And 'formidable'. 
    Pinkie Pie  And 'super-duper scary'! 
    Spike Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with. 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen! 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Spike What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales. Feathers. That's one tough stain! 
    Rainbow Dash One tough stain against one lame dragon.  
    Rarity You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons. 
    Twilight Sparkle Or act like them. 
    Rarity My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is. 
    Spike I don't act like other dragons? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, not even close! 
    Applejack But why would you want to, Spike? 
    Rarity Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of. 
    Spike What's that? 
    Rarity The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo! 
    Spike Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right? 
    Rarity Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming. 
    Spike Rrrgh! 
    Rarity Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger? 
    Spike Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh! 

    Spike What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you. 
    Spike Seriously? That's all you know? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Spike. 
    Spike That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out. 
    Spike Really? You'd do that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! I'm sure we can find something. 

    Twilight Sparkle Nothing. Nothing in this one either! 
    Spike Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study! 
    Spike I wonder if dragons cry... 
    Twilight Sparkle Aw, Spike. 
    Spike It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do! 
    Rarity Yoo-hoo! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, guys! 
    Spike Waugh! 
    Rarity Good morning! 
    Rainbow Dash Ya wanna join us for breakfast? 
    Twilight Sparkle That sounds great. I'm famished. 
    Spike Count me out. I've gotta get an early start! 
    Rarity An early start? 
    Spike Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration! 
    Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash What?!? 
    Rainbow Dash Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary... 
    Spike And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them. 
    Rainbow Dash All I'm saying is that you could get hurt. 
    Rarity Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head! 
    Spike I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind. 
    Rarity Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late! 
    Spike Ngh! Hey! Give it back! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hold it! 
    Spike Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Aaagh! 
    Spike Really? 
    Rainbow Dash Don't tell me you think he should go? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you. 
    Rarity I suppose not. 
    Rainbow Dash I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things. 
    Rarity, Spike and Twilight Sparkle We know. 
    Rainbow Dash  Rrgh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, we hope your tripâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Quest. 
    Rainbow Dash â€“your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?" questions. 
    Spike Thanks, everypony. I know it will. 
    Rarity Goodbye, Spikey-wikey! 
    Rainbow Dash Go get 'em, big guy! 
    Twilight Sparkle We have faith in you! 
    Rarity  We're following him, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Of course. 

     

     

     

     

    Spike Ugh! 

    Spike Nngh... 
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon! 
    Rarity Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations. 
    Twilight Sparkle Shh!  We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go! 
     
    Spike Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike. 
    Fume You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?! 
     
    Spike No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that... 
    "Clump" You look more like Peewee to me. 
     
    Garble Hey guys, c'mon, seriously. Leave him alone or he might fly away. That is, uh, if he had any wings!  
     
    "Clump" You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration? 
    Spike Not exactly... 
    Fume No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched? I bet he still sucks his claw at night! 
    Spike No, I haven't sucked my claw in months! 
     
    Garble Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before? 
    Spike Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville andâ€“ 
    Garble Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony! 
    Spike Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar! 
    Garble Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume. 
     
    Fume A pony in a dragon costume...!  
    Twilight Sparkle  Aheh... yeah... hilarious. 
    Spike Nnh, I am a real dragon! 
    Garble Oh, yeah? Prove it. 
    Spike Well... how? 
    Garble By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest? 
     
    "Fizzle"  
    Fume  
    "Clump"  
     
    "Clump"  
    Garble You think you can beat that, Peewee? 
    Spike  
    Teenage dragons Huh? 
    Garble From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please teâ€“ Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important! 
    Rainbow Dash We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, I know! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way! 
    Garble Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed. 
    Spike Uh... 
    Teenage dragons Yeah! 

    Garble Ready... go! 
    Vex and "Baff"  
    Garble The winner! 
     
    Spike Good old tail wrestling... 
    Rarity We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered! 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's go!  I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle! 
    Garble Who's this weirdo? 
    Fume I think he's Crackle's cousin. 
    Crackle BWAAGH! 
    Garble Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go! 
    Spike  
    Garble Spike's the winner! 
     
    Garble Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all! 
    Spike Yeah! Maybe I am! 
    Rarity Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow. 
    Spike Alright, who's next? 
    Garble Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go! 
    Spike Whooooooooa! 

    Garble So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you? 
    Spike But... I get an A for effort? 
    Garble Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest. 
    Spike Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof! 
     
    Garble King of the hoard! 
     
    Spike This is my chance. 
    Fume  
    Rainbow Dash Not so fast! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oof! 
     
    "Clump" and Garble Whoa! 
    Spike King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof! 
    Garble Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too. 
    Spike  

    Garble Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo! 
     
    Spike Nuh! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Spike's on his own this time. 
     
    "Clump" Cannonball! 
    Spike Guh! 
    Garble What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide? 
     
    Spike  
     
    Teenage dragons Oooh... 
    Spike Ugh... Was I... that bad? 
    Garble No, dude. That was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that!  You're one tough little dragon. 
    Teenage dragons  

    "Baff"  
    Garble Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh.  Now let's party dragon style! 
     

     
    Spike Man, was that a great party. 
    Garble Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon. 
    Spike I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever. 
    Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle Forever?! 

    Spike  
    Rarity Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no, this is terrible! 
    Rainbow Dash I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go! 
    Garble Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid. 
     
    Garble There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em! 
    "Clump" Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid? 
    Spike Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched. 
    Garble Alright then. Let's fly! 
    Spike Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them! 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly! 
    Rarity And you're ruining my fabulous costume! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it! 

    Garble Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest. 
    Spike Heh... Lucky me... 
    Garble Well go on, then! 
    Spike Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually... 
    Garble  We haven't got all day, Spike! 
    Spike Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me! 
     
    Spike  
    Garble What the... 
     
    Fume The eggs have hatched. 
    "Clump" What do we do now? 
    Garble We take the hatchlings, of course! 
     
     
    Garble Get 'em! 

    Spike  
     
    Garble Ohh... Get them! 
     
    Garble  Nnnghh... 
    Teenage dragons Ugh! 
    Garble Nnngh, they got away! I hate that! 
     
    Teenage dragons Oof! 

    Spike Huh, what have we got here? What happened? 
    Garble They got away! Hey! You stole an egg? 
    Spike Uh... 
    Garble Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all. 
     
    Garble Nice going, Spike. 
    "Clump" Well, what are you waiting for, Spike? Smash it! 
    Spike Smash the egg? 
    "Clump" Yeah! 
    Fume Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can! 
    Teenage dragons Yeah! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! 
    Spike No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it! 
    Garble What did you say? 
    Spike I said no. 
    Garble No one says no to me.  
    Rainbow Dash Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's right! 
    Rarity Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head! 
     
    Garble Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends? 
    Spike Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons. 
    Garble Oh, yeah?  What's that? 
    Spike Run away! 
    Garble  
    Twilight Sparkle Nyuh! 
     

    Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Spike and Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys. 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course. What are friends for? 
    Spike You're more than friends. You're my family. 
    Rarity  

    Spike Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family. 

    Yours truly, 
    Spike 

     
     
    Spike Aww.  Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony. 

     
     

Hurricane Fluttershy

    Rainbow Dash Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight! 
    Flitter  "Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi." 
    Rainbow Dash Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense. 
    Mule None taken. 

    Rainbow Dash All right, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go. 

     

     
     
    Film announcer Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria. But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water? Tornado power! That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power. A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado, powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale. Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale. So, the next time you're wondering "Where does all that extra rainwater come from?", just rememâ€“ 
     
    Pegasi  
    Spike Uh... intermission? 
    Rainbow Dash So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale. 
    Pegasi  
    Rainbow Dash Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand! 
    Pegasi  
    Rainbow Dash ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up. 
    Thunderlane  
    Rainbow Dash That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard? 
    Pegasi Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash Are we gonna be strong? 
    Pegasi Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash Are we gonna be fast? 
    Pegasi Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash Record-smashing fast? 
    Bulk Biceps YEAH! 
    Rainbow Dash Who's with me? 
    Pegasi Woo-hoo!  
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy! 

    Rainbow Dash Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed!  Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record! 
    Bulk Biceps YEAH!  
    Rainbow Dash Good work, everypony!  Everypony except Fluttershy. 

    Rainbow Dash  Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, openâ€“ 
    Fluttershy Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash.  
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy, what happened to you? 
    Fluttershy Oh, I  
    Rainbow Dash Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox. 
    Fluttershy I know, plenty of bedâ€“ 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up. 
    Fluttershy Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better.  I'll just get out of these robes andâ€“ ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after allâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on? 
    Fluttershy Well, y'see, uh, well... Oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly! 
    Rainbow Dash What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground! 
    Fluttershy But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me! 
    Rainbow Dash It wasn't that bad. 
    Fluttershy You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible! 

    Filly Fluttershy  
    Fluttershy  The other foals used to tease me, a lot! 
    Foals  

    Fluttershy I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again. 
    Rainbow Dash Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time forâ€“ I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash... 
    Rainbow Dash  Thanks anyway. 
    Fluttershy Wait. I'll do it. 
    Rainbow Dash You will? 
    Fluttershy I will. 
    Rainbow Dash You're game? 
    Fluttershy I'm game. 
    Rainbow Dash Alright! 

     
    Cloudchaser What exactly does this machine do? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions? 
    Flitter Yeah.  What exactly does this machine do? 
    Spike It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are. 
    Pegasi Ohhhh... Okay... I see... 
    Pegasus  
    Twilight Sparkle Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment. 
    Thunderlane It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth. 
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane? 
    Blossomforth  
    Thunderlane  
     
    Twilight Sparkle We have 9.3 wing power. 
    Pegasi Wow! That's fast! 
    Bulk Biceps YEAH! 
    Rainbow Dash Not bad, not bad.  
     
    Twilight Sparkle 16.5 wing power! 
    Pegasi  
    Rainbow Dash Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one! 
    Pegasi  

     
    Rainbow Dash Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn.  
    "Tornado Bolt"  
    Fluttershy  
    Flitter and Cloudchaser  
    Foals  Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Tell her! 
    Rainbow Dash  No, you tell her! 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, you! 
    Rainbow Dash Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5. 
    Spike .5? Isn't that like... less than one? 
     
    Spike Ow! 
    Foals  
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you? 
    Fluttershy  Yes! 
    Rainbow Dash But I need you! 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just  don't have the courage right now... 

    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy  Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem. 
     
    Fluttershy I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me... 
     
    Fluttershy I know it's important to have confidence in myself... 
     
    Fluttershy Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling... 
     
    Fluttershy ...and you were scared... 
     
    Fluttershy ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer! 
     

     
    Angel  
     
     
    Angel  
     
     
     
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday. 
    Rainbow Dash This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record! 
     
    Spike What did he say? 
    Twilight Sparkle Do I look like I speak squirrel? 
    Spike What's that? 
     
     
    Fluttershy 2.3? 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement! 
    Rainbow Dash You did awesome, Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow! 
    Rainbow Dash So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts! 
    Fluttershy How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5? 
    Spike Actually, it was only 2.3, andâ€“ ow! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Well, uh... I'd feel... um... 
    Fluttershy Exactly! Humiliated!  I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! 
    Spike It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale! 
    Rainbow Dash  If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Are we ready to do this? 
    Pegasi Yeah!  
    Spike Look! 
    Rainbow Dash Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother? 
    Rumble He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital. 
    Spike But he's not the only one. 

    Twilight Sparkle Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu...  Oh no! 
    Rainbow Dash Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record? 
    Twilight Sparkle No... 
    Rainbow Dash Phew! 
    Twilight Sparkle ...You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale! 
    Spike Well, should we pack up? 
    Rainbow Dash No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  
     
     
    Spike You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power? 
    Twilight Sparkle I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Seven hundred and fifty wing power! 
    Fluttershy Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy! What are you doing here?! 
    Fluttershy I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support! 
    Twilight Sparkle She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu! 
    Fluttershy Oh no! That's terrible news! 
     
     
    Pegasi Whoa!  
     
    Rainbow Dash Yaaâ€“ oof! 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you okay? 
    Rainbow Dash  I'm fine! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Rbbbbâ€“ We've got to try again! 
    Twilight Sparkle But you've pushed your crew to their limit already! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe! 
    Rainbow Dash No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen! 
    Pegasi  
    Bulk Biceps YEAH! 
    Spike  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred! 
    Rainbow Dash Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster! 
    Twilight Sparkle Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power! 
    Spike  They fell apart right after this! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm too nervous to look! 
    Rainbow Dash C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through! 
    Twilight Sparkle Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there! 
    Fluttershy I won't make a difference! 
    Twilight Sparkle You can make a difference! 
    Fluttershy My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little! 
    Spike It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em! 
    Twilight Sparkle Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself! 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number! 
    Foals  
    Fluttershy No! 
    "Serenity" What was that? 
    "Slipstream" I think it was Fluttershy! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle She did it! She did it! They all did it! 
    Spike  
    Pegasi  
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, girl, take it easy! 
    Fluttershy Whuh, what? Did we do it? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, we did it! You did it! 
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Ah! 
    Flitter Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome! 
    Cloudchaser Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you. 
    Spitfire Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts. 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy! 
    Pegasi  

    Fluttershy Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen. 

     

     
     

Ponyville Confidential

     
     
    Sweetie Belle Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us! 
     
    Snips Great cutie mark, Featherweight! 
    Snails  Looking good! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
    Sweetie Belle I give up... 
    Apple Bloom I've got it! The answer to all our problems! 
    Sweetie Belle The Foal Free Press? How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks? 
    Apple Bloom  
    Granny Smith Move your caboose! 
    Apple Bloom Uh-oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run! 
    Scootaloo Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea. 
    Sweetie Belle Guess it's worth a shot... 

     

     

    Sweetie Belle Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust. 
    Scootaloo We tried everything, from papier-mÃ¢chÃ© to making birds' nests, and nothing worked. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle What's so funny? 
    Apple Bloom What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  

     

    Cheerilee Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now! 
    Apple Bloom Cutie marks in journalism! 
    Scootaloo Such a good idea. 
    Cheerilee Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last yearâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh! 
    Cheerilee Yes? 
    Sweetie Belle What's an editor-in-chief? 
    Cheerilee Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporters' instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year! 
     
    Students Diamond Tiara?! 
    Diamond Tiara Hm. 
    Cheerilee I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun! 
     
    Diamond Tiara Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke. 
    Students Huh? 
    Diamond Tiara Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory! 
     
    Truffle Yay! 
    Diamond Tiara First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important. 
     
    Diamond Tiara The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor. 
    "Ruby Pinch" But Namby-Pamby was a great editor. 
    Diamond Tiara Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report! 
    Scootaloo Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again. 
    Sweetie Belle But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief? 
    Scootaloo I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks. 
    Sweetie Belle C'mon! Let's go get these marks! 

    Sweetie Belle  My first story's going to be an exclusive interview. 

    Scootaloo  I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day. I bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that! 
     
     

    Apple Bloom  Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville. 

     
     
    Diamond Tiara I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. "Baby Birds Born"? "Rarity's Hot New Hat"? "Ponyville The Early Years"!? Oh! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news! 
    Sweetie Belle We just... thought... 
    Diamond Tiara Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy! 
    Scootaloo Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story? 
    Apple Bloom Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through. 
     
    Snips Oh! Get it off me, Snails! 
    Snails Eh, you get it off me, Snips? 
    Snips Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great. 
    Snails I'll get it.  
    Snips Aah! 
    Snails Get it off! Get it off! 
    Sweetie Belle  Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story. 

     
    "Noi" "Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils! And that's when the biggest jokester in school really stuck his hoof in it â€“ literally!" 
    "Green Daze" The Foal Free Press is usually just boring news and stuff. 
    Cotton Cloudy So funny! 
    Snips Our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday. 
    Snails Yeah, and look! We finally got the gum out!  

    Diamond Tiara Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! "Gabby Gums"...  That was a stroke of genius! 
    Sweetie Belle We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us. 
    Diamond Tiara Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls. 
    Scootaloo But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip. 
    Sweetie Belle If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Woo-hoo! 

    Sweetie Belle Scootaloo? Do you have anything? 
    Scootaloo Nope. 
    Sweetie Belle Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom  Sorry. 
    Scootaloo Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school. 
    Snips and Snails  
     
    Sweetie Belle We're doomed. 

     
    Rarity Ohh, Sweetie Belle... Was she raised in a barn or something?  Too rich! 
    Sweetie Belle Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying toâ€“ hey! 
    Rarity Bleh! I, I was justâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle Are you snooping through my saddlebag? 
     
    Sweetie Belle How dare you! 
    Rarity Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny! 
    Sweetie Belle You actually like the school paper? 
    Rarity It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends? 
    Sweetie Belle Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press? 
    Rarity Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a newâ€“ 

    Sweetie Belle We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand! 
     
    Apple Bloom We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville! 
    Sweetie Belle We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime. 
    Scootaloo Sweetie Belle, you're a genius! 

    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  

    Diamond Tiara "Pound and Pumpkin Cake Trip to the Store Ends in Tears." Gabby Gums comes through again! 
    Truffle  The Ponyville news stand wants to carry the Foal Free Press! Ponies keep coming by and asking for it! 
    Diamond Tiara Send 'em twenty copies, and if they run out of those, we'll send 'em twenty more! You three are doing a great job for this paper. Keep those columns coming! 
    Scootaloo This is great! 

     
     

    Rarity Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had! 
    Applejack  You said it, ooh... 
    Spike  I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed. 
    Rainbow Dash You guys! 
    Spike Aaah! 
    Rainbow Dash The new Gabby Gums just came out! "The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!" 
    Rarity We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing. 
    Rainbow Dash  Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet. 
    Spike Well, do it quietly, will ya?  Some of us are trying to unwind! 
    Twilight Sparkle I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean? 
    Applejack She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot! 
    Twilight Sparkle "Celestia Just Like Us"? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy. 
    Rarity Oh, lighten up, Twilight, there's nothing but harmless gossip! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. "Mayor Not Naturally Gray!" The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that? 
    Twilight Sparkle I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing. 
    Rainbow Dash Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper? 
    Rarity Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures? 
    Rainbow Dash It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me. 
    Spike She did one on me. 
    Main cast What?! 
    Spike Aaaah! 

    Apple Bloom "Exclusive! Local Dragon Tells All! Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!" 
    Scootaloo It's our best column yet! 
    Diamond Tiara More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this! 
    Apple Bloom  Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip. 
    Sweetie Belle Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one. 
    Scootaloo Me too. 
    Sweetie Belle If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Awww... 

     
    Applejack "Applejack Asleep on the Job!" Can y'all believe this?! And this one "Big McIntosh â€“ What's He Hiding?" Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Listen to this one. "Twilight Sparkle I Was a Canterlot Snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes." Spike! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle How could you say such a thing? 
    Spike Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that! 
    Rarity Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this. 
    Twilight Sparkle But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants! She doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! "Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions!" "Pinkie Pie is an Out-of-Control Party Animal!" 
    Pinkie Pie What?! It's true! I do have a problem!  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up! 
    Mrs. Cake We are?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Well, my life is officially over. Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale. 
    Twilight Sparkle "Rainbow Dash Speed Demon or Super Softie?"?! 
    Rainbow Dash I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late!  I'm a laughing stock! 
    Twilight Sparkle See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful! 
    Rarity Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they deserâ€“  I'll destroy her! "The Drama-Queen Diaries"... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?! 
    Twilight Sparkle We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is. 
    Rarity  My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovelyâ€“ 

    Rarity â€“most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums? 

    Rarity Et tu, Gabby Gums?! 
    Sweetie Belle  You know?! How'd you find out?! 
    Rarity The gilded pages of your betrayal! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, yeah. 
    Rarity How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you? 
    Sweetie Belle No... 
    Rarity What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel! 
    Sweetie Belle I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly! 
    Rarity Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, when you put it that way... 

    Diamond Tiara No! I won't let you quit! 
    Sweetie Belle But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings! 
    Diamond Tiara Feelings?! I don't care about feelings! Gabby Gums is my bread and butter, and I'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me! 
    Sweetie Belle We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping. 
    Diamond Tiara When you see these... you may not want to quit after all. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Diamond Tiara I told Featherweight to document everything... 
     
    Diamond Tiara ...And that's exactly what he did. 
    Scootaloo  Gimme those! 
    Diamond Tiara Sorry, girls, property of the Foal Free Press. And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums! 

    Sweetie Belle We'll find a way out of this, girls. 
    Scootaloo Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip. 
    Apple Bloom Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums! 
    Sweetie Belle You heard too, huh? 
    Rainbow Dash Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three. 
    Scootaloo Don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you, huh? 
    Rainbow Dash  
     

    Fluttershy  
    Sweetie Belle Oh, hi, Angel. Is Fluttershy home? 
     

    Scootaloo  Hey, what gives? 
    Spike A-ha!  Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field. 

    Apple Bloom Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you? 
    Applejack Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom You're not even gonna talk to us? 
    Applejack Nnope. 
    Big McIntosh You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that. We don't wanna talk to any o' y'all right now so take your little gossip column and your embarrassing photographs and just go away! 

     

    Sweetie Belle We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks! 
    Apple Bloom This is the worst day ever! 
    Scootaloo Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow, our most embarrassing moments are about to be published for everypony to laugh at. 
    Apple Bloom So what do we do? 
    Sweetie Belle I don't know, but we're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something! 

     
    Diamond Tiara That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time. Run these instead. I want this paper on every street corner in Ponyville! 
    "Shady Daze" Yes, ma'am! 
    Sweetie Belle Stop the presses! 
    "Shady Daze" Uh... they haven't started yet. 
    Scootaloo We have a Gabby Gums column! 
    Diamond Tiara Hmph, you're lucky I'm nice. 
     
    Diamond Tiara This better not happen again, or else. 

    Diamond Tiara  "An Open Letter to Ponyville by Gabby Gums"?! What is this?! Ooh, they're not gonna get away with this! I'll publish those photos tomorrow! They messed with the wrong pony! 

    Sweetie Belle To the citizens of Ponyville, 
    For some time now, you've been reading this column to get the latest dirt and the hottest buzz. But this will be my final piece. We want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused. 
    Apple Bloom Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo. 
    Scootaloo As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing. 
    Sweetie Belle From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more. 
    Apple Bloom All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville. 

    Signing off for the very last time, 
    XOXO, Gabby Gums 

    Cheerilee Well, staff, I guess I gave a little too much authority to a first-time editor. I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara, I have to strip you of your title.  
    Diamond Tiara  
    Cheerilee And for the next editor of the Foal Free Press... 
    Diamond Tiara  
    Cheerilee ...here's your new editor-in-chief, Featherweight! 
    Students  
    Diamond Tiara Ugh! Him? But what about me?! 
    "Shady Daze" Here ya go! I've been promoted to staff photographer! 
     
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  

     
     

MMMystery on the Friendship Express

    Pinkie Pie Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition! 
    Mrs. Cake Oh, thank you, Pinkie! 
    Mr. Cake And thanks for transporting it all the way to Canterlot for us. 
    Pinkie Pie Absolutely! It's my honor and Iâ€“ 
    Applejack Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh? 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup...! 
    Pinkie Pie Alrighty then, Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying. 
    Mr. Cake Yes, it took months of planning and testing. 
    Mrs. Cake I would hate for it toâ€“ 
    Big McIntosh  
    Mr. Cake and Mrs. Cake Fall! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see! 
    Mrs. Cake Ahahah, oh... of course, Pinkie. 
    Mr. Cake We never doubted you. 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance.  Better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here. 
    Mr. Cake  
    Pinkie Pie See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in? 

     

     
     
    Pinkie Pie  Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition. 
    Rarity I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely. 
    Applejack Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the "MMMM". 
    Rest of main cast MMMM. 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize. 
    Gustave le Grand Zis is not so, for I, Gustave le Grand, do challenge your crude cake to a duel of delectable delicacies against my exceptionally Exquisite Ã‰clairs! They will undoubtedly strike down all ze competition, winning first prize and crowning me le champion. 
    Donut Joe Not a chance, le Grand. 
    Twilight Sparkle Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville? 
    Donut Joe Picking up the final all-important ingredient for my contest entry, Donutopia! And with these super-sprinkles, my donuts are going to dunk all the other lousy desserts, steal first prize, and make my donut shop famous forever!  
    Mulia Mild Oh, Joe...  
    Pinkie Pie Hello. What's your name? 
    Mulia Mild I am Mulia Mild. Behold, my Chocolate Mousse Moose. It will trample all your treats, be given first prize, and make me the greatest chef in Equestria. 
    Gustave le Grand Madame Mild, you and your mousse moose are mistaken. 
    Donut Joe Your frou-frou Ã©clairs will never defeat my donuts! 
    Pinkie Pie The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win! 
    Mulia Mild Your simple cake could never take my moose.  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep. 
    Donut Joe Hmph. 
    Mulia Mild Nyahh. 
    Gustave le Grand Huh!  
     
    Rainbow Dash  I gotta admit I'm pretty beat. 
    Applejack Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect "MMMM". 
    Rarity MMMM? 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm-hmmm. I know for super sure that "MMMM" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too. 
    Rainbow Dash So... 
    Pinkie Pie So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie... you're overreacting. 
    Applejack Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm. 
    Pinkie Pie But they are! I just know it. 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed. 
    Pinkie Pie I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe. 

    Pinkie Pie Huh? Stop, you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh?! Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Stop, thief! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, are you okay, thief?  

     
    Pinkie Pie  The cake! Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous. 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! 
    Pinkie Pie I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet, Pinkie. Look. 
    Pinkie Pie Look at what? Huh?  

    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack What is it? 
    Rainbow Dash What happened? 
    Pinkie Pie It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been  mutilated! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Now we just need to find out who done it. 
    Twilight Sparkle You mean, who did it. 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly. Who did-done-dood it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate. 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly. 
     
    Pinkie Pie And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. 
    Applejack Uh, you're investigatin'? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues? 
    Pinkie Pie Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is... 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? 
    Pinkie Pie No! 'Cause I know who did it. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, how could you possibly know? 
    Pinkie Pie How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your Ã©clairs lacked flair, Gustave! 

     

    Pinkie Pie Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition. 
    Twilight Sparkle But it makes no sense! 
    Pinkie Pie What do you mean, lowly assistant? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here? 
    Pinkie Pie Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question. 
    Twilight Sparkle And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks! 
    Pinkie Pie Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "MMMM" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe! 

     
    Pinkie Pie  Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane. 
     
     
     
     
     

    Pinkie Pie Crushing the Cakes' chances to win! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy! 
    Donut Joe Hey! 
    Rarity Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo. 
    Pinkie Pie Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant. 
    Twilight Sparkle May be? 
    Pinkie Pie Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie... that moose is a mousse! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM". 
    Twilight Sparkle So you're saying that the culprit is... 
    Pinkie Pie Mulia Mild! 

     
     
     
     

    Pinkie Pie Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her! 
    Mulia Mild  
    Pinkie Pie  I guess you're right... 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you! 
    Pinkie Pie But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "MMMM". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's Ã©clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.  why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched? 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  Now I have no idea who do-doned it! 

    Pinkie Pie This mystery gets more mysterious every minute. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night. 
    Pinkie Pie Huh! You're not accusing me, are you? 
    Twilight Sparkle No! But maybe you saw something that will help us. 
    Pinkie Pie I saw a silhouette in the moonlight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Good... Let's retrace your steps. 

    Pinkie Pie And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Already? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next. 
    Pinkie Pie I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine. But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal. 
    Twilight Sparkle The conductor, huh?  But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie Well... I went back to the dessert car. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? 
    Pinkie Pie The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own. 
    Twilight Sparkle Interesting. Anything else? 
    Pinkie Pie I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud... 
     
    Pinkie Pie ...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh my, what is that? 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle What next Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night. 
    Twilight Sparkle And when you woke up, half the cake was gone? 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly. 
    Twilight Sparkle By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch. 

    Mulia Mild  Why are we all here again? 
    Twilight Sparkle I bet you're wondering why you're all here again. 
    Donut Joe She's good. 
    Twilight Sparkle We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage. 
    Gustave le Grand But how? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this. 
     
    Pinkie Pie A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers. 
    Pinkie Pie No, 'cause he's been dyeing them! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash I-I don't even like cake! 
    Pinkie Pie So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved! 
    Twilight Sparkle Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this. 
    Pinkie Pie So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane! 
    Rainbow Dash I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie So you're wearing a wig? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ow! Cut it out! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy  Oh my. 
    Pinkie Pie You're goin' down, Fluttershy! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today? 
    Rarity  What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Rarity Fine, I'm guilty!  I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake. 
    Fluttershy So did I. 
    Rainbow Dash Aw nuts, so did I. 
    Rarity You just made it sound so delectable. 
    Fluttershy So tasty. 
    Rainbow Dash And boy was it! 
    Rarity I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite. 
    Fluttershy And it was so good. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I just dove right in! 
    Fluttershy But I'm really really sorry. 
    Rarity Terribly sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved. 
    Twilight Sparkle But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods. 
    Pinkie Pie You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well... Yes, I do. Do you? 
    Pinkie Pie Look for clues!  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts? 
    Pinkie Pie I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers! 
     
    Pinkie Pie First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has Ã©clair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles! 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you say, bakers? 
    Gustave le Grand Oh, I am so sorry, Mulia, but Pinkie made your mousse moose sound... trÃ¨s magnifique. 
    Donut Joe And Pinkie's description of your Ã©clairs really did make 'em sound scrumptious. 
    Mulia Mild And the way she spoke of your Donutopia, ohh, was too delectable to resist. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved. 
    Gustave le Grand Yes, but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest! 
    Pinkie Pie I think we can fix that. Come on! 

    Pinkie Pie Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts. 

    Pinkie Pie How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia? 
    Twilight Sparkle Care for a bite? 
    Pinkie Pie I don't mind if I do. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Mmmmm. 
     

     
     

A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1

    Rarity Ahh! 
     
    Rarity It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous! 
     
    Applejack  
     
    Spike Twi... light! ...I... have... Lemme just...  
    Twilight Sparkle Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.  I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music. 
    Fluttershy Oh my goodness! What an honor! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception. 
    Pinkie Pie Hip, hip, hooray! 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception. 
    Applejack Well, color me pleased as punch! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dashâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle ...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their "I do"'s. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids. 
    Rarity Princess Celestia wants me toâ€“  ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married? 
    Spike Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first. 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...  My brother?! 

     

    Applejack Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally?  
    Fluttershy Um, Twilight? Are you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Big Brother Best Friend Forever? 
    Rest of main cast Ohhh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend.

        When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly 
        To see how many other ponies I could meet 
        I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need 
        Other ponies to make my life complete 

        But there was one colt that I cared for 
        I knew he would be there for me 

        My big brother, best friend forever! 
        Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together 

        He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!) 
        We never had a single fight (We did everything together!) 
        We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams 
        I miss him more than I realized 
        It seems... 

    

        Your big brother, best friend forever 
        Like two peas in a pod, you did everything together 

    

        And though he's, oh, so far away 
        I hoped that he would stay 
        My big brother best friend 
        Forever... 
        Forever... 

    Applejack As one of your P.F.F.'s... 
     
    Applejack Pony Friends Forever... 
    Rest of main cast Ohhh! 
    Applejack ...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy. 
    Twilight Sparkle He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard. 
    Rarity  So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard? 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess we are. 
    Rarity Ooh, ooh, oooh! 
     
    Rest of main cast  

    Rainbow Dash A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say "best wedding ever"?! 
    Pinkie Pie  Best wedding ever! 
    Spike So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party? 
    Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Fluttershy  
    Applejack Why the long face, sugarcube? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other. 
    Applejack Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married. 

    Pinkie Pie We're here, we're here! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, what's with all the guards? 
    Rarity I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies. 
    Pinkie Pie Aaaaaaaaaâ€“  
    Rarity Now, let's get going! We've got work to do! 
    Applejack And you've got a big brother to go congratulate. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind. 

    Twilight Sparkle I've got something to say to you, mister. 
    Shining Armor Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? Iâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake! 
    Shining Armor It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it? 
    Shining Armor It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see. 
     
    Shining Armor  The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more? 
    Shining Armor Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now. 
    Twilight Sparkle You want me to be your best mare? 
    Shining Armor Well... yeah. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"? 
    Shining Armor Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter. 
    Twilight Sparkle Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?! 
    Shining Armor  You tell me. She was your foalsitter. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind... 

    Young Twilight Sparkle I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter! 
    Young Cadance I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle  You're a princess. I'm just a regular old unicorn. 
    Young Cadance You are anything but a regular old unicorn. 
    Young Twilight and Young Cadance Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!  

    Wild Fire I am going for a hooficure and that is that! 
    Lucky Clover You are not goingâ€“ 
    Wild Fire I am! I am! 
    Lucky Clover I've already paid for three this month! 
    Wild Fire I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onlâ€“ 
    Lucky Clover Please, we've done this at leastâ€“ 
    Lucky Clover and Wild Fire  
    Lucky Clover Oh! Ho, ho, ho. 
    Wild Fire Oh, sweetie. You just did that face. 

    Twilight Sparkle How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her!  You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance! 
    Princess Cadance I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. 
    Twilight Sparkle Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! 
    Princess Cadance What are you doing? 
    Twilight Sparkle Cadance, it's me, Twilight! 
    Princess Cadance  Uh-huh. 
    Shining Armor I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear? 
    Princess Cadance Absolutely. 
    Shining Armor Well, we'll let you get to it. 

     
    Applejack Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted... 
    Twilight Sparkle Mmm. Check. 
    Spike  
    Applejack Hiya, Princess! 
    Princess Cadance Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. 
    Applejack Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day? 
    Princess Cadance I have! 
     
    Princess Cadance  
    Applejack Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go?  I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Did... you see what she... 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed!  "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza." 
    Princess Cadance Did I hear someone say my name? 
    Rarity Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion.  
    Princess Cadance  Uh-huh. Is my dress ready? 
    Rarity  Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm! 
    Princess Cadance I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train. 
    Rarity Oh, yes, of course. 
    Princess Cadance And those should be a different color. 
    Twinkleshine I think they're lovely. 
    Minuette Me too! 
    Lyra Heartstrings I love them. 
    Princess Cadance Make them a different color. 
    Twilight Sparkle Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants." 

     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, let me see. We've been over the games...  ...the dances... 
     
    Pinkie Pie  I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you? 
    Princess Cadance Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party. 
    Pinkie Pie  Thank you! 

    Princess Luna Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night. 
    Twilight Sparkle Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever. 
    Spike  Who, me? 
    Applejack Spike! That goes on the cake. 
    Spike  
    Rarity Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, she was so demanding! 
    Rarity Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day? 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash? 
    Applejack Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, she was just being fake and totally insincere! 
    Fluttershy She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal. 
    Twilight Sparkle See? Rude! 
    Fluttershy But he was singing really off-key. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treatedâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie and Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him! 
    Applejack Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother? 
    Rest of main cast Uh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even  be a wedding! 

     
    Shining Armor Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle We need to talk. I think you're making a bigâ€“ 
    Princess Cadance  
    Shining Armor Oh, uh, hi, sweetie. 
    Twilight Sparkle She sure has a way of sneaking up on people. 
    Princess Cadance Could I speak to you for a moment, dear? 
    Shining Armor Better see what she wants. 
    Princess Cadance  Look, we need to talk. 
    Shining Armor  I'm here to talk. 
    Princess Cadance  It's about your sister, okay? 
    Shining Armor  Iâ€“ look, look, she's okayâ€“ 
    Princess Cadance  Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No noâ€“ 
    Shining Armor  I'm listening, I'm listening. 
    Princess Cadance  I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that. 
    Shining Armor This was my favorite uncle's. 
    Princess Cadance And? 
    Shining Armor And I think I should wear it. 
    Princess Cadance Are you disagreeing with me? 
    Shining Armor I guess I amâ€“ Ah! 
    Princess Cadance Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches? 
    Shining Armor Gyah! 
    Princess Cadance Feeling better? 
    Shining Armor  Mm-hmm. 
    Twilight Sparkle She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil! 
    Shining Armor Twilight! 
    Princess Cadance Let her go. 
    Shining Armor Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me. 

    Princess Luna Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle. 
    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to helpâ€“ 
    Twilight's friends  
    Twilight Sparkle Dresses? What are youâ€“? 
    Fluttershy Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids! 
    Twilight Sparkle New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids? 
    Applejack She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them. 
    Rarity Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything. 
    Applejack And you had your doubts about her. 
    Rarity Told you she was an absolute gem! 
    Rainbow Dash You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic. 
    Rarity Hmm. I'll see what I can do. 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like I really am on my own. 

     
    Princess Celestia Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter. 
     
    Princess Celestia I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare. 
    Spike  I do! 
    Shining Armor Hey... has anypony seen Twilight? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you! 
    Shining Armor I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this. 
    Princess Cadance Maybe we should just ignore her. 
    Twilight Sparkle You have to listen to me! 
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness! Are you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm fine. 
    Applejack Ya sure about that? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got something to say! She's evil! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Royal guard  
    Twilight Sparkle She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all ! 
    Princess Cadance  Why are you doing this to me?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Because you're evil! 
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life! 
     
    Shining Armor You want to know why my eyes went all ? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Shining Armor And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your  friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding! 
    Twilight Sparkle I was just trying toâ€“ 
    Shining Armor She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you!  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all. 
    Applejack C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle I wasâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia You have a lot to think about. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother. 

        He was my big brother, best friend 
        Forever... 
        And now, we'll never do anything 
        Together... 

     
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry! 
    Princess Cadance You will be. 
     
     

     
     

A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2

     

    Twilight Sparkle "Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."  My brother? 

    Shining Armor Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid. 

    Twilight Sparkle How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! 

    Shining Armor A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. 

    Twilight Sparkle But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know. 

    Shining Armor Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance. 

    Twilight Sparkle Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! 

    Princess Cadance I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. 

    Twilight Sparkle Cadance, it's me! Twilight! 
    Princess Cadance  Uh-huh. 

    Shining Armor And I think I should wear it. 
    Princess Cadance Are you disagreeing with me? 

    Twilight Sparkle She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all ! 

    Shining Armor Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all. 

    Twilight Sparkle I just lost a brother. I'm sorry! 

    Princess Cadance You will be. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle  Hello? Is anyone there? 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Where am I? 
    Princess Cadance The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison. 
    Twilight Sparkle Help! Help! 
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle Plans? What plans? 
    Princess Cadance The plans I have for your brother, of course. 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster! 
    Princess Cadance Only way to stop me is to catch me!  
     
    Princess Cadance No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter. 
    Twilight Sparkle Likely story! 
    Princess Cadance Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves... 
    Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance ...and do a little shake. 
    Twilight Sparkle You remember me! 
    Princess Cadance Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most? 
    Queen Chrysalis  
    Twilight Sparkle We have to get out of here. We have to stop her! 
    Queen Chrysalis  

    

        This day is going to be perfect 
        The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small 
        Everypony will gather 'round 
        Say I look lovely in my gown 
        What they don't know is that I have fooled them all! 

    

        This day was going to be perfect 
        The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small 
        But instead of having cake 
        With all my friends to celebrate 
        My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at allâ€¦ 

    

        I could care less about the dress 
        I won't partake in any cake 
        Vows, well I'll be lying when I say 

        That through any kind of weather 
        I'll want us to be together 
        The truth is I don't care for him at all 

        No I do not love the groom 
        In my heart there is no room 
        But I still want him to be all mine 

    

        We must escape before it's too late 
        Find a way to save the day 
        Hope, I'll be lying if I say 

        "I don't fear that I may lose him 
        To one who wants to use him 
        Not care for, love, and cherish him each day" 

        For I oh so love the groom 
        All my thoughts he does consume 
        Oh, Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon 

    

        Finally the moment has arrived 
        For me to be one lucky bride 

    

        Oh, the wedding we won't make 
        He'll end up marrying a fake 
        Shining Armor will be... 

    Queen Chrysalis ...mine, all mine.  

     
    Princess Celestia Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of  Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor. 
    Princess Cadance Oh, we're never going to save him. 
    Twilight Sparkle We will. We just have to find... There! 
    Minuette, Lyra Heartstrings, and Twinkleshine You're not going anywhere. 

    Princess Celestia Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce youâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Stop! 
     
    Queen Chrysalis Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother?  Why does she have to ruin my special day? 
    Princess Cadance Because it's not your special day! It's mine! 
     
    Queen Chrysalis What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids? 

    Minuette, Lyra Heartstrings, and Twinkleshine I want it! 

    Queen Chrysalis Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late. 
    Applejack I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em? 
    Princess Cadance She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them. 
     
     
    Queen Chrysalis  Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of! 
    Princess Cadance They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us! 
    Queen Chrysalis  Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear? 
    Shining Armor Mm-hmm. 
    Queen Chrysalis Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it. 
    Changelings  
    Queen Chrysalis  He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance  
    Queen Chrysalis And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard. 
    Princess Cadance Not my Shining Armor! 
    Queen Chrysalis Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria! 
    Princess Celestia No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you! 
    Queen Chrysalis  
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia! 
    Queen Chrysalis Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia! 
    Princess Celestia The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen. 
    Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy Rarity! 
    Queen Chrysalis  You can run, but you can't hide! 
    Changelings  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Go, go! 
    Rainbow Dash Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...? 
    Twilight Sparkle They're changelings, remember? 
    Changelings  They're changelings, remember? 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope. 
     
    Changelings  
    Changeling  
    Applejack OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me! 
    Pinkie Pie  Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better. 
     

    Princess Cadance You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends willâ€“ 
     
    Queen Chrysalis You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed! 
     
    Queen Chrysalis  
    Applejack Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not your fault. She fooled everypony. 
    Queen Chrysalis Hmm, I did, didn't I? 

        This day has been just perfect 
        The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small 
        Everypony I'll soon control 
        Every stallion, mare, and foal 
        Who says a girl can't really have it all?  

    Twilight Sparkle Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance! 
     
    Shining Armor Whaâ€“ where... huh? Is...is the wedding over? 
    Queen Chrysalis It's all over! 
    Twilight Sparkle Your spell! Perform your spell! 
    Queen Chrysalis  What good would that do? My changelings already roam free. 
    Shining Armor No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them. 
    Princess Cadance My love will give you strength. 
    Queen Chrysalis  What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment. 
     
    Queen Chrysalis Noooooo! 
    Queen Chrysalis and Changelings  
    Princess Celestia Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together. 

    Princess Cadance  
     
     

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you? 
    Shining Armor I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too. 
    Princess Celestia Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenzaâ€“ 
    Princess Cadance Princess Cadance is fine. 
    Princess Celestia Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt! 
     
    Princess Celestia This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn. 
    Shining Armor and Princess Cadance  
    Princess Celestia Rainbow Dash, that's your cue. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Best... wedding... ever! 

     
    Princess Luna Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything? 
    Pinkie Pie  Let's get this party started! 

    

        Love is in bloom 
        A beautiful bride, a handsome groom, 
        Two hearts becoming one 
        A bond that cannot be undone because 

        Love is in bloom 
        A beautiful bride, a handsome groom 
        I said love is in bloom 
        You're starting a life and making room 
        For us (For us, For us....) 

    Shining Armor Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily. 
    Twilight Sparkle Love you too, B.B.B.F.F. 
    Shining Armor Ready to go? 
    Princess Cadance Oh! Almost forgot. 
    Rarity IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha. 

    

        Love is in bloom 
        A beautiful bride, a handsome groom 
        I said love is in bloom 
        You're starting a life and making room 
        For us, (For us... For us... Aah...) 

    Twilight Sparkle Now this was a great wedding. 
    Spike Oh, yeah? Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party!  
    Everypony  
     

     
     

The Crystal Empire - Part 1

    Royal guard #1 News from Northern Equestria! Uh... Your Highness. 
    Princess Celestia Yes? 
    Royal guard #1 I am simply to tell you that it has returned. 
    Princess Celestia  Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. 
    Royal guard #2 Yes, Your Highness. 
    Princess Celestia My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle  Where are all my quills? Brbrbr. No, no, no, no, no... Ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes 1 through 36! Where is it?! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me. On everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards. 
    Spike Twilight, calm down. It's just a test. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just a test? Just a test!? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam, and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?! 
    Spike Uh... yes. 
    Applejack I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considerin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle Urgh! 
     

    Princess Luna Are you sure you don't want me to go as well? 
    Princess Celestia Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon. 
    Princess Luna The Empire's magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister. 
    Princess Celestia She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ahem. 
    Princess Celestia Trust me, little sister. 
    Twilight Sparkle You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills and plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry, sorry! 
    Princess Celestia This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned. 
    Twilight Sparkle The Crystal Empire? I'm sorry, I-I thought I'd studied. Ooh. I don't think there's anything in any of my books thâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire. 
    King Sombra  
     
    Princess Celestia He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north. 
    King Sombra  
    Princess Celestia But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it. 
    Twilight Sparkle You want me to help protect an entire empire? 
    Princess Celestia It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass. 
    Twilight Sparkle How do I begin? 
    Princess Celestia By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire. 
    Twilight Sparkle My brother is there? 
    Princess Celestia He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies. 
    Twilight Sparkle But what if I fail? 
    Princess Celestia You won't. 
    Twilight Sparkle But what ifâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia You won't. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand? 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm! 
    Princess Celestia Then go. There is no time to lose. 

    Spike Ah! Twilight! That was fast! Let me guess, you got a perfect score? A-minus? B-plus?  fail? 

    

        I was prepared to do my best 
        Thought I could handle any test 
        For I can do so many tricks 
        But I wasn't prepared for this 

        Levitation would have been a breeze 
        Facts and figures I recite with ease 

    Twilight Sparkle The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine. 
    Professor Bill Neigh She is correct! 

    

        I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss 
        But I wasn't prepared for this 
        Will I fail, or will I pass? 
        I can't be sure... 

    

        She can't be sure... 

    

        My mind is sharp, my skills intact 
        My heart is pure... 

    

        Her heart is pure... 

    

        Oh, I've taken my share of licks 
        I've made it through the thin and thick 
        But no I wasn't 

    

        Oh no, she wasn't 

    

        Oh no, I wasn't 

    

        Oh no, she wasn't 

    

        No I wasn't 

    

        Prepared... for this! 

    Spike Uh, prepared for what exactly? 
    Applejack Twilight! Uh, did you pass? 
    Pinkie Pie Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia? 
    Twilight Sparkle Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire! 
    All Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash Crystal what? 

     
     
    Rarity Ha! And you all made fun of me for packing so many scarves. 
    Spike  
    Shining Armor Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor? 
    Shining Armor Twily! You made it! We'd better get moving. There are things out here we really don't want to run into after dark. 
    Fluttershy  What kind of things? 
    Shining Armor Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned. 

    Shining Armor Something keeps trying to get in! We think it's the unicorn king who originally cursed the place. 
    Twilight Sparkle But Princess Celestia said I was being sent here to find a way to protect the Empire! If King Sombra can't get in, then it must already be protected. 
     
    Fluttershy  Th-That's one of the things, isn't it? 
    Shining Armor Guh. We have to get to the Crystal Empire! Now! 
    King Sombra  
    Twilight Sparkle Go, go! 
    Shining Armor Almost there. 
    King Sombra  
    Twilight Sparkle  Everypony okay? 
    Other ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, no! Shining Armor, your horn! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Sparkleriffic! 

    Rarity It's gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous!  There are no words! 
    Applejack Focus, Rarity. We're here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery. 
    Rainbow Dash Eh, I don't see what the big deal is. Just looks like another old castle to me. 
    Rarity Aâ€“ pâ€“ guh! Another old...! Have you lost your mind? Look at the magniâ€“ 
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Very funny. 

    Twilight Sparkle Cadance! 
    Princess Cadance Ooh. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!  
    Princess Cadance One of these days we need to get together when the fate of Equestria isn't hanging in the balance.  
    Twilight Sparkle Are you okay? 
    Shining Armor Cadance has been able to use her magic to spread love and light. That seems to be what is protecting it. But she hasn't slept, barely eats. I want to help her, but my protection spell has been countered by King Sombra. 
    Princess Cadance  It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine. 
    Shining Armor She's not fine. She can't go on like this forever, and if her magic were to fade... Well, you saw what's out there waiting for that to happen. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's why we're here. 
    Applejack Why we're all here. 
    Other ponies Mm-hmm. 
    Shining Armor Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies. 
    Rarity Crystal Ponies?! Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?! Um, ahem. Please continue. 
    Shining Armor But we have to believe one of them knows how we can protect the Empire without having to use Cadance's magic. 
    Twilight Sparkle A research paper! 
    Shining Armor Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle That must be part of my test â€“ to gather information from the Crystal Ponies and deliver it to you! This is gonna be great! I love research papers! 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, who doesn't? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh-oh-oh! Lemme guess! Is it Spike? Nono, Fluttershy! Rarity? 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, big brother. I am really good at this sort of thing. 

    Twilight Sparkle Are you sure? Absolutely sure? 
    Sapphire Joy I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. But I... can't seem to remember anything before King Sombra came to power.  
    Twilight Sparkle King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally. 
    Sapphire Joy Have we really been gone a thousand years? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. 
    Sapphire Joy It feels like it was just yesterday. 
    Twilight Sparkle If you think of anything, even the smallest thing... 
    Sapphire Joy Of course. 
    Spike Well, that was a total bust. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe the others are having better luck. 

    Rainbow Dash A way to protect the Empire! You know anything about it or what? 
    "Fleur de Verre" I wish I could help you. Really. 
    Rainbow Dash Hold on! You gotta know something! 
    "Fleur de Verre" But... I don't have any information. 

    Fluttershy Oh, um. Excuse me! Oh! Hello! Umm, I was just wondering.  
    Pinkie Pie Time to gather some intel! 
    Elbow Grease It just feels like something is missing. 
    "Night Knight" I know. It looks the same, but it doesn't feel the same. 
    Pinkie Pie Because it isn't! 
    Elbow Grease  A spy! 
    Pinkie Pie  A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y! 
     

    Rarity Hm-hm-hmmm. And when you flip your mane, it simply must create a rainbow of color. Oh! Wouldn't I look just magnificent? So sparkly!  

    Rainbow Dash  I got nothing so far. 
    Rarity Oh, me neither. 
    Pinkie Pie  My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ooookay. 
    Applejack Sorry, Twilight. These crystal ponies seem to have some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'. Only thing I was able to get out of 'em was somethin' about a library. 
    Twilight Sparkle  A library? Well, why didn't you say so?! 
    Applejack Uh... thought I just did. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle I just... I don't even know what to... There are no words. 
    Amethyst Maresbury Ahem. May I help you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. We're looking for a book. 
    Amethyst Maresbury We have plenty of those. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You do. You really do. 
    Applejack We're lookin' for a history book. Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day. 
    Amethyst Maresbury Yes. Of course. History, history... Ah, yes. 
    Mane Six  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Which is where, exactly? 
    Amethyst Maresbury I... I can't seem to remember. I'm not sure I actually work here. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll just take a look around. I'm sure we can find it on our own. 
    Amethyst Maresbury Let me know if you find anything. 
    Pinkie Pie I like her! 

    Applejack Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no, no, no, no... Yes! "History of the Crystal Empire". I just hope it has the answers we need. 

    Twilight Sparkle A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to "renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm". My friends and I could put it together. Everything we need to know is in the book! 
    Shining Armor That sounds pretty promising. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll get started right away. C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together! 
    Spike  

    

        Princess Cadance needs our help 
        Her magic will not last forever 
        I think we can do it 
        But we need to work together 

        We have to get this right 
        Yes, we have to make them see 
        We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history 

    

        It says that they liked jousting 

    

        They flew a flag of many hues 

    

        Made sweets of crystal berries 

    

        They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes 

    

        Oh, we have to get this right 
        Yes, we have to make them see 
        We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history 

    

        There was a crystal flugelhorn 
        That every pony liked to play 

    

        And the Crystal Kingdom anthem 
        Can you learn it in a day? 

    

        Oh, we have to get this right 
        Yes, we have to make them see 
        We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history 

    Twilight Sparkle It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you! One last check to make sure everything is in place, and then the festivities can begin! 
    Applejack What's this thing for? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block. 
    Applejack Nice work, Twi. Think we're ready to get this faire up and runnin'. 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Hear ye, hearâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie  My bad. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ahem. Hear ye, hear ye! Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor do cordially invite you to attend the Crystal Faire! 
    Crystal Ponies  
    Applejack Come on in, y'all. Got food and drinks thataway, games and crafts are thataway, Crystal Heart to the back near the Princess. 
    Elbow Grease Did she say... Crystal Heart? 
    Crystal Ponies  
    Rainbow Dash We totally nailed it, right? Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now! Gonna have some grub, huh? What are you thinking? Crystal Empire berry pie? Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!  What is with these ponies?! 
    Sapphire Joy Seeing all of this, I feel like I'm starting to remember. Remember things from before the king. 
    "Fleur de Verre" Me too. 
    Sapphire Joy and "Fleur de Verre"  The Crystal Heart! 
    "Fleur de Verre" Do you think they really have it? 
    Rainbow Dash Of course we have it! Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right? 
    Amethyst Maresbury Of course you can't. The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the Empire can be protected!  I do work at the library! 
    Rainbow Dash W-what's that about 'powering the heart'? 
    Amethyst Maresbury I just can't believe you found it. King Sombra said he'd hidden it away where we would never see it again! I only hope it will still be as powerful after all these years...! Mm, funnel cake! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Why did youâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash I think we may have a problem... 

    Twilight Sparkle I didn't know it was an actual relic! The book didn't mention anything about the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart! There was a page missing... How did I not notice?! 
    Princess Cadance It's alright, Twilight. 
    Shining Armor Twily... 
     
    King Sombra  
     

     
     

The Crystal Empire - Part 2

     

    Twilight Sparkle You wanted to see me? To give me a test? 
    Princess Celestia The Crystal Empire has returned. 

    Twilight Sparkle You want me to help protect an entire empire? 

    Princess Celestia It must be you and you alone. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle But what if I fail? 

    Shining Armor Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned. 

    Twilight Sparkle Go, go! 

    Pinkie Pie Sparkleriffic! 

    Shining Armor Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies. 
    Rarity There are Crystal Ponies?! 

    Sapphire Joy I wish I could help you. But I... can't seem to remember anything before King Sombra came to power.  

    Twilight Sparkle "History of the Crystal Empire". The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the Faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block. 

    Amethyst Maresbury The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the empire can be protected! 

    Rainbow Dash I think we may have a problem... 

    Twilight Sparkle I didn't know it was an actual relic! 
    Princess Cadance It's alright, Twilight. 
    Shining Armor Twily... 
     
    King Sombra  

     

    King Sombra  
    Shining Armor The Empire is under attack. 
     
    King Sombra Arrgh! 
     
    Shining Armor I have to find the Crystal Heart! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, you stay here with Cadance. She needs you, Shining Armor. I'll retrieve the Heart. 
    Rainbow Dash Let's do this! 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been trying to figure out how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test. Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it. But there is something else you can do. 
    Rainbow Dash Name it. 
    Twilight Sparkle You and the rest of our friends have to keep the Faire going. 
    Rainbow Dash What? With that thing moving into the Empire? 
    Twilight Sparkle The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so they can activate the Crystal Heart. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, and? 
    Twilight Sparkle If the Crystal Ponies find out that King Sombra is trying to take over the Empire again, their spirits are gonna be anything but lifted. It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart. They won't be able to make it work. You have to keep them happy here at the Faire. 
    Rainbow Dash Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high. Done and done! 
    Shining Armor Twily, be careful. 
    Twilight Sparkle I will. 
     

     
    Sapphire Joy  
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Huuuuh?  
    Spike  Uh-huh. We can do that. Twilight's doing what?! 
    Rarity He... really... loves getting his face painted. Haha. 

    Rainbow Dash Who wants a flugelhorn? 
    Pinkie Pie I want a flugelhorn! 
    Rainbow Dash Who else wants a flugelhorn? 
    Pinkie Pie  I want a flugelhorn!! 
    Spike  Twilight, wait! I'm coming with you! 
    Twilight Sparkle You can't. I have to retrieve the Crystal Heart by myself. 
    Spike I know. I promise I won't lift a claw to help you. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Not a claw, Spike. 
    Spike Where are we going exactly? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think I might know where King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart. 
    Spike The castle? 
    Twilight Sparkle The king would've been counting on the fact that nopony would dare come looking for it here. They'd have been too afraid to even try. 
    Spike I hope you're right. 
    Twilight Sparkle You and me both. 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash What are you lookin' at?! That's what I thought! 
    Applejack  Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong. 
    Rainbow Dash Exactly.  
    Applejack  What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh. Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Knight Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash It's showtime. 

    Applejack How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time? 
    Sapphire Joy The best I've had in over a thousand years! 
    Applejack Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right? 
    Sapphire Joy I sure would like to see it before the ceremony. It's been such a long time. 
    Applejack Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar!  Come on, Twilight... These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat! 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle It's gotta be here somewhere. It's just gotta be! Not a claw, Spike. 
    Spike Uh...  
    Twilight Sparkle Celestia's orders! 
    Princess Celestia  
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! 
    Spike  Argh! What? Did you find it? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Because this isn't King Sombra's castle. 
    Spike Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power? 
    Twilight Sparkle It is. But it didn't look like this.  
    Spike Whoa. When did you learn to do that? 
    Twilight Sparkle That was a little trick Celestia taught me. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle You stay here. 
    Spike Huh, if you insist.  Can you see what's down there yet? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Not yet. I can't even tell how far down this goes! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike? 
    Spike  Yeah? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Can you see outside? 
     
    King Sombra  Yesss... Crystalsss... 
    Spike It's not good! Cadance's magic must be fading  faster than before! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh! Ow!  
    Spike  Twilight? Are you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What in the...  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, I think it's here! Huh? 
    Princess Celestia What are you doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! I opened the door andâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia And now you must go. 
    Twilight Sparkle Go where? 
    Princess Celestia Doesn't matter to me. You failed the test, Twilight! 

    Twilight Sparkle I don't understand! The test? 
    Princess Celestia Not only will you not move on to the next level of your studies, you won't continue your studies at all! 
    Twilight Sparkle I... You didn't say anything about no longer being your student if I failed! 
    Princess Celestia Didn't I? 
    Twilight Sparkle But... what do I do now? 
    King Sombra  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  I know you told me to stay up there, but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and I got worried so I came down here and you were just staring at that wall and... I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, andâ€“ What were you looking at? I mean... it's just a wall. ...Ponyville?! Well, how did I get... No! I don't wanna go! Please, Twilight, don't make me! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle King Sombra's dark magic. A doorway that leads to your worst fear. 
    Spike We were home. You told me you didn't need me anymore. You were sending me away... 
    Twilight Sparkle A fear that will never come to pass. I'm never gonna send you away. And I'm not gonna fail my test! 
     
    Spike What's in there? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Maybe you should come with me this time. 

     
    King Sombra  
    Crystal Ponies  
    Fluttershy  
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy  
    Crystal Ponies cheering] 
    Crystal Pony  Bravo, Knight Rainbow Dash! 
    Fluttershy  Isn't there... somepony else who could... take over the jousting demonstration with you? 
    Rainbow Dash  The fate of an entire empire rests on us showing these ponies a good time. But, y'know, if that isn't important to you... 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  Okay, okay, I'll take it easy on you next time. But not too easy. I've got a reputation to maintain! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  What if this is just more of his magic? He makes a door that leads to your worst nightmare. Why not a staircase that goes on forever? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hold on to me. 
    Spike Uh... 
    Twilight Sparkle  Whoa. Whoaaa! Yaaaah! 

    Elbow Grease  
    "Fleur de Verre"  
    Crystal Ponies  
    Rarity  I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth! I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw! I made it work. But still! 
    Applejack We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'. The Princess isn't lookin' so good. I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer. It's gonna be fine. These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway. 
    Pinkie Pie I sure hope that time comes soon! Even I can't keep this party going forever!  
     
    "Crystal Arrow" This isn't the Crystal Heart. 
    Rarity  Oh, of course it isn't. The real one isâ€“ 
    Applejack On its way! 
    Rarity  I was going to say 'being polished' to buy us some more time? 
    Applejack Oops. 
    King Sombra  
    Crystal Ponies  
    "Amber Waves" It's... It's him! 
    King Sombra Crystal Heart... 

    Twilight Sparkle Whoooooahahaha! I actually studied gravity spells, thinking it might be on my test! Turns out I was prepared for this! Wooo-hooo!  
     
     
    King Sombra  

     
    Twilight Sparkle The Heart... Where's the Crystalâ€“ 
    Spike Here! It rolled over to me when you dropped it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't move! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle You can move, just not toward me! How could I have been so foolish? I was just so eager to get it! Then when I saw what was going on outside, I... 
    Spike You have to get out of there, Twilight! You have to be the one who brings the Heart to Princess Cadance! If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test! 
    Twilight Sparkle King Sombra is already attacking the Empire. He could reach the Crystal Ponies at any moment... reach Princess Cadance, my brother, my friends. There may not be enough time for me to find a way to escape. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle You have to be the one to bring the Crystal Heart to the Faire. 
    Spike Me? But Twilightâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Go! 
    Spike Butâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Goooo! 
     
    Crystal Ponies  
    Applejack Now, don't y'all worry your pretty, little Crystal heads! The real Crystal Heart will be here any second! 
    Rarity  I don't know if they believe you... 
    Applejack  Don't know if I believe me... 
     
    "Amber Waves" He's back! I can't take it!  Ugh! 
    King Sombra Ahhhhhh... 
    "Amber Waves"  King Sombra...! 
    King Sombra My crystal slaves... 
    Spike Whoa! Huh!  Hey! Up here! 
    Rarity Spike? 
    Spike I got the Crystal Heart! 
    King Sombra  That is mine! 
     
    King Sombra  
    Rarity  Spikey-wikey! 
    Princess Cadance  
    King Sombra Hah. Huh? 
    Crystal Ponies  
    Bright Smile Behold! The Crystal Princess! 
     
    Princess Cadance The Crystal Heart has returned. Use the light and love within you to ensure that King Sombra does not. 
     
    King Sombra What? No... No! Stop! 
     
     
    Rarity Oooh!  
     
    King Sombra  
     
     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  Good job, Spike. 

    Rarity I do so wish it was permanent. Did you see how my mane just absolutely sparkled? 
    Applejack But... good things are better when they're a rarity. 
    Rarity Aww.  
    Shining Armor Everything's gonna be okay. You've gotta stop saving my rump like this. It's starting to get embarrassing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wasn't me who saved you in the end. It was Spike. 
    Shining Armor It's just a test. Maybe she'll let you retake it. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think she's gonna give me a new test. 

    Spike  Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight... 

    Princess Celestia It's beautiful. 
    Twilight Sparkle I wish it had been me who ultimately made it so. But it wasn't. 
    Princess Celestia Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests. 
    Twilight Sparkle Does this mean...? 

    Spike She's totally gonna lose it!  Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I passed! 
    Other main characters  
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh. 

    

        You were prepared to do your best 
        Had what it takes to pass the test 
        All those doubts you can dismiss 
        Turns out you were 

    

        Prepared for this! 

    

        You clearly have just what it takes 

    

        To pass a test with such high stakes 

    

        We knew for sure you would prevail 

    

        Since when does Twilight Sparkle ever fail? 

    

        All those doubts that you can dismiss 
        Trust yourself and you cannot miss 

    

        Turns out you were 

    

        Turns out I was 

    

        Turns out you were 

    

        Turns out I was 

    

        Turns out you were 

    

        Prepared for this! 

    Spike  

     
     

Too Many Pinkie Pies

     
    Spike Try again, Twi, you can do it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Phew, this spell's a toughie. But I feel lucky this time! One, two... 
    Pinkie Pie Hi! 
    Twilight Sparkle Nnnnnng! Pinkie, why'd you do that?! 
    Pinkie Pie 'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend. Whatcha doin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Trying to turn that apple into an orange! 
    Spike But you kinda threw her aim off... 
    Pinkie Pie Wheee!  What a cute orange birdie! Do me next, Twilight! Do me, do me! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange? It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun! 
    Rarity As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making? Delightful, non? 
    Pinkie Pie  This is terrible! 
    Rarity I admit it's perhaps not my finest work, but Iâ€“ 
     
    Pinkie Pie You had total-awesome-amazing fun and missed out on it?! Neh! Wait! What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?! 
    Spike We weren't going to turn her into an orange! I swear! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing? 
    Rainbow Dash This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog. Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up. 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, fun! Wheeeeee! Gotta go! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, thanks, Pinkie...? 

    Pinkie Pie Hey, Applejack! That looks like fun, can I join you? Wheee! Next time I'll pull you! 

    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy!  fun? 
    Fluttershy Not especially. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, good. Fun... is hard...!  

     

    Fluttershy Feeling better, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie Abso-tutely-lutely! Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back! 
    Fluttershy What are friends for? 
    Pinkie Pie That's just the thing! I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all! It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual! 
    Fluttershy I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help. 
    Pinkie Pie You are such a good friend. 
    Applejack There you are, Pinkie. Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Pinkie. Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about. 
    Applejack Heh. Well, I'll be an apple crisp. I'm here for the same reason. 
    Pinkie Pie This is perfect! Everyone will now bring their fun to me. Ha, this'll solve everything! Why didn't I think of that? 
    Rainbow Dash Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays. Wanna hang? 
    Pinkie Pie I am so there. Wheee. 
    Applejack And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Pinkie Pie And I'm also so there. Whee, whee. 
    Rainbow Dash But... that's when I'll be at the swimming hole. Ah, well, doesn't matter. Whichever one you choose is okay with me. 
    Applejack Me too. 
    Pinkie Pie  Choose? 

    Twilight Sparkle One, two... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you doing now? 
    Pinkie Pie Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres. I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip!  If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, Pinkie. I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, the only way to pull something like that off is if there's more of you to go around. 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie That's it, Twilight! The legend of the Mirror Pool! 
    Twilight Sparkle Legend of the who-what now? Pinkie! I'm familiar with loads of legends, and I never heard ofâ€“ 
    Spike Does this mean practice is over? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course not! Back to work. 

    Pinkie Pie Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages. I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story. "Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!"  What was that?! Oh, I heard a voice! Oh. Hehe. It was me. Ouch! Ooh! Stop scratching me up, you brambles, andâ€“ Whoooaaa! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, and there's that voice again! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself. Starting... now. "And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!" 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Wheee-heee! 
    Pinkie Pie Wow, the legend is true. It really worked! 
    Pinkie Pie 2  
    Pinkie Pie Okay, wait. I promised not talk to myself anymore. I should say something to her. Or... would that still be talking to myself? Excuse me, me? Can I have a word with you? Uh, I mean, me? Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun, butâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Fun?! Did somebody say fun? Where? 
    Pinkie Pie I did, over here! 
    Pinkie Pie 2 I thought someone said something about fun! Where is it? Over here? Over here? I don't see it! Where is it? Where is it? 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls! Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em. 

    Pinkie Pie ...And then there's Rarity. She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff! I'm thinking she can make us all matching t-shirts that say 'Team Pinkie', andâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Is this Ponyville? Where's the fun? Where's the fun? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, well, let's see, Applejack's having a barn raising atâ€“ 
     
    Pinkie Pie It's that-away! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wait, come back! Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself! Because I'm you and, and you're me, andâ€“ Oh, my gosh! This is the greatest plan ever!  Now, off to double my fun! 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie Let's rock this pool, ponies!  Whee! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Coming in, Dashie? The water's great, it's totally wet and everything! 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know... Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today.  I'm kind of exhausted. 
    Pinkie Pie That's fine, you relax. At least we'll still be together! 
    Rainbow Dash Glad you made it, Pinkie. I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead. 
    Pinkie Pie I did. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh. The barn up yet? 
    Pinkie Pie I have no idea. 
    Rainbow Dash But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's. 
    Pinkie Pie Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now! Whee! 
     

    Fluttershy Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by. I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself. All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them. Come join us. We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters? 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie 2  Wait, but that sounds super fun! Oh, but Applejohn sounds super fun too! Uh, and, and I can't do one without missing out on the other! 
    Fluttershy Who's Applejohn? 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Two fun things at once? But which, which? Oh, can't decide...  Trouble breathing... Walls closing in! 
    Fluttershy Walls? But we're outside. 
    Pinkie Pie 2  
    Fluttershy Goodness. Was it something I said? 
     
    Pinkie Pie 2 Yes! 
    Fluttershy Huh? 

    Pinkie Pie So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once. 
    Rainbow Dash Duplicates of you, huh? Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie.  Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh... 
    Pinkie Pie Gotcha. I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly.  Wheeeee... 
    Rainbow Dash How'd you do that? 
    Pinkie Pie Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend. Ooh, ooh, gotta run. Looks like I'm trying to get my attention. Excuse me. 
    Pinkie Pie 2 And me. 

    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it! Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast? 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Iâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range? 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Iâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, did you get ice cream? What kinds did they have? Banana brickle? 
    Pinkie Pie 2 I didn't make it! I was on my way there and then Fluttershutterâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy. 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Yeah, her. She offered something else fun for me to do! A picnic, with cute little animals! 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, how could you say no to that? 
    Pinkie Pie 2 That's what I'm saying! Then I would've missed the super fun thing with Applesauce! 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack. 
    Pinkie Pie 2  So I didn't do anything fun at all! 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, my poor poor me! There, there. Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies. Easy peasy. 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Really? 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, would I lie to me? 

    Pinkie Pie and Pinkie Pie 2 "...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!" 
    Pinkie Pie 2 Look, a double me! 
    Pinkie Pie I think you mean a double-double me. Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will. 
    Pinkie Pie 2  
    Pinkie Pie 3 Did somebody say fun? Where? Fun fun fun fun fun! 
    Pinkie Pies 2, 3 and 4 Fun!  
    Pinkie Pie Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else. Perfect! Okay, let's go!  Hey, Pinkies! Yoo-hoo! 
    Pinkie Pies 2, 3 and 4 "...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!" 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, good enough. Pinkie Pies, move it outâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates "...not to be scared, at the prospect of being doubly mared!" 
    Pinkie Pie What in the name of pink?! Knock it off! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates Fun!  
    Pinkie Pie To Ponyville, everyone! Follow me! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Yes, it's fun there. 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates Fun!  

    Pinkie Pie Duplicates  
    Pinkie Pie  Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times. An unprecedented and massive undertaking! But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates  Applejack! Fluttershy! Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Excellent. Okay, let's get on with this, folks. Fan out on three. Oneâ€“ 
     
    Pinkie Pie Eh, good enough. La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee! 

    Pinkie Pie Duplicate  
    Rainbow Dash  What theâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates  
    Rainbow Dash Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates! Except now there's triplicates... and quadruplicates! 
    Pinkie Pie Dash is gonna love this! Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Uh-oh... 
    Rainbow Dash No more Pinkies! I can't take it! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Gosh, uh... I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now! Maybe I'd better go check! 

    Applejack, Big McIntosh, Apple Fritter, and Meadow Song  
     
    Applejack No! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, phew! Looks like I haven't missed a thing! 
    Applejack I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so  maybe we should talk a little later? 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! 
    Applejack Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends... 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, everypony, please, calm down! 
    Rarity Calm down? I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop! 
    Fluttershy And they trashed our critter picnic! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out! Come on, Spike. I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Aha, here it is! "The legend of the Mirror Pond"... It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from! 
    Spike That's perfect! Let's go! 
    Twilight Sparkle But there's a catch. If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake! 
    Spike Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then. Shouldn't be too hard. 
    Twilight Sparkle Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them? 
    Ponies  
    Pinkie Pie Twilight! I have to talk to you, I need your help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate No, you're not! I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2 I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3 No, I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 4 I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 5 No, I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 6 I'm the real Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! 
    Applejack How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie? 
    Twilight Sparkle I have no idea. 
    Pinkie Pie Me either. Ohh... We've all got the same adorable tails, we've all got the same adorable manes, we've all got the same adorable hooves! Which one of us is the real Pinkie?! Oh! I haven't the slightest clue! And if I can't tell us apart... who can?  
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! 

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, this is hopeless! 
    Spike Maybe that one's the real Pinkie. 
    Twilight Sparkle Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life! 
    Spike I'm gonna go ask. 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie! They all do! You're wasting your time. 
    Spike So lemme guess. You're the real Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie Heck if I know. Could be any one of us if you ask me. And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway. So just leave me alone. I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this? I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond! 
    Spike I miss the real Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie  I bet she misses you too. Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again. Hey. Hey! What if you gave them a test? Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all! Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond. But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie! 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, that's not a bad idea. 
    Pinkie Pie This is great! If I pass, I get to be with my friends again!  

    Rainbow Dash Hey, Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been looking all over for you ponies. What are you all doing here? 
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down. 
    Twilight Sparkle You guys, we're gonna fix this. And I know exactly how. 
    Fluttershy Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think so. Now come along. I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies. 

     
     
    Applejack Hyah, ya Pinkies! Hyah! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Ooh, they wanna play chase! This is fun, too! 
     
    Applejack Oh, give it a rest. 
    Twilight Sparkle Welcome, Pinkies, welcome. Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable.  Sit down! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Better. Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today. 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate For fun? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, just the opposite actually. 
    Rainbow Dash Wait up, I got one more! Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces. 
    Twilight Sparkle Have her come sit with the others. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test. 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicates  Awww! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Curtain, please. The test... will be watching paint dry! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle On your mark, get set, go! 
    Spike Ooh, this is so exciting! 

    Spike Okay, maybe not that exciting. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Oh, hey, look at the birdie! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Watch me bounce and touch the ceiling! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Is that... is that a frog crossed with an orange? 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 2 Cool! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate 3 Where? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Look what I can do with my hooves!  
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate Betcha can't make a face crazier than... this! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, I can't take it anymore! Somepony's making balloon animals! 
    Pinkie Pie Duplicate What? Where? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, you can look away now. 
    Pinkie Pie I passed? 
    Twilight Sparkle You passed. You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall. 
    Pinkie Pie I had to. I just had to. I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't. But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them. 
    Twilight Sparkle I knew you'd be up to the challenge. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm me! I'm me! I'm me! Or am I? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am. 

    Pinkie Pie Dear Princess Celestia, 
    It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long. 
    Respectfully yours, 
    Pinkie Pie. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, Pinkie Pie. We were thinking we should go out and celebrate. 
    Applejack You up for some wheelbarrow races? 
    Rainbow Dash Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride! 
    Rarity I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh! 
    Pinkie Pie You wanna know exactly what I feel like doing right now?  
    Fluttershy That looks like fun. 
     
    Applejack Oh, Pinkie. 
     

     
     

One Bad Apple

    Apple Bloom  What to wear, what to wear? Oh, what to wear?! 
    Applejack Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. it's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station! 
    Apple Bloom Too casual. Too summery. 
    Applejack  Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'! 
    Apple Bloom This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from Manehattan. I wanna make a good impression! 
    Applejack You know what would make a good impression? 
    Apple Bloom What? 
    Applejack Bein' on time to pick her up! 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common. 
    Apple Bloom  Oh, yeah? What's that? 
    Applejack Neither of you have your cutie mark. 
    Apple Bloom What?! How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that? 
    Applejack Well, Iâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom Oh, this changes everything! Meet you at the train station! I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo! 
    Applejack You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here! 

     

    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Scootaloo Do you really think she'll wanna join? 
    Apple Bloom She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Sweetie Belle I'm just so excited I could burst! 
     
    Apple Bloom Is that the train from Manehattan? 
    Applejack Yep. 
    Apple Bloom That's her! Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her. Oh! No, tha-tha-that's her! Um, no. Oh, wait, thaâ€“ that's not her either, uh... 
    Applejack Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember? 
    Apple Bloom Oh...  Yeah. 
     
    Applejack Ah, that's her! 
    Apple Bloom Babs! Babs! It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom! And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so, so glad you're here! 
    Babs Seed Thanks, I'm happy toâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle This is gonna be the best week of your life! 
    Babs Seed Sure hope it's gonna beâ€“ 
    Scootaloo Seriously, we are gonna have a blast. 
    Applejack  
    Sweetie Belle The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float! 
    Babs Seed Really? I've never been on a float before. 
    Apple Bloom And we've got a really big surprise for you! 
    Babs Seed Yeah... uh... a surprise? 

    Apple Bloom I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse! 
    Babs Seed The Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
    Scootaloo A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members. 
    Sweetie Belle Technically, we're its only members. 
    Apple Bloom But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate! 
    Babs Seed I do? 
    Scootaloo Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all. 
    Babs Seed Oh, yeah...  That... 
    Apple Bloom Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us. 
     
     
    Apple Bloom This is where we do our role call... 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom This is where we eat our lunch... 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas. 
     
    Babs Seed Yeah, uh... 
     
    Apple Bloom Uh, could you excuse us for a moment? 
    Babs Seed Sure... 
    Apple Bloom  Thought she'd be more impressed. 
    Sweetie Belle  She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Hmmmm. 
    Scootaloo  The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float! 
    Apple Bloom  That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Mm-hmm. 

    Apple Bloom Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade! 
    Scootaloo As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun. 
    Babs Seed  
    Diamond Tiara More like funny... 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon ...looking!  
    Silver Spoon What is that thing, a giant orange? 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Apple Bloom It's a pumpkin. 
    Diamond Tiara More like a lame-kin. 
    Silver Spoon  
    Diamond Tiara Who's the new blank flank? 
    Apple Bloom She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan! 
    Diamond Tiara Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you. 
    Silver Spoon Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The  Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
    Babs Seed  
    Apple Bloom Hey!! 
    Diamond Tiara Oooo, heh, big city attitude! I like it! 
    Silver Spoon Mm-hmm! 
    Babs Seed Oh, yeah? Well there's more where that came from! Check this out!  
    Scootaloo Oh no, she didn't! 
    Diamond Tiara, Silver Spoon, and Babs Seed  
     
    Babs Seed Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Apple Bloom When ah tell Applejackâ€“ 
    Babs Seed You gonna tell Applejack what? 
    Apple Bloom W-well, y'know, uh... 
    Babs Seed What're you, a snitch? 
    Diamond Tiara Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies! 
    Apple Bloom What... just happened? 
    Scootaloo I think Babs just went to the dark side. 
    Sweetie Belle We have to tell Applejack! 
    Apple Bloom No! We're not snitches! 
    Scootaloo Yeah! And we're not babies! 
    Sweetie Belle Then... why do I feel like crying? 

    Scootaloo I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float. 
    Apple Bloom I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully! 
    Sweetie Belle  What are we gonna do? 
    Apple Bloom We're gonna build a new float, that's what. 
    Scootaloo Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle We could always tell Applejack. 
    Babs Seed  What are you, a snitch? 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo No! 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales! Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home. 
    Scootaloo Avoid her. Yeah, how hard can that be? 

    

        Yeah, yeah, yeah  
        Yeah, yeah, yeah 
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

    

        First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet 
        A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat 

    

        But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east 
        She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast 

    

        Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead 

    

        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? 
        Got a bully on our tail 
        Gotta hide, we gotta bail 
        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you 
        Gotta run, we gotta flee 
        Gotta hurry, don't you see? 
        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed 

        Yeah, yeah, yeah 
        Yeah, yeah, yeah 
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

    

        Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right 
        But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight 

    

        Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again 
        But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then 

    

        Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead 

    

        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? 
        Got a bully on our tail 
        Gotta hide, we gotta bail 
        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you 
        Gotta run, we gotta flee 
        Gotta hurry, don't you see? 

        Why so mean? Why so crude? 
        Why so angry? Why so rude? 
        Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends? 
        Isn't it sad? Is this how it all ends? 

        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- 
        Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- 
        Babs Seed, Babs Seed- 

    

        She's just a bad, bad seed! 

    Apple Bloom Babs may have run us out of town, but at least we still have the clubâ€“ 
    Babs Seed Hey! What're you doing at my clubhouse? 
    Scootaloo Y- y- your clubhouse?! This is our clubhouse! 
    Babs Seed Well, it was yours, and now it's mine. 
    Silver Spoon And mine. 
    Diamond Tiara And mine. 
    Apple Bloom That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you! 
    Babs Seed And let's keep it that way. Now scram, crybabies! 
    Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump! 
    Diamond Tiara, Silver Spoon, and Babs Seed  
    Sweetie Belle  

    Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom That Babs has really gone too far this time! 
    Scootaloo Kicked out of our own clubhouse! 
    Apple Bloom And my own bed! 
    Scootaloo Seriously? 
    Apple Bloom Super-seriously. 
    Sweetie Belle We need to talk to Applejack. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo No! 
    Sweetie Belle Rarity? 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo No! 
    Sweetie Belle Twilight? 
    Apple Bloom No, no, no! We need to fight back! 
    Scootaloo Yeah! Fight back! How're we gonna do that? 
     
    Apple Bloom  By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade! 
    Scootaloo  Yeah! Wait, what? 
    Apple Bloom  Her face will be there! 

    Babs Seed  
    Sweetie Belle Moo! Moo! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Moo! Moo! 
     
    Babs Seed Aheh...  
    Apple Bloom Are those from the Carousel Boutique? 
    Sweetie Belle Yup. 
    Apple Bloom Excellent. 
    Scootaloo  
    Sweetie Belle Ooh! 
    Scootaloo Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes. 
    Sweetie Belle That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots! 
    Scootaloo The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the thing from the place? 
    Sweetie Belle What's that? 
    Apple Bloom Granny Smith's kitchen timer. 
    Sweetie Belle What's that for? 
    Scootaloo  
    Apple Bloom C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it! 

     
     
     
    Sweetie Belle  Is this it? 
    Scootaloo  I think... we're a go. 
    Sweetie Belle  Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho! 

     
    "Roma" Hot carrot crÃªpes! Get 'em here, get 'em hot! 
     
    Spike  
     
    Babs Seed  Whoaaaa... 
    Sweetie Belle Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean... Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meantâ€“ 
    Scootaloo Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs. 
    Sweetie Belle Ow! 
     
    Scootaloo You had your chance. 
     
    Babs Seed See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies! 
     
    Apple Bloom  The timer set? 
    Sweetie Belle Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Applejack Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Applejack Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan. 
     
    Apple Bloom Heartache? 
    Applejack Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank. 
    Apple Bloom T-t-t-teased? 
    Sweetie Belle B-Bullies?! 
    Applejack Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed. 
     
    Scootaloo So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time. 
    Apple Bloom She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead! 
    Sweetie Belle And now we've turned into bullies too! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders What do we do?! 

     
    Diamond Tiara Nice float, Babs. 
    Babs Seed Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks. 
    Diamond Tiara Too cool for mule, Babs. 
    Mule  
    Apple Bloom We gotta stop that float! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom  Applejack, quick you have toâ€“ 
    Applejack Huh? 
    Apple Bloom  Quick, you have to help usâ€“ 
    Applejack What? 
     
    Apple Bloom We booby-trapped it! 
     
     
    Scootaloo Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float! 
     
    Spectator Oof, my popcorn! 
    Apple Bloom Sorry! 
    Scootaloo 'Scuse me! Ah, whoops. 
    Apple Bloom Whoa! 
    Scootaloo Pinkie Pie, let us in! ("lettuce in") 
    Pinkie Pie  Funny joke! 
    Apple Bloom No, really! Let- us- in! 
    Pinkie Pie Ohhh! Here! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Babs! You gotta get out of that float! 
    Babs Seed You're not getting your float back, crybabies! 
    Sweetie Belle But it's booby traâ€“ 
     
    Pinkie Pie Veggie salad! 
    Apple Bloom Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie Veggie salad! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Apple Bloom Seriously? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hey! Don't leave me!  
     
     
    Babs Seed What theâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom Babs! Babs! 
    Babs Seed Oof! 
    Apple Bloom  Oooh, sweet applesauce! 
     
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Apple Bloom Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time. 
     
    Applejack Are y'all okay? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah... we're fine. 
    Scootaloo No sweat. 
    Babs Seed After I'd been so mean to ya... you saved me! 
    Apple Bloom  About that... 

    Babs Seed I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake! 
    Scootaloo Except... we were the reason it was headed into the lake. 
    Sweetie Belle We booby trapped the float. 
    Apple Bloom Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully... 
    Scootaloo But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan. 
    Sweetie Belle And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?! 
    Apple Bloom Guess what we're trying to say is... 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders We're sorry. 
    Babs Seed  I'm sorry too. 
    Applejack  Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning. 
    Sweetie Belle That's what I kept on saying! 
    Babs Seed So... can we... start over? 
    Apple Bloom Definitely. 
    Scootaloo Yeah. 

     
    Sweetie Belle "We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..." 
    Scootaloo  
    Sweetie Belle Well you wrote this. 
    Scootaloo Oh, uh, yeah... 
    Sweetie Belle "Homegirl... Amiga..." Blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, yes, here. "...and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes... boss-om buddies... compadres..." 
    Scootaloo Congratulations!  Gotta remember to revise that. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Babs Seed  

    Apple Bloom So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right? 
    Babs Seed Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home. 
    Applejack Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear? 
    Diamond Tiara So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks. 
    Babs Seed Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends! 
    Silver Spoon F-friends? 
    Babs Seed Yeah, you got a problem with that? 
    Diamond Tiara Well, what if I do? What are you gonna do about it? 
    Babs Seed Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes! 
     
     
    Sweetie Belle I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed. 
    Applejack Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now? 
    Sweetie Belle No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good. Get it? 
    Applejack Yea... No. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     

     
     

Magic Duel

     
     
     
     
    Shopkeeper May I help you, traveler? Hmm, something drew you to my shop... something powerful. Ah, you have a keen eye. The Alicorn Amulet is one of the most mysterious and powerful of all the known magical charms. Uh, ahâ€” I'm afraid this is... far too dangerous. 
     
    Shopkeeper  Would you like that gift-wrapped? 

     

    Fluttershy Don't be scared, little friends. Twilight is wonderful with magic.  Anything happens to them, Twilight, so help me... 
    Spike Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack with a giant snowball. 
    Fluttershy Of course she's good with magic. Twilight's great with magic. I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared. Oh, oh, look how scared they are! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I promise, Fluttershy. Nothing bad will happen to them. 
    Fluttershy  I know! Stop, stop! They can't take it! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Spike Twilight, that looks amazing! 
    Twilight Sparkle Phew! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle That's all for now, little ones. Maybe we can practice again later, if Fluttershy says it's alright. 
     
    Spike Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight. Princess Celestia's going to love it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, Spike. I have to be at my best when she arrives with the delegates from Saddle Arabia. I can't believe she's trusting me with the entertainment. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Twilight! Come quick! It's an emergency! 

     
    Rarity  You beast! This shade of brown should only be used for accents! 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, Applejack. We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on here? 
    Trixie Well, well, well. If it isn't... Twilight Sparkle. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Trixie! 
    Spike What's she doing here? 
    Rainbow Dash You call that great and powerful? 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Snips Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now! 
    Snails Yeah! Ha ha ha ha! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Snails Good spell, oh Great and Powerful Trixie! 
    Trixie You two! Quiet! 
     
    Snips Uh, hey! Wâ€” What happened? 
    Snails Get off of me! Brbrbr. 
    Snips Let go! 
    Snails Go this way! 
    Twilight Sparkle Stop picking on my friends, Trixie! 
    Trixie You and I have some unfinished business. My magic's gotten better since I was here last. And I'm going to prove it! Me and you, a magic duel. Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle Forget it! I'd never make a deal like that! 
    Trixie Hm. Your choice. 
    Spike  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this? 
    Trixie Why? Because you humiliated me! After you showed me up with that Ursa Minor, I became a laughing stock! Everywhere I went I was laughed at and ostracized. I even had to take a job on a rock farm just to earn a living! A rock farm! 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! You're lucky a rock farm would take the likes of you! 
     
    Trixie Now I want revenge! And I'll just keep casting spells 'til you agree. Well? What do you say? 
     
    Spike Whoooaah! Help... me! 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, Trixie. Let's duel! 
    Trixie Excellent. 
     
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Trixie If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again. But if you lose, you're the one banished from this one-horse town! 
    Rest of main cast  
     
    Trixie Draw! 
     
     
    Shoeshine  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Rest of main cast  
     
    Trixie Snips, Snails, step forward! 
    Snips Whâ€” what is it, oh Great and Pâ€” Pâ€” Powerful Trixie?  
    Baby Snips  
    Twilight Sparkle An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns! 
     
    Trixie Well, Twilight? Give up? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Baby Snips  
    Spike Come on, Twilight, you can do it! 
     
     
    Baby Snips  
    Old Snails  
    Trixie Trixie is the highest level unicorn!  And now it's time for you to leave Ponyville! FOREVER! 
    Applejack That's enough, Trixie! 
    Rarity You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville! 
    Trixie You fools! She's already gone! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's something strange about her. 
    Spike Twilight?  

    Twilight Sparkle  Ugh! It's impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I know who understands strange and powerful magic? 

     
    Zecora Your tale of woe upsets me so.  No wonder you're dour. It's an abuse of power! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn. 
    Zecora  If you train with me, so good you'll be. I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay. 
    Twilight Sparkle You'll train me in magic? But she was doing age spells, weather spells, you name it! 
    Zecora When it comes to magic, it would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially Trixie. 
    Twilight Sparkle You really think I can beat her? 
    Zecora Mm-hmm. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, when do we start? 

     
    Trixie You two! Hurry up with my throne. 
     
    Trixie And you, how long do I have to wait for my applesauce facial? 
    Applejack Forget it, Trixie! I ain't doing nothin' 'til you let Twilight come home!  Okay, I'll do it! Just make it stop! Hoo! 
     
    Trixie I thought I told you to dance! 
    Rarity Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville. Ow!  Oh, somepony has to help us! 

     
    Zecora Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned. Only then can victory be earned. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Trixie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Zecora There is much, much that I can teach, but the answer you need may still be out of reach. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean and nasty. 
    Zecora Your thinking needs a readjust. Total concentration is a must. 

     
     
    Rarity Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack I hear you, Pinkie. I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'. 
    Spike Ugh, there must be something! Twilight has every magic book there is! 
    Fluttershy  Um, I think I may have found something? 
    Rarity Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville. 
    Fluttershy  Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magicâ€“ 
    Applejack She wants me to grow apples with no peels! Now how the hay am I supposed to do that? 
    Fluttershy  Um, there's a picture here of that necklaceâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy  It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untoldâ€” 
    Spike Hey, everypony, look! This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace! It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers! 
    Fluttershy  If you read a little further, you'll seeâ€” 
    Rarity  Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user! 
    Fluttershy  Yes, but, um, you can'tâ€” 
    Spike  You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck, it has a magical lock! Trixie's the only pony who can take it off! 
    Fluttershy  Maybe we couldâ€” 
    Applejack We need to get this information to Twilight. She'll know what to do. 
    Fluttershy  But, hâ€” howâ€” 
    Rarity If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her! 
    Fluttershy  Maybe we shouldâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash I've got it! Trying to sneak past the force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the goods to get into those woods! 
    Fluttershy  Itâ€” it must beâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Whaaat?! 
     
    Applejack What do you say, Fluttershy? Can you handle the mission? 
    Fluttershy No! I'll crack under the pressure! I'll snap like a twig! 
    Rainbow Dash Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight. 
    Fluttershy Butâ€” but Iâ€” 
     
    Fluttershy  Okay. 
    Applejack Alright! 
    Other ponies and Spike  
    Rarity I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit! 

    Snips and Snails  
    Trixie Pull, you fools!  Somepony set off the magic force field, and Trixie intends to punish them! 
    Snips  But... wouldn't it be faster if we had some... wheels?! 
    Trixie The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels. Now pull faster! 
    Snails  I'm telling ya, Snips, she's getting weirder and weirder! 
     
    Snips and Snails  
    Trixie Stop! You there! What are you doing?! 
     
     
     
    Snails Gah, why is she so mean to us? 
    Snips Yeah! I miss the days when she was just a fraud! 
     
     
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh, oh dear! Rarity's dangerous mission outfit is ruined! Guess we'd better go back!  
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh, okay, okay, you're right. I need to be brave and find Twilight. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! Yâ€” you found her? 
     
    Fluttershy She's in the Everfree Forest?! 
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh, this is me being brave! I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear! 

     
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet! 
    Fluttershy The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her! 
    Twilight Sparkle But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough! 
    Zecora Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done. You learned all of my lessons; all but one. If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix, you must nix your magic and use the six. 
    Twilight Sparkle Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy. 
     

     
    Trixie This better not be another false alarm, or the Great and Powerful Trixie willâ€“  What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle? Not enjoying your exile? 
    Twilight Sparkle I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated. 
    Trixie Cheated? Moi? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a real magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me.  and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet! 
    Trixie Ha! Nothing's more powerful than the Alicorn Amulet! And nopony's more powerful than the Great and Powerful Trixie! 
    Twilight Sparkle  How about another duel? 
    Trixie  Why should I? I already beat you. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora. 
    Trixie Wait! 
     
    Trixie Okay, okay, you're on! A second duel. 

     
     
     
    Trixie Let's start with a simple age spell, shall we? 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's. 
    Trixie Snips, Snails. 
     
    Baby Snips and Baby Snails  
    Trixie An oldie, but a goodie, ha. Now, let's see what your little charm can do. 
    Twilight Sparkle No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please? 
    Applejack Huh? 
    Rarity Huh? 
     
     
    Trixie Oh, ho-hum. So you can do an age spell, big deal. 
     
     
     
     
    Trixie That's... That's impossible! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's nothing! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yow! 
    Trixie How did youâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Duplication spell. Ever see one pony play ten instruments? 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Trixie This... just can't be! 
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion. 
     
    Big McIntosh (as Male Applejack) (nervously) Eeyup. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yoursâ€“ Hey! Give it back! 
    Trixie  With this amulet, I shall now rule all of Equestria! 
     
     
     
    Trixie Witness, my subjects. Gaze upon an ever greater and 'powerful-er' Trixie! 
     
    Trixie Hey!  I don't need that old Alicorn Amulet. I have this! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Stop it! Thaâ€” that tickles! 
    Trixie Tickles?! That was supposed to make you writhe in agony! This amulet is defective!  Give mine back! 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry. This is going back into hiding where it belongs. 
    Twilight Sparkle By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops. 
     
    Trixie  But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic â€“ the magic of friendship. I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you. 
    Trixie But... what about the pony with the ten instruments? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
     

     
    Saddle Arabian delegates Oooh! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Trixie? 
    Trixie It's the least I could do. I treated you and your friends so horribly when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet. I just couldn't control myself. You can forgive me, can't you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmmm. Sure. 
    Trixie Oh, good. Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you've ever seen?! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Pinkie Pie  

     
     

Sleepless in Ponyville

     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Scootaloo Whoo-hoo! 
    Rainbow Dash  Nice moves, kid. 
    Scootaloo Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've gotâ€“ 
     
    Scootaloo  ...nice moves! 
    Bessie  

     

    Scootaloo ...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, "Nice moves, kid." 
    Apple Bloom Woooow. 
    Sweetie Belle She really said that? 
    Scootaloo I mean, it's like she practically told me she wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and become like my big sister! 
    Apple Bloom I dunno about all that. 
    Sweetie Belle It was a really nice compliment and all, but... 
    Scootaloo I know, I know. But all that stuff I said could happen, right? 
    Apple Bloom Sure. 
    Sweetie Belle Absolutely. 
    Scootaloo I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my awesomeness. 
    Apple Bloom Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too! 
    Scootaloo Really?! 
    Apple Bloom Sure! 
    Sweetie Belle I wanna go... 
    Apple Bloom Well, duh, of course you can go! 
    Sweetie Belle And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping! 

    Rarity I despise camping! All of that...  ...nature. 
    Sweetie Belle Applejack's going with her little sister. But, y'know, if you don't wanna spend time with me...  
    Rarity Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh! 
    Sweetie Belle See? Told you she'd wanna go. 

     
    Applejack You packed bug spray? 
    Apple Bloom Yup. You got the canteens? 
    Applejack Yup. Looks like we're all set then. 
     
    Rarity Hey! 
    Applejack Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack? 
    Rarity Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler. 
    Applejack Well, looks like we're all set now. 
    Scootaloo But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming? 
    Applejack 'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite. 
    Scootaloo Oh. 
    Applejack Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out! 

    Rarity Oh, are we there yet? 
    Applejack The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up there right now. 
     
     
     
    Scootaloo  Hey Raiâ€“ 
     
     
    Scootaloo  Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up? 
    Rainbow Dash What took you guys so long? 
    Applejack Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh? 
    Scootaloo Heh, if that's okay with you. 
    Rainbow Dash Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you? 
    Scootaloo Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or  night in my life. 
    Rainbow Dash Then you and I are gonna get along just fine. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash You have got to be kidding me. 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase. 
    Rainbow Dash  Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire? 
    Scootaloo Of course! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard. 
    Scootaloo Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom? 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest.  You like scary stories, right? 
    Scootaloo  Mm-hmm. 
    Rainbow Dash It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this... 

    Rainbow Dash ...And then, The Olden Pony asked,  "Who's got my rusty horseshoe?" 
    Sweetie Belle Not me! 
     
    Rainbow Dash You do! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Scootaloo  Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story. 
    Rainbow Dash Knew you wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me â€“ fearless. 
    Scootaloo  
     
    Rarity  Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh! 
    Applejack  Think it's about time for me to hit the straw. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent. 
    Scootaloo  Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh! 
    Rainbow Dash That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age! 
     
    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it. 
     
     
    Scootaloo  It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination... 
     
    Scootaloo  And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony... 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Scootaloo I-Is anyone out there? 
     
     
    The Olden Pony  
    Scootaloo  
    The Olden Pony Who got my rusty horseshoe? 
    Scootaloo  
     
     
    Scootaloo  
    The Olden Pony Who's got my rusty horseshoe? 
    Scootaloo  Rainbow Dashâ€“? 
    The Olden Pony You do! 
    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Scootaloo  

    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash  I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly. 
    Scootaloo  Best night ever. 
    Rainbow Dash Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls. 
     
    Scootaloo Yeah... Totally...  

    Rarity Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! I think I'm sweating! Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time! 
    Applejack I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite! 
    Scootaloo  I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after dark, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Doesn't matter to me. 
    Scootaloo Well, y'know,  it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh. 

    Scootaloo  
     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Crocodile  
    Bear  
    Rarity  That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing. 
    Scootaloo  Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes. 

     
    Scootaloo  
     
     
    Applejack You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh. 
     
    Scootaloo  
    Applejack You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy. 
    Scootaloo Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh. 
     
     
    Scootaloo Uh, d-do you need a little help? 
    Rarity That's so sweet, thank you. 
    Scootaloo Um... what are friends for?  

     
    Applejack No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave. 
    Rainbow Dash All right! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go. 
    Scootaloo  Uh, of course... 
     
    Scootaloo  I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest! 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks. 
     
    Scootaloo  Here, branches branches branches... 
    Applejack Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo  Here you go! 
    Rainbow Dash That's it? 
    Scootaloo It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here! 
    Applejack It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Now, where was I? Oh yeah, the  
    Scootaloo Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story? 
    Rainbow Dash Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one. 
    Scootaloo There once was a really really nice pony who lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, and lots and lots of happy friends, andâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking.  I've been told that these very woods are haunted... 
    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash  ...by The Headless Horse! It gallops only at nightâ€“ 
    Applejack If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'? 
    Rainbow Dash It's headless, not brainless.  ...looking for little lost poniesâ€“ 
    Applejack So where's its brain? 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh.  

    Rainbow Dash  ...and they were never heard from ever again! 
    Sweetie Belle  Never? 
    Rainbow Dash Never. 
     
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  
    Scootaloo  
    Rarity Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight. 
    Scootaloo It's not time for bed yet, is it? 
    Applejack 'Fraid so, Scootaloo. 
    Scootaloo Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet!  
    Sweetie Belle You don't have to ask me twice! 
     
    Sweetie Belle  
    Other ponies  
    Rarity Good night, Sweetie Belle. 
    Applejack Good night, y'all. 
    Apple Bloom Good night, y'all. 
    Rainbow Dash Sleep tight. 
    Scootaloo Oh, just one more song! Anyone?  How about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with me? 
    Apple Bloom  Maybe tomorrow. 
    Scootaloo Aww. 
    Applejack Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why? 
    Scootaloo Pfft, of course not! I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep!  Heh, silly sleep. 
    Rainbow Dash That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now! 
    Scootaloo Ugh, this is so unfair...  
     

     
     
     
    Scootaloo  Woah! 
     
    Scootaloo It's all over!  

    Scootaloo  Aaah! 
    Princess Luna  A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo. 
     
    Scootaloo Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse! 
    Princess Luna You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed. 
    Scootaloo You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot? 
    Princess Luna I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams. 
    Scootaloo Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real! 
     
    Princess Luna I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist. 
    Scootaloo  Eh... The Headless Horse? 
    Princess Luna Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most? 
    Scootaloo Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am. 
    Princess Luna Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way. But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue. 
    Scootaloo  
     
    Princess Luna Face your fears! 

    Scootaloo â€“Princess Luna?!  It was just a dream. 
     
    Scootaloo  But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods! 
     
    Scootaloo It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse!  
    Rainbow Dash  

    Scootaloo  So it's a horse without a head... which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a horse without a head! 
     
    Scootaloo Whoa, whoa!  
     
     
    Scootaloo Hello?! Is anyone out there?  Anyone except The Headless Horse? 
     
    Scootaloo Heellllpâ€“ 
     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Rainbow Dash I gotcha! 
    Scootaloo Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you! 
    Rainbow Dash What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?! 
    Princess Luna  It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo! 
    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those stories... I was scared too. 
    Scootaloo  You were? 
    Rainbow Dash Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh? 
    Scootaloo Mm-hmm. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I might be up for something like that. 
    Scootaloo Really? 
    Rainbow Dash As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night. 
    Scootaloo  It's a deal! 

     
    Sweetie Belle I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot! 
    Rarity Ugh, if you insist.  It is so on! 
    Rainbow Dash They think they can beat the two of us? 
    Scootaloo  

    The Olden Pony  Who's got my rusty horseshoe? 
    Rainbow Dash Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning. 
    The Olden Pony Thank you, and have a nice day. 
    Princess Luna  

     
     

Wonderbolts Academy

    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already! I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm not nervous at all. When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy... 
    Pinkie Pie IF you get in! If you get in! Don't jinx it! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm telling you, it's in the bag. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't jinx it! 
    Applejack She is the best flyer in Ponyville. 
    Rainbow Dash In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day. 
    Messenger Pony Got a letter here for Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash I... didn't get in. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in! 
    Pinkie Pie I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... thanks? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie? I kinda need to get going. 
    Pinkie Pie Okay. I'm done! 
    Rainbow Dash The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff! See you guys in a week! 
    Applejack Good luck! 
    Rainbow Dash Won't need it! 
     
    Pinkie Pie DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!!!  Do you think she heard me? 

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah! This is gonna be sweet! 

    Spitfire Well, lookie what we got here. Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya? 
    All Pegasi Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer? 
    All Pegasi Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Well then. Let me be the first to tell you... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt! Still think you're something special? 
    Cloudchaser No, ma'am! 
    Spitfire  You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy! You'll probably quit after the first day! 
    Rainbow Dash No, ma'am! I'd never quit, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded. 
    Lightning Dust Try me, ma'am. 
    Spitfire What's that? 
    Lightning Dust Let me show you what I've got, ma'am. 
    Spitfire Ah. You want a chance to prove yourself, huh? 
    Lightning Dust Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Well then, now's your chance. Give me five hundred laps! All of you! 
     
    Spitfire Now!  

     
    Spitfire Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine! 
    Rainbow Dash One more lap to go! 
    Lightning Dust You're on! 
    Spitfire Five hundred! 
     
    Spitfire Not bad... for a couple of newbies. 
    Lightning Dust Name's Lightning Dust. 
    Rainbow Dash Rainbow Dash! 
    Lightning Dust Wanna grab some grub in the mess hall? 
    Rainbow Dash Definitely. 

     
    Applejack Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet. Give her a chance to settle in first. Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to? I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells! 
    Pinkie Pie New spells, huh? Okay. Wait! If I'm not here when Rainbow Dash's letter arrives, I won't be able to read it right away. And if I don't read it right away, I won't be able to write her back right away. And if I don't write her back right away, she might think I didn't get her letter, and then she might worry it got lost. And if she's worrying about her letter, she'll be distracted. And if she's distracted, then she won't do well at the academy! And if she doesn't do well at the academy, then she'll get kicked out! And if she gets kicked out, they'll never let her be a Wonderbolt! And if she doesn't get to be a Wonderbolt, all her dreams will be crushed! And it will be all... my... fault!  
    Applejack So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox. 
    Pinkie Pie Yep! 
    Applejack Suit yourself. 
     

    Spitfire The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world. But spin-outs can still happen. And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly. This... is the Dizzitron. It's gonna make you very â€“ I repeat â€“ very dizzy. Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who's first?  You. You're up. 
    Meadow Flower Me? 
    Spitfire Now! Ready? 
    Meadow Flower Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Go! 
     
    Spitfire Release! 
    Meadow Flower  
    Spitfire Huh. Fifteen seconds. Decent, but I wouldn't go writin' home about it! Who's next? Alright, Rainbow Dash. Let's see what you got. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Okay, go! 
     
    Spitfire Release! Six seconds? That's an academy record. 
    Meadow Flower You made it look so easy. 
    Rainbow Dash I make everything look easy. 
    Spitfire Okay, Lightning Dust. You're up. 
    Lightning Dust Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed? I wanna push my limits. 
    Spitfire You sure about that? 
    Lightning Dust Yes ma'am. 
    Spitfire Okay. You asked for it. 
     
    Spitfire Release! Six point five seconds. Not bad. 
    Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust Heh!/Oh yeah! 
    Spitfire Next! 

     
    Rainbow Dash No pony even came close to six seconds. 
    Lightning Dust They should make us Wonderbolts right now. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, they should. 
    Spitfire Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs. 'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony. Good luck. 
    Lightning Dust Like we're going to need it. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, yeah. 

    Rainbow Dash So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony? What? 
    Cloudchaser Eh, you might want to check the wall. 
    Rainbow Dash A wingpony? 
    Lightning Dust They made us a team! Isn't that awesome? 

     
    Rainbow Dash Permission to enter, ma'am. 
    Spitfire What is it, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash I had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds! 
    Spitfire And? 
    Rainbow Dash And you made me a wingpony! 
    Spitfire Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team. Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am. 
    Spitfire Then what's the problem? 
    Rainbow Dash I think I should be lead pony, ma'am. 
    Spitfire And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. Got it? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am. 
    Spitfire Good. 

    Spitfire Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We'll divide you into two teams, red... and blue. Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins. 
     
    Meadow Flower Oh, this is gonna be so much fun! 
    Spitfire If you think this is gonna to be fun, you are sadly mistaken. This is for training purposes. This is not recess. Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand? 
    All Pegasi Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Then let's go!  
    Lightning Dust Ready to rock and roll? 
    Rainbow Dash Ready. 
    Lightning Dust You spotted any flags yet? 
    Rainbow Dash Not yet. Oh! There's one! 
    Lightning Dust Good eyes! 
    Rainbow Dash We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed! 
    Lightning Dust Peh. 
    Rainbow Dash Ow! 
    Spitfire Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag! 
    Lightning Dust Come on! Let's find some more! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, sure. Just give me a second. 
    Lightning Dust Oh, you're fine. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah... totally.  

    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Rarity She's still at it. 
    Fluttershy I just wish we could help her. 
    Pinkie Pie Help me? The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash! It's been three days already. By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore! She probably can't remember our faces! "Pinkie Pie? I never heard of a Pinkie Pie! Who is Pinkie Pie?" 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first? 
    Pinkie Pie Of course! That's a great idea! 
    Fluttershy, Rarity, and Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie Oh wait! I got an even better idea! How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package? You know, before she forgets all about us? Although, come on, let's face it. It's probably too late for that. But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea. 
    Pinkie Pie A care package it is! We'll send it through the mail! WAIT! Ah! That won't work at all! 
    Applejack Why not? 
    Pinkie Pie Because what if the package gets lost in the mail? What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend? And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them! 
    Applejack Is anypony else followin' this? 
    Fluttershy, Twilight, and Rarity Mmm-mm. 
    Pinkie Pie I've got it! We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person! 
    Rarity I wouldn't mind a little trip. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll go! 
    Applejack Count me in! 
    Fluttershy Me too. 
    Pinkie Pie Me five! But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It may take a while for her to get her memory back. 

     
    Spitfire Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course. 
     
    Spitfire The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances. And don't worry about winning. It's not a race. Now everypony, get on your marks!  
     
     
    Lightning Dust Ugh! Can't they go any faster? It's no good, I can't get around them! 
    Rainbow Dash Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves! 
    Lightning Dust I guess... 
     
    Lightning Dust What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather. 
     
    Lightning Dust Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes! 
     
     
    Spitfire Not bad! And in record time, too! Definitely made the right decision making you two a team. The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out. Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early? 
    Lightning Dust Yes, ma'am! 
    Rainbow Dash Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that. 
    Lightning Dust Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out. You saw them on the Dizzitron! They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys! Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I-I guess you're right... 
    Lightning Dust 'Course I'm right! Now let's go fuel up! Kicking all that tail has made me hungry. 

     
     
    Bulk Biceps  Yeah! 
    Lightning Dust I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition. 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Rainbow Dash But we're already way ahead. 
    Lightning Dust Are you in or not? 
    Spitfire  Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. 
    Rainbow Dash I'm in! 
    Lightning Dust Then follow my lead! 
     
    Lightning Dust I can't control it! 
    Applejack It's a twister! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hold on! 
    Rainbow Dash Noooooo! 
    Rest of main cast  
     
    Rest of main cast  Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash Are you guys okay? 
    Rarity, Twilight, Applejack and Fluttershy Uh-huh. 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie You... remember me! 
    Rainbow Dash Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here? 
    Applejack We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill. 
    Lightning Dust That... was... awesome! 
    Rainbow Dash Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces! 
    Lightning Dust Yeah, but they weren't, right? Can't say the same for the clouds. We totally wiped them out with that tornado. The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did. 
    Rainbow Dash A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends! 
    Lightning Dust Yeah, and? 
    Rainbow Dash And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way. 
    Lightning Dust The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so. After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony. 
    Rainbow Dash  You're right. She did. 

     
    Spitfire This better be important. You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner. 
    Rainbow Dash We're done with that, ma'am. 
    Spitfire Already? That's an academy record! Explain your methods. 
    Rainbow Dash That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado. 
    Spitfire A bit excessive for cloud-busting. But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well that "effective tactic" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it. 
    Spitfire What are you saying, newbie? 
    Rainbow Dash I quit. 
     

    Applejack You did what?! 
    Rarity Being a Wonderbolt was your dream! 
    Rainbow Dash Not anymore. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you. 
    Spitfire Rainbow Dash! How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond! The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves. It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown that you're capable of doing just that. You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash. You're a leader. 
    Rainbow Dash OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh! 
    Spitfire Now get out there and give me twenty! 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package! 

     
     

Apple Family Reunion

    Applejack Ha! Found 'em! 
    Granny Smith Aaa-choooo! 
    Applejack Heh. Gesundhoof. 
    Granny Smith Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday. 
    Applejack Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then. 
    Granny Smith Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion? 
    Apple Bloom Everypony! 
    Granny Smith Everypony?  Are you sure? 
    Apple Bloom Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa! 
    Granny Smith Guh? 
    Apple Bloom Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin! 
    Granny Smith I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough. 

     

    Granny Smith Whooeee! Looks like the family's grown tenfold since the last reunion! I'm gonna be busier than a worm in a rotten tomater tryin' to get everything ready! 
    Applejack I could always help out. 
    Apple Bloom Me, too! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Granny Smith Oh, I sure would appreciate that. Granny's a little rustier in the giddy-up since the last time the Apples all got together. 
    Applejack You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as everâ€“ 
    Granny Smith Who you callin' old?! 
    Applejack Uh... I just meant... Why don't you let me take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round? Then all you need to worry about is enjoyin' yourself. 
    Granny Smith Hmmm. Alright, young'un, you got yourself a deal. You are in charge. 
    Applejack I won't let you down, Granny. You just tell me what the reunion needs, and I'll take care of the rest. 
    Granny Smith I'll do better than tell you what the reunion'll need. I'll show ya! 

    Granny Smith We've been hostin' these things at Sweet Apple Acres every hundred moons since we first planted roots here in Ponyville. 
    Apple Bloom Hey, who's that? 
    Granny Smith That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars. 
    Apple Bloom Hey! That's you, Granny! 
    Granny Smith Sure is. Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion. 

    Young Granny Smith I can do it! Ngh! Oh, fingle-fangle! 
     

    Apple Bloom  
    Granny Smith Well, nopony told me you actually had to knot the end of the thread! 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread... You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion? 
    Granny Smith Surely have. I don't think we're ever gonna finish that doggone thing! 
    Apple Bloom Hey, what's goin' on here? 
    Granny Smith Well, you know us Apples enjoy a good fritter... 

     
    Half Baked Apple  Ooo, hot hot hot! 
     
     
     
    Apple Split Hey, where did all them apple fritters go? 
    Baby Applejack  
    Apple Split And... 
    Baby Applejack  
    Apple Split Who are you, little one? 
    Baby Applejack I'm Applejack! More apple fwitter? 

    Granny Smith That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion. 
    Applejack Better get twice as much honey and flour, then... fifty more buckets of apples... more oil... wood for the fire... 
    Granny Smith Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump! This one sure brings back memories. Y'know how Babs is your favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine. The two of us entered the seven-legged race every reunion! 

    Young Apple Rose We're gonna win this one, cousin! 
    Young Granny Smith You bet your hot-diggety-derriere we are! C'mon, cousin, speed'er on up! 
    Young Apple Rose  
    Young Apple Rose and Young Granny Smith  

    Granny Smith Never won a single one of them races. 
    Applejack Races. We'll need cloth ties, finish line... Not much to a seven-legged race. Hmm... 
    Granny Smith And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, let's us see how our family's grown! 
    Applejack Photo in front of the barn. Got it. 
    Apple Bloom You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha? 
    Granny Smith Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one? 
    Applejack That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round. Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started... I've got some plannin' to do! 
    Granny Smith Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head? 
    Apple Bloom and Granny Smith  

     
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up? 
    Apple Bloom I was gonna ask you the same thing. 
    Applejack I can't sleep. My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion! 
    Apple Bloom  Yeah... I can't wait to see my cousin Babs. We're gonna do so many fun things together... 
    Applejack Fun? That's just the beginnin' of it! Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it. Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest! 
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack Trust me, little sis. This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait. 
    Apple Bloom  

     
    Apple Bloom  Whoa! 
    Applejack Rise and shine! We don't have much time! 
     
     

     

     
    Pinkie Pie  Don't forget the glitter! 
    Applejack  

     
     
    Rainbow Dash  

    Spike  

    Applejack H-ah. Think that'll do it! 
    Granny Smith And just in time, too. 
     
    Applejack They're here! 
     
    Granny Smith Apple Rose! Ohhh! Ooh, this is more excitin' than when it rained frogs! 
     
    Applejack  Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion! 
     
    Applejack  My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya! We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns. And there's lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it! 
     
    Apple Bloom Where is she? 
    Babs Seed  
    Apple Bloom Babs! 
    Babs Seed Cuz! 
    Apple Bloom I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, butâ€“ 
    Apple Bloom and Babs Seed â€“It felt like forever! 
    Babs Seed I can't wait to tell you about my new school! 
    Apple Bloom I can't wait to hear all about it! 
    Babs Seed Jeepers, where do I start? Okay. So first dayâ€“ 
    Applejack Babs! Huh, so glad you could come! 
    Babs Seed What am I, gonna miss out on spendin' time with my favorite cousin? Forget about it!  
    Applejack Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course? 
    Apple Bloom We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first... 
    Applejack Don't you worry. There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins. 

    Applejack Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun? 
    Babs Seed Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'! 
    Applejack Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race. 
    Apple Bloom There's more? 
    Applejack Much more. Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget. After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples! 
     
    Applejack Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy. Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles. And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' "Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets" over and over and over again. Last pony standin' wins! 
     
    Apple Bloom Seriously? 
    Applejack Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark... get set... go! 

    Applejack Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt. 

    Granny Smith How long you had those new choppers, Auntie Applesauce? 
    Auntie Applesauce A lady never reveals the age of her teeth. 
    Apple Rose Ugh. 
    Auntie Applesauce Don't you roll your eyes at me, Miss Apple Rose! I imagine you two think I have forgotten what you did to my parasol six reunions ago? 
    Granny Smith  We were just usin' it to help break open that piÃ±ata! 
    Apple Rose and Granny Smith  
    Auntie Applesauce Applejack, delightful to see you. Are you gonna join us in some quiltin'? 
    Applejack Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy. Y'all should get started, though! 
    Granny Smith We couldn't find our rocking chairs. 
    Applejack I got rid of 'em to make room for these. This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt! 
    Apple Rose Finish it? 
     
     
     
    Applejack  Won't that be excitin'? 
    Apple Rose  What's that? 
    Applejack  I said, won't that beâ€“ 
     
    Applejack â€“excitin'? 
    Auntie Applesauce I suppose, although I have been told that too much excitement can wreak havoc on this youthful complexion of mine. 
    Apple Rose Oh. 
    Granny Smith  
     
    Applejack  That's the spirit! 
    Granny Smith  What did she say? 
    Apple Rose  What? 
    Granny Smith  Good gracious! 
    Apple Rose  Golden Delicious? I think he's racing with his cousin! 

     
    Babs Seed  How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle? 
    Apple Bloom  Great! Ugh... 
    Babs Seed  You alright? 
    Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom Ugh... 
    Babs Seed  

     
    Big McIntosh  
    Apple Dumpling You've got eight now, dont'cha? 
    Apple Leaves Oh, sure do. Tell you what, my Apple Tart may just be a baby, but he is a hoot! 
    Applejack Havin' fun? 
    Apple Leaves Sure are! 
    Applejack Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Now you try! That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria! 

    Apple Bloom and Babs Seed Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. 
    Apple Bloom Any other blank flanks at your new school? 
    Babs Seed Yeah. Two. 
    Apple Bloom and Babs Seed Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. 
    Apple Bloom Do they wanna be Crusaders? 
    Babs Seed Totally! 
    Apple Bloom Great! 
    Apple Bloom and Babs Seed Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. 
    Babs Seed Ah can' thfeel my tongue. 
    Apple Bloom Neh nehber. 

    Applejack  Alright, Apples, break! 
     
    Apple Bloom  Finally... 
    Applejack Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album! Huh. Nothin' all that memorable there. Or there. Or there. C'mon, Applejack, think. You gotta kick this thing up a notch! Hm... 

    Apple Bloom I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous! 
    Babs Seed I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out! 
    Applejack And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them. 
    Apple Bloom Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk! 
    Applejack There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride. 
    Babs Seed Hayride? 

    Applejack Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories. And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm. Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'. So let's get this show on the road! Giddy-up! 
    Stallions  
    Ponies Whoa! 
     
     
     
    Auntie Applesauce  I just had those professionally polished. 
    Granny Smith Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Granny Smith What?! I was jokin'! Why, we haven't tended those fields since all the trees went and got filled up with...  
     
     
     
    Babs Seed Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before! 
     
     
     
    Applejack Uh-oh. 
    Auntie Applesauce  
     
    Apple Bloom Everypony! Jump out!! 
     

     
    Applejack  Ruined. Everythin' is ruined. 
     
    Applejack Oh, Granny. I'm so, so sorry. 
    Granny Smith Oh, it's alright, child. 
    Applejack But it's not alright. Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed! 
    Apple Bloom Maybe that's a good thing. 
    Applejack How can that possibly be a good thing? 
    Granny Smith Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with! 
    Applejack Really? 
     
    Applejack  Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion... is that it was the worst one we ever had. 
    Granny Smith Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em. 
    Applejack The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year... unless... Everypony! I have one more activity! 
    Granny Smith Applejack... 
    Applejack Trust me, Granny Smith. This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons.

    Babs Seed  Obviously. 
    Granny Smith Oh, you did it, Applejack! You put on a reunion that everypony will remember! 
    Applejack Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way. 
    Granny Smith Yeah, just a couple. 

    Granny Smith Ohohoh, that's a good one. 
    Apple Bloom and Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom Oh! 

    Applejack Dear Princess Celestia, 
    Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you think about it, is really the first group of friends you ever make. Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the "who" long after you've forgotten the "what". 

    Your humble subject, 
    Applejack 

     
     

Spike at Your Service

    Spike Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh. That's not that many. 
    Spike Are you kidding? How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend? 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down. 
    Spike Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off? 
    Spike Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle Why not? These books are gonna keep me busy for a while. 
    Spike Hmm... I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do! 

    Spike "Touch nose with tongue." Eeeng... done! "Play bongos on my belly." 
     
    Spike Done! "Smell my dirty feet."  Done! Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would. 

     

    Spike What to do, what to do... 
     
    Spike  A hot air balloon ride! 
     
    Spike  Oh no! Wait! Runaway balloon! Gah! 
     
    Spike  Sorry! 
     
    Spike  
     

    Spike  That was a close one. I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest. 
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
     
    Applejack Come 'n' get me, ya big goons!  Run! 
    Spike I'm running! I'm running! 
     
    Spike  
    Applejack Whew! 
    Spike Wow, Applejack! That was amazing! I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were... rockets! Pow, pow, pow pow pow! You saved my life!  You... saved... my life. 
    Applejack Aw, don't mention it, Spike. C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now. 
    Spike Man, am I lucky you were out here. Uh, why were you out here? 
    Applejack Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate. Guess you did too, huh? 
    Spike Uh... yeah... I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too! So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh? 
     

    Applejack Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike. That was mighty kind of you. But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later. 
    Spike What chores? I'll do them! 
    Applejack That's sweet, but you don't haveâ€“ 
    Spike It's the least I can do! You saved my life! I need to repay the favor. 
    Applejack Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other. You don't need to repay the favor. 
    Spike Yes, I do! 
    Applejack Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary. 
    Spike Applejack, you don't understand! This is something I really need to do! 
    Applejack Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do... 
    Spike Great! What should I do? 
    Applejack Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath. I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead. 
    Spike On the double! 

    Spike Applejack said I could help you! 
     
    Apple Bloom Great! I could use all the help I can get! 
     
    Spike Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle! 

     
    Spike Ta-da! 
     
    Applejack Good job, you two. 
    Apple Bloom Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'? I don't wanna be late for my Crusaders meeting. We're gettin' fitted for water skis! 
    Applejack Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that. 
    Apple Bloom Water skiin' cutie mark, here I come! 
    Applejack Spike, you can head on out too. I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven. 
    Spike What? Ohhh no. We aren't even close to being even Steven! Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further! 
    Applejack I dunno, Spike. Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me. 
    Spike Please? 
    Applejack Really, you don'tâ€“ 
    Spike Pretty please? 
    Applejack It's just not necessaryâ€“ 
    Spike Pretty pretty pretty please? 
    Applejack  Oh, all right. You can help Granny Smith and me bake someâ€“ 

    Spike Pies! Pies! I'm helping Applejack make some pies! 
    Granny Smith Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs? 
    Spike Coming right up!  
     
    Spike Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack. Lemme get something to clean that up! 
     
     
     
    Applejack  Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but... I can take it from here. 
    Spike Don't be ridiculous! It is my honor and my duty! Today's just the beginning! 
    Applejack What's that now? 
    Spike You saved my life!  According to the "Spike the Dragon Code", I owe you a life debt and must serve you. 
    Granny Smith Now, what about Twilight? Doesn't she need your help and such? 
    Spike  Huh, you're right. I better break the news to Twilight. I just hope she doesn't take it too hard... Be right back! 
     

    Spike Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about! You have to do this! It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore... but it won't be the same... but it has to be done. Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves! 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm... 
    Spike And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days! I'm sure you understand. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm... 
    Spike It's... been an honor... being your faithful assistant. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds good. 
    Spike  

    Spike She said it was okay. 
    Applejack and Granny Smith Really? 
    Spike So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you untilâ€“ 
     
    Spike Well, until forever! 

    Applejack Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your "dragon code"... Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me. 
    Spike Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me! I have to be true to myself! If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore! 
    Applejack Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I? 
    Spike Great! Then from here on in, your wish is my command. 
     
    Applejack Oh, uh, okay... I would like you to... hmm... huh... oh! ...Help me take some of the pie you made to... 
    Spike Rarity? 
    Applejack Uh, sure, why not? 

    Spike I helped bake it. 
    Rarity Eugh. 
    Applejack  
    Rarity  
    Spike You even look good when you're chewing...  W-who looks good when they're chewing? 
    Rarity  
    Spike Aren't you gonna have some more? 
    Rarity I... had a big lunch! 
    Spike It's ten in the morning. 
    Rarity Breakfast. A big breakfast. 
    Spike Ohhh. Okay. 
    Applejack Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off? 
    Spike As you wish! 
    Rarity What was that all about? 
    Applejack  I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever. 
    Rarity  Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt! I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing andâ€“ 
    Applejack Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. You tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful. 
     
    Spike Do you... have a broom I could borrow? 
     
    Rainbow Dash AJ, Rarity, what's happening? 
    Rarity Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever. 
    Rainbow Dash Sweet! What are you having him do? Wash your laundry? Clean your room? Help you with your unfinished novel? Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts! 
    Rarity  How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line? 
    Rainbow Dash Just came to me. 
    Applejack Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop. 
    Rainbow Dash That's easy! Just make him help you with something really, really hard. 
    Applejack I dunno. I don't want him to get hurt. 
    Rainbow Dash Puh-lease. He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today. 
    Applejack You are? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I am. So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks! 
    Spike Rocks? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! A huge tower of rocks! And you're gonna build it! 
    Spike I am? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack... 
    Spike I do! It is Spike's dragon code! 
    Rainbow Dash Then get to it!  Trust me. This is gonna work like a charm! 

    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Huh. I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks. 
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness. If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do. 
    Applejack Why didn't I think of that? 
    Spike  Is this high enough? 
    Applejack That's plenty high! Come on down, Spike! 
    Rainbow Dash Bad news He actually ended up building the whole rock tower. Good news...  I've got a rock tower to knock down. 
    Spike Haha, yeah! You can do it! Haha, hahah, alright, yeah! 
     
    Spike That... was... awesome! 
     
    Spike Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash? Applejack can rebuild it for you. And when I say "Applejack", I of course mean me! 
    Rainbow Dash  Sure! Why not...? 
    Applejack No! I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help. My help. She doesn't need it. Right, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash Bbbbrrr. Yeah. I guess I'm good. For now. 
    Applejack And so am I! I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else. 
     
    Spike W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with? 
    Applejack Exactly that! There's nothin' else. I don't want you to do anything. 
    Spike If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon? 
    Applejack Well, Iâ€“ 
    Spike Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with! 
    Fluttershy If she needed help, I think she'd realize it. 
    Spike Maybe not! Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with. Like... maybe your back itches! 
    Applejack Huuuuh... that does feel... good... 
    Spike  See? Or you might need help remembering your favorite song! "The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure..." 
    Fluttershy I don't think that's her favorite sâ€“ 
    Spike Or... you might need help breathing! 
    Applejack Breathin'? I certainly do notâ€“ 
     
     
    Spike See? There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them! 
    Applejack No, I'll think of 'em. Lemme think of 'em. 
    Spike As you wish. 

    Applejack Twilight? Twilight, are you there? Twilight! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Agh! 
    Applejack Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway. What's going on? 
    Applejack I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, butâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait, what? 
    Applejack He said he told you all about it. I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, maybe a little... 
    Applejack I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily. Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about. Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon! 
    Applejack I sure am startin' to. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you. 

    Spike Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five... 
    Applejack All right, y'all, here's the deal. Spike needs to save my life. 
    Pinkie Pie And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets! I'll wear this mustache. 
    Applejack No. I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Can I still wear the mustache? 

    Applejack When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf. I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck. I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf! Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even. Everybody get it? 
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Uh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll do my best. 
    Rarity Mm-hmm. 
    Pinkie Pie Just one question. 
    Applejack Yes?  No. 
    Pinkie Pie  Suit yourself. 
     
    Rarity  We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack? 
    Applejack What d'you mean? 
    Rarity Show us your best "damsel in distress" move. 
    Applejack Uh... Oh, well, aheh, how's this? Hooooooo. 
    Rarity Absolutely horrendous! Okay, this needs some serious work! Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like soâ€“ 
    Spike  Applejack? 
    Applejack No time! Here he comes! Uh... over here, Spike! 
    Spike  You said you had something else you needed me to do? 
    Applejack Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, andâ€“ 
    Spike But of course. Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Applejack I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em... 
    Spike You asked me to. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Spike And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, Iâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy That was very convincing! 
    Rarity  We are doomed! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity  See? Like that. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  Oh no! I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks! I cannot run away! I am a damsel in distress! Help me, Spike! 
    Spike Wait a minute. 
    Applejack No, no, don't wait a minute. Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf! 
    Spike Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake! You got the clomping on his claws... 
     
    Spike ...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good. But you forgot one thing his breath! You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mileâ€“  Too late, I'm already onâ€“ 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash Timberwolf! 
     
     
    Spike Timberwolf! 
     
     
    Applejack Whooooah! 
     
    Applejack Ow! 
     
     
    Spike Uh oh... Applejack, come on! 
    Applejack  I can't! I'm really stuck! 
    Spike No more messing around! Let's go! 
    Applejack  Come on... 
     
    Applejack Forget it, Spike! You gotta get out of here! Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?! 
    Spike No! I have to save you! 
     
     
    Spike Let's get out of here!  
     
     

    Applejack and Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle What happened to you guys back there? Thought you were right behind us! 
    Applejack My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me! 
    Rarity Wait, you were actually stuck? 
    Spike Uh-huh! 
    Applejack But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life! 
    Spike Aw, it was nothing. 
    Applejack It was somethin' alright! 'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place. 
    Spike Yeah, what was that all about? 
    Applejack  I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say "that's what friends do" and leave it at that? I promise I won't think of you as any less noble. 
    Spike Sounds good to me. But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life? 
    Applejack You got yourself a deal. 

    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, Spike. 
    Spike Happy to help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't know what I'd do without you. 
    Spike No, really! I'm really really really happy to help you! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh... 

     
     

Keep Calm and Flutter On

    Pinkie Pie I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like? 
    Rarity I certainly do! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm surprised she's not here yet. 
    Spike  I wonder what's taking so long? 
    Twilight Sparkle And where are Applejack and Fluttershy? 
    Rarity Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along. 
    Spike But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late. 
    Twilight Sparkle She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it. 
    Rainbow Dash A visitor who's important and slow. 
    Rarity Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here. 
    Spike  Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, right. That's Discord. 
    Rarity Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that? 
    Spike M-m-maybe you should ask... her! 
    Rarity Huh? 

     

    Twilight Sparkle With all due respect, Princess Celestia, how could you bring Discord here?!  Your majesty. 
    Princess Celestia I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc. 
    Rainbow Dash If by "serious havoc" you mean "turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world"... 
    Rarity ...and tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves... 
    Pinkie Pie And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight! Not a single dollop! 
    Princess Celestia Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that. 
    Spike This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed! 
    Princess Celestia Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place? 
    Twilight Sparkle I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand. 
    Spike Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it! 
    Princess Celestia No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord. 
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy? Really? 

     
    Applejack What's he goin' on about now? 
    Fluttershy Good news. Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it. 
    Applejack Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle! 
     
    Fluttershy But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him "a nuisance". 
    Applejack Apologize? He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint! 
     
    Fluttershy  Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language! 
    Applejack Fine, fine. I apologize. 
     
    Applejack  
     
     
    Applejack  Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you. 
    Fluttershy Glad I could help. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you! 

    Princess Celestia I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will. 
    Fluttershy And... you really think I'll know best how to do that? 
    Princess Celestia I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works. 
    Spike Or... let's not. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice. 
    Rest of main cast Check! 
     
     
    Discord  
     
    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle What do you think you're doing?! 
    Discord Nnnnnnnnnghâ€“ Why, stretching, of course. When you're a creature of chaos, stone bodysuits aren't your typical go-to fashion choice. Nnngh...  
     
    Pinkie Pie  Make that bunny cute again! Now! 
    Discord Oh...  He's adorable the way he is. 
     
    Discord  You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks... 
    Twilight Sparkle How'd you know about that?! 
    Discord Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, unless you want us to turn you back to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto! 
    Discord Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess. 
    Rainbow Dash Try us, "Dip-cord"! 
    Fluttershy You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?! 
    Rainbow Dash You go, Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... the Stare! 
    Discord  
    Twilight Sparkle If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason! 
    Discord Mmm... I suppose that's correct.  
     
    Discord  
     
    Discord  
    Fluttershy Oh, dear. 

    Fluttershy He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable.  You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright? 
    Discord Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate... 
    Rainbow Dash Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does. 
    Discord Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that? 
    Rainbow Dash So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why! 
    Discord I never thought of that... 
    Rainbow Dash You big liar! 
    Discord Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all. 
     
    Discord Oops.  
    Applejack I can't watch... 
    Rainbow Dash We'll be outside. 
    Twilight Sparkle You sure you're okay with this? 
    Fluttershy I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do. 
    Twilight Sparkle You do? 
    Angel Bunny  
    Fluttershy I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that. 
    Twilight Sparkle And you really think that'll work? 
    Fluttershy I think it's worth a try. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper "help", and we'll be back here with our elements.  So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal! 
    Discord Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already. 
     
    Rarity She's really alright with him staying there? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's what she said. 
    Rainbow Dash Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole "befriending" business doesn't work out. 
    Rarity Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves. 
    Twilight Sparkle And I think I know just the trick. 

    Fluttershy Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do toâ€“ uh, umm, are you eating... paper? 
    Discord  
    Fluttershy Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone. 
    Discord Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye... 
     
    Discord You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool!  How d'ya like them carrots? 
    Angel  
    Discord  

     
    Twilight Sparkle That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull? 
    Spike Right here, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto. 
    Spike But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time? 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh. 
     
    Spike What's wrong? 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell protecting our books! Everywhere I thought I'd find the reforming spell...  

     
    Discord  Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds. 
    Fluttershy Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free. 
    Discord Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours. 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy  My friends aren't nasty! 
    Discord Well, of course you'd say that. It just goes to show how understanding you truly are. You know, I think Princess Celestia is right when she singled you out as the one who could reform me. You're off to such a good start, I'm seriously considering actually being reformed.  
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me? 
    Fluttershy Goodness! I hear Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?! 
    Fluttershy We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel? 
    Angel  
    Twilight Sparkle We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control! 
    Fluttershy Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike Seriously?! 
    Fluttershy I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself. 
    Spike Hate to break it to ya, but he used that "space to be himself" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library! 
    Fluttershy That does explain the paper eating... 
    Twilight Sparkle He ate them?! Ugggghhhh! 
    Fluttershy But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so. 
    Twilight Sparkle And you believed him? 
    Fluttershy If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Alright. Dinner it is. 

    Rainbow Dash Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord! 
    Rarity This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance. 
     
    Discord Oh, our pony guests!  We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in. 
    Fluttershy See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud. 
    Discord May I take your...  hats, ladies? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night. 

    Fluttershy As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil. 
     
    Fluttershy Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy? 
    Pinkie Pie You bet! 
    Discord Allow me. 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are! 
    Rainbow Dash That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me. 
    Fluttershy Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey! That's hot! 
    Discord Whoops!  I'm so sorry! 
    Rainbow Dash He did that on purpose! 
    Discord Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us fromâ€“ 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another "mistake"? 
    Discord No, I think you just made them mad. 
    Twilight Sparkle There's something fishy going on. 
     
    Fluttershy Discord? 
    Discord Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term "something fishy" to be offensive. 
    Rarity Not the dress! Not the dress! 
     
    Applejack That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do! 
    Fluttershy Now let's not jump to any conclusions. 
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him! 
     
    Discord Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it? 
    Rainbow Dash You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Rainbow Dash What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack? 
    Fluttershy Because that's what friends do. 
    Discord We're friends? 
    Fluttershy Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along. 
    Discord Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before. 
    Fluttershy Well, now you do! 
     
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Now is not a good time, Angel. We're having a dinner party. 
    Applejack Hold up! I-I think he's tryin' to tell us somethin'! 
     
     
    Main cast sans Fluttershy Apple! 
    Main cast sans Fluttershy and Applejack Applejack! 
     
     
    Rarity Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Apple Acres? 
    Rainbow Dash Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres! And we all know who's behind that now, don't we?! 
    Discord Who, me? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, give it a rest! What do you think of your "friend" now, Fluttershy? 

     
    Applejack I've never seen the floodin' this bad! They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this! What's goin' on? 
     
    Fluttershy  It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say! 
    Rainbow Dash You see Discord's behind all this, right? 
    Fluttershy Oh, of course I do! Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool? 

    Rarity 
    Only in the sense 
    of being silly and gullible... 

    

    Pinkie Pie 
    Um, well... 

    

    Applejack 
    Uh... uh, no, not exactly... 

    Fluttershy I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can, so he'd come to trust and listen to me! 
    Discord Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great! 
    Fluttershy Time to see if it worked. 
    Discord Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes. 
    Fluttershy As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Discord Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm. 
    Fluttershy It is awful. This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior. You need to fix this. 
    Discord Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return. 
    Fluttershy Yes? 
    Discord I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship. 
     
    Fluttershy I will never use my Element of Harmony against you. 
    Discord Excellent!  
     
    Fluttershy Discord! That's not fixing it! Why, I oughta... 
    Discord Where are you going? What's wrong, pal? 
    Fluttershy Don't call me your pal! 
    Discord Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones. 
    Spike Here you go, Fluttershy! Game on! 
    Twilight Sparkle He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand! 
     
    Fluttershy I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack and Rainbow Dash  
    Discord Hahah! You see? She wants to have fun with me because we're friends. She can't use the elements against me because we're friends. I'm free forever!  
    Fluttershy  Not. Your. Friend! 
    Discord Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had?  Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played. 
     
    Main cast sans Fluttershy  
    Discord I liked it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh? 

    Discord Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil.  Most of the time. 
    Princess Celestia Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord.  I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case. 
    Twilight Sparkle You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose. 
    Fluttershy Go on. Say it... 
    Discord  Friendship is magic. 
    Fluttershy See? He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him. 

     
     

Just for Sidekicks

    Spike  
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Me, that's who.  
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Who are you hooing at? 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike I know, they're delicious. 
     
    Spike Now you see 'em, now you don't.  I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't! Which means somebody took 'em! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Who? That's what I'm asking, who?! Who took my jewels?! Oh. I'm who. This cake was gonna be so good! Why?  Whyyyyyyyyy???!!! 
    Owlowiscious  

     

    Spike  I have no jewels... I have no cake... I'm a sad little dragon... With nothing toâ€“ 
     
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike ...is it? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything. 
    Spike Well... I do have this cake to not bake... 
    Fluttershy Oh... sorry, it's a bad time. 
    Spike Uh, inside joke. Talk to me. 
    Fluttershy It's just that... Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrowâ€“ 
    Spike Oh, I know all about that. As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming... 
    Fluttershy Oh, I don't know what was I thinking. Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and... here I am coming to ask you for a favor. You were probably going to say no anyway. All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel. 
    Spike What was that? 
    Fluttershy  All I have is this jewel. 
    Spike  That's a really big one. A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel. 
    Fluttershy Does this mean you'll do it? 
    Spike Yeah... Sure... 
    Fluttershy Oh, thank you, thank you! So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good. 
    Spike Wait, what? You want me to take care of him? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh, well, yes. But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else. 
    Spike Uhh... We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just... 
    Fluttershy Thank you, thank you, thank you! Angel, aren't you just so excited? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy See you tomorrow. 
    Angel  
    Spike You know... She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching... 

     
    Spike All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Tch! Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny. He can take care of himself. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Alright. You can watch him, but only because... uh... Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone. 
    Tank  
    Rarity Ohh!  
    Rainbow Dash You know... the two of us are very diligent. 
    Spike Okay, whatever. 
    Rarity Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe... 
     

    Rarity ...Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it. And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees. That's the only way she can get to sleep. 
    Opalescence  
     
     
    Rarity And, um... hmm... oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you. 
    Rainbow Dash A-hem... I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts. 
     
    Spike Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me... 
    Rainbow Dash Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency toâ€“ 
     
    Opalescence  
     
    Spike Critter-proofing. Yeah, I'll get right on that.  Three down, three to go. 

    Spike What's that you said, Gummy? Uh-huh. Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ask me, ask me! 
    Spike Go ahead, ask her! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Of course you can have another cupcake! Mm? Mm-hm? Yeah? Why didn't you say so? I'll get you a bigger pond immediately. 
    Spike I think what Gummy's trying to say isâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie He's always wanted a pair of riding pants? His toenails need a new coat of shellac? He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once?  
    Spike I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time. 
    Pinkie Pie Who wouldn't?! Spike time is the best! 
    Spike Alas, it doesn't come cheap. 

    Rainbow Dash All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet. You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle... once. 
     
    Spike A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness... 
     
    Spike  
    Applejack Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike. You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya? She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise. 
    Spike Exercise. Sure, of course. 
    Winona  
    Spike Whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list. 
    Applejack That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike. He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, really? 
     
    Fluttershy So sorry I'm late. Silly bunny had hidden his brush. Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it. 
    Applejack Come on, girls, or we're gonna miss the train. One more for the road? Oh, you little puppy-wuppy, come on here!  
    Pinkie Pie No, no no no. I love you more. No, I love you more! I love you more!!! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I promise it'll be okay. I'll fluff your tail twice next week. Three times? 
    Rarity Oh, I know. It's a chilly eighty one point two in here. Spike, take care of this, would you please? 
    Spike You got it! So, uhh... What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours? Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too. 
    Twilight Sparkle That would be nice. You sure you don't already have your hands full? 
    Spike Nah, pshaw. I'll be fine. But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the... paying customers. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You absolutely sure you can do this? 
    Spike Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters. 
    Spike  Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control. 
     
     
    Winona  
     

     
    Winona  
    Opalescence  
     
     
     
     
    Spike Alright, sidekicks, front and center! 
    Winona  
    Spike There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me... Gah! Two! And what I say goes! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Spike, the boss of you, that's who. One, two, three! Nngh, come on, number four! 
    Opalescence  
    Spike Whoa! Guh... 
    Gummy  
     
    Spike One, two, three, four, five... Argh, who's missing? 
     
    Spike Angel. 
     

     
    Spike All I wanted were some jewels. Big, juicy, delicious jewels. Now what do I have? A missing rabbit andâ€“ 
    Winona  
    Sweetie Belle Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for! 
    Spike  
    Angel  
    Sweetie Belle Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?! 
    Angel  
     
    Spike  Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead. 
    Apple Bloom We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today! 
    Scootaloo Major. We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Ha! Yeah! 
    Spike Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans... It's just, you're so good with them. Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good? 
    Apple Bloom A bunny-sittin' cutie mark... 
    Sweetie Belle That would be adorable! 
    Scootaloo He does seem to like us. 
    Apple Bloom And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing. 
    Spike You know what? As hard as it's gonna be for me part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them. If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark. Am I right or am I right? 
    Apple Bloom Sure! 
     
    Spike Yes! 
    Apple Bloom But wait! How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good? 
    Sweetie Belle And we'll need beds for when they're tired! 
    Scootaloo And toys! They need toys! 
    Spike It's an afternoon. They don't need all that stuff. They'll be fine. 
    Apple Bloom We need to be able to buy them some things! One jewel might be able to cover it all. 
    Spike Uh... what would I possibly be doing with jewels? 
    Apple Bloom I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means... 
    Spike Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon. Take it or leave it. 
    Apple Bloom We'll take it. 
     
     

    Spike  Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels! 
    Sweetie Belle  But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes! 
    Spike Meh... that bird could use a little color. 
    Scootaloo  Has anyone seen Tank's head? Where's his head?! 
     
    Spike What have you done to the turtle?! 
     
    Scootaloo Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that. Heh. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out. 
    Sweetie Belle And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either. 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike  Alright, load 'em up. And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you. 
    Apple Bloom Sorry, we don't have it anymore. 
    Spike What? Why not?! 
    Scootaloo How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer? 
     
    Spike  Oh. 

    Winona  
    Opalescence  
     
    Angel  
    Zecora Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you. 
    Spike I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next. 
    Zecora Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say. 
    Spike Really? 
    Zecora But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty. 
    Spike  Where are you going? 
    Zecora You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed. 
     
    Angel  
    Spike  
     

    Spike Almost there... 
    Granny Smith  Mm-hm... 
    Spike Just taking good care of everyone's animals. What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away?  And this is just between you and me, right? No other pony has to hear a word about it? 
     
    Granny Smith A word about what now? 
    Spike This better be important. 
     
    Conductor All aboard! 
    Spike Angel. 
    Conductor I can't have all of these animals on my train. Not without tickets and not without chaperones. 
    Spike All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off! Promise! 
    Conductor  Likely story. No chaperone, no train. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Scootaloo Skydiving cutie marks! 
     
    Spike Is three ponies enough?  At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures. 
    Conductor All aboard for the Crystal Empire! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Crystal Empire?! 
    Scootaloo I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire! 
    Sweetie Belle I wish I were dressed for it, but still...  THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE! 
    Spike We're not really going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're off! 
    Scootaloo What?! 
    Apple Bloom That's not fair! 
    Angel  
    Spike There he is! 
    Conductor Next stop, the Crystal Empire! 
    Spike No, no, no, no, no, no! 

     
    Apple Bloom So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not! It's as warm as can be! 
    Scootaloo Do you think the walls are crystal?  Maybe even see-through! Can you imagine see-through walls? 
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Opalesence  
    Spike Take it! Just take it! 

     
    Scootaloo So beautiful! 
    Spike Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville! 
    Apple Bloom There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around! 
    Spike Nopony's gonna get past this dragon! 
    Apple Bloom Don't make me use this! 
    Spike You wouldn't dare!  
     
    Spike Oh no!  
    Scootaloo Whoa, just whoa. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Sweetie Belle Ah! I'm in crystal heaven! 
    Spike Shhh! They're right there! There's the bunny! Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there! I'll fluff your tail! I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop! 
    Angel  
    Spike What do you want?! Name it, and it's yours!  Hyah! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Angel  
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh my goodness. 
    Conductor All aboard! 
    Spike Hah! You're coming with me! 
    Angel  

    Spike We made it! 
    Sweetie Belle Without seeing the palace! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think this car's empty. 
    Spike They're coming this way! Everybody down! 
    Sweetie Belle There has to be a better solution! 
    Spike Shh! Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down! 
    Applejack Whooeee! My dogs are barkin'. 
    Winona  
    Applejack Did y'all hear that? They really are! 
    Rainbow Dash Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home. 
    Applejack Think he's still got a handle on things? 
    Twilight Sparkle If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader. 
    Spike Go ahead, bunny. Do your worst. I deserve it. I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to. I wasn't really thinking about you at all. Any of you. Just wanted the jewels. I hope you'll all forgive me someday. 
    Winona  
    Spike You will?  Oh great. I'm gonna be the one who gives us away. 
     
    Spike Where did youâ€“  
    Applejack You all hear that? 
     

     
    Applejack I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona. Oh, I miss her. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't wait to see Owlowiscious!  
    Spike Hello! Thought we'd meet you at the station! 
    Sweetie Belle So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station! 
    Rarity How did you know about the snow globes? 
    Sweetie Belle Um... lucky guess? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've gotta hand it to you, Spike. You did a really good job of taking care of the animals. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect! You did such a good job fluffing his tail. 
    Spike Yeah, well... we're like this now. 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike You know who. 

    Owlowiscious  
    Twilight Sparkle So what are you thinking? Bake 'em into a jewel pie? Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good! 
    Spike Yeah, it does.  Whyyyyyyyyy???!!! 
    Winona  

     
     

Games Ponies Play

     
    Twilight Sparkle You absolutely sure you can do this? 
    Spike Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters. 
    Spike  Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Hurry up, Twilight! We can't miss our train! 
    Conductor Tickets. 
    Applejack Oh, this is gonna be a real treat. Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited. 
    Rainbow Dash Duh! Of course they're excited. They're up for the Equestria Games. It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria. 
    Rarity Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year? 
    Rainbow Dash No. Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year. I'll never forget when we got the bad news. 

    Laurette The Equestria Games go to... the city of Fillydelphia. 
    Young Rainbow Dash NOOOOOOOOOOO! 

    Rainbow Dash These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. They've had enough bad news. No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. Princess Cadance is counting on us to do our part to convince the Games Inspector to choose the Crystal Empire. And we are not gonna let her down. Are we? 
    Pinkie Pie NOOOOOOOOOOO! What? I was just answering Twilight's question. 

     

     
    Main cast Four, three, two, one! The Crystal Empire, that's the one! 
    Pinkie Pie  Okay, everypony, great job! Sounds like we're ready. 
    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle One more time from the top. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Rarity Oh, please! I think that was perfect. 
    Applejack  But we've run this, like, twelve times already. I think we've got it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Cadance said the Games Inspector really puts folks through the wringer on her visits. There's no margin for error here. And this time we need to practice the steps. 
    Applejack On a train car? 
    Rainbow Dash You heard the pony! On your hooves! 
    Main Cast Two, four, six, eightâ€“  
     
     
    Train Conductor Crystal Empire, ladies! Watch your step leaving the train! 
    Rarity  
    Applejack  Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wow! The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever! 
    Applejack They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up! 
    Twilight Sparkle This must be why we were asked to handle the welcome committee routine. 
    Rainbow Dash And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it. 
    Applejack Princess Cadance was right. These ponies do look pretty darn excited. 
    Rainbow Dash Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out. That right there. That is the face I do not want to see. 
    Rest of main cast  

     
    Twilight Sparkle We're here. 
    Princess Cadance  There are my girls. 
    Twilight and Cadance Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! 
    Rarity  
    Twilight and Cadance Clap your hooves and do a little shake!  
    Rarity Oh, my. This is spectacular. Please, everypony, stand back! I need air! 
    Princess Cadance Go ahead and try whatever you like. It's all complimentary for the welcome committee. 
    Rarity Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
    Princess Cadance That over there is a crystal mud bath, which relaxes your body and rejuvenates your coat. Now, I realize it can be kind of strange to climb into mud, but if you'll just give it a chance, I'm sureâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, no! 
    Pinkie Pie  Ahh, so relaxing! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie! Honestly! 
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance Go ahead, have a good time while I get my ceremonial headdress done. 
    Rarity Ceremonial... headdress? 
    Princess Cadance When meeting with important guests, it was tradition for rulers of the Crystal Empire to weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way. The Games Inspector is known for doing her homework. She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit. 
     
    Mercury Princess, if I may have a word... I-I have two pieces of news for you. First, your mane stylist has the flu and won't be able to make it for fear of you catching it, too. 
    Princess Cadance Oh. Well... I hope she's better soon. Do any of the other stylists here know how to do the traditional royal ceremonial headdress? 
    Crystal Ponies Um... well... uh... (No.) 
    Princess Cadance Oh.  Just a... small detail. 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're trying to land the Equestria Games here. There is no such thing as a small detail! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! 
    Rarity I suppose... I could give it a shot. 
    Princess Cadance Oh, Rarity, you would do that for me? 
    Rainbow Dash Way to step it up, Rare! 
    Princess Cadance Fortunately, I have all the precise instructions right here. 
     
    Rarity Oh, my! 
    Princess Cadance You sure you're up to this? 
    Rarity Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime! I will give it everything I've got! 
    Twilight Sparkle See? No worries! 
    Rarity Besides, the Games Inspector isn't expected for several hours. I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to... do... this... 
    Princess Cadance Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful!  You said you had a second bit of news? 
    Mercury Yes, quite. The Games Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny, will be arriving on the... next train. 
    All  
    Rainbow Dash What!? You couldn't have told her that news first!? That's fifteen minutes from now! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle  How long before Cadance is ready? 
    Rarity Hmmmm... I'm sure to find some shortcuts. 
    Twilight Sparkle Can you have her back at the castle when we're done? 
    Rarity Done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, we'll be fine. Everypony, just be on the look out for the pony with the flower print luggage. 
    Pinkie Pie Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy! 
    Twilight Sparkle We bring the Games Inspector back to the castle, put on our big welcome committee how-do-you-do and then... 
    Pinkie Pie Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth? 
    Rainbow Dash I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you mean? 
    Rainbow Dash You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games. 
    Fluttershy Oh, no... We're gonna blow it... 
    Rainbow Dash Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Excuse me, ma'am? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Yes, what is it? 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle Be cool.  Well, I know you're not expecting us, but we're here to personally welcome you to the Crystal Empire. 
    Ms. Peachbottom The whole lot of you came to do that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, well, um... yes! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Well, darn tootin', ain't that the cat's meow! Y'all didn't need to do that. Why, I hardly expected anything like this. 
    Applejack Whew! The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way. 
    Ms. Peachbottom The Princess? Princess Cadance? 
    Twilight Sparkle None other! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Well, tie me up and throw me down! This just keeps gettin' better and better! 
    Fluttershy Can we help you with your bags? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Don't mind if ya do! 
    Fluttershy Ooh, I love flower print! Sorry. 
    Pinkie Pie Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you! 
    Ms. Peachbottom The castle? Are you kidding?! Hot-diggety-dawg! 
    Twilight Sparkle See that? We just gotta roll with it until the Princess gets there and we'll be just fine. 
     

     
     
    Princess Cadance So, uh... how's it going so far? 
    Rarity Oh, I'm so sorry... It's just... oh so complicated.  I can fix it! 
    Princess Cadance Fix what?! 
    Rarity Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional! But it's not! 

    Ms. Peachbottom My golly, the crystal castle!  From the inside... 
    Fluttershy Oh, my gosh, she's so nice! 
    Rainbow Dash You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game. 
     
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, my, I'm so excited. 
    Twilight Sparkle Please, have a seat, won't you? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Mind if I take a quick run outside first? It was an awfully long train ride and my legs could use a stretch. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, well... we were just about to start. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh! Never you mind. You go on ahead. I'm listening. 
    Rainbow Dash She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bumpâ€“ 
    Fluttershy â€“cha! 
    Twilight Sparkle We'd like to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to this wonderful kingdom! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, why, the pleasure is all mine. 
    Twilight Sparkle And since we're not even from here ourselves, who better than us to let you know just how welcoming this place can be! 
    Main cast

        Two, four, six, eight! 
        Name a place that's really great! 
        One, two, three, four! 
        Keeps you coming back for more! 
        Two, seven, nine, three! 
        The place that we all wanna be! 
        Four, three, two, one! 
        The Crystal Empire, that's the one! 

    Ms. Peachbottom Oooh, yeah!  
    Main cast  
    Ms. Peachbottom Ooh, I tell ya! I have traveled far and wide, but I have never, ever been welcomed anyplace in the fashion that y'all have done here today. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's fantastic! Princess Cadance would be so glad to hear that! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Honestly, I'm surprised she knows anything about me at all! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Of course she does! She's been looking forward to your visit for weeks! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, goody! Is she here? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... 
    Applejack  Where the heck is she anyway? Wasn't she supposed to be here by now? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, that's all right.  
    Rainbow Dash Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle! That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time! 
    Ms. Peachbottom Ooh, a tour of the crystal castle... I'd love that a whole heap. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Dash! We've hardly ever even been here before! 
    Rainbow Dash  It's just another test! We gotta roll with it, remember? 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh! Lemme give the tour! I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Fine. You all start giving her the tour, and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance. 
     
    Ms. Harshwhinny Oof! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello there! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Hello yourself. First hello of the dayâ€“ 
     
    Ms. Harshwhinny Oof!  

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity  W-What are you doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle We finished the welcome committee song and we just wanted to introduce Ms. Harshwhinny toâ€“ 
    Rarity No, no! Princess Cadance isn't ready. Something's gone terribly wrong! 
    Twilight Sparkle I need to speak to the Princess. 
    Rarity You can't! You mustn't! She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair! 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, how bad can it be? 
    Rarity Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ew. 
    Rarity Please! I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time! There's no other way! 
     

    Pinkie Pie So, you see this here? This, um, this is, um... a big, round room. It's known for its roundness and bigness. And did I mention that it's round? 
    Ms. Peachbottom I think they call it a rotunda? A small, confining, rotunda... 
    Pinkie Pie  Whatever. Round is round, am I right? 
    Applejack  Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that. 
    Ms. Peachbottom You know... I love this sort of architecture. I-I-I detect a neo-Gothic inspiration in the design, yes? 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! Look at me!  
    Applejack  And not a moment too soon. Where's Cadance? Please tell me she's right behind you. 
    Twilight Sparkle There's a bit of a problem with her headdress. How's it going here? 
    Pinkie Pie Boingy, boingy, boingy!  
    Ms. Peachbottom I, uh, hate to be a bother, but the legs are cramping up on me with all this standing around... 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle She's getting bored, and we have to buy Rarity some more time.  I'll see if Shining Armor can come help. Can't one of you other ponies take over in the meantime? 
    Rainbow Dash I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking... 

    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Athletes  
    Shining Armor Twily! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello there! Shining Armor, you've gotta help me. 
    Shining Armor  Everything okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle I left the other ponies behind giving the Games Inspector the worst castle tour ever. 
    Shining Armor Come on, gang! Are we gonna gallop, or are we gonna trot!?  Everything's gonna be okay. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, I'm not worried. I'm not worried... it worked! 
    Ms. Peachbottom  Feels so good to stretch the old legs! 
    Shining Armor Uh, what theâ€“ 
    Rainbow Dash Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium. 
    Shining Armor Watch it! 
     
    Ms. Peachbottom Woo-hoo! 
    Shining Armor Make her stop! 
    Rainbow Dash Wait, that's the Games Inspector! Let her do her thing. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Good. Oh, these hooves! I'm outside! 
    Shining Armor Why would she do that? 
    Rainbow Dash I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not. 
     
     
    Ms. Peachbottom  Oh! Oh, get me outside for a run! 
    Shining Armor Look out! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, okay, we need to stop her. 

    Ms. Peachbottom  
     
    Fluttershy Where's she going in such a hurry? 
    Ms. Peachbottom  
    Rainbow Dash Closer... closer... I think we've got her... Yaaaaaaah! 
     
     
    Ms. Peachbottom Hoo-eee! Oh, that felt good! Nothing like a great run to shake the cobwebs off these old bones. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Ms. Peachbottom Hey there, speedy. Ah, these wide open spaces y'all got here remind me of home. This is great! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh!  
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, good golly, yes. I just love to travel and see new places. Such a beautiful spot you got here, too! 
    Shining Armor Why... thank you so much! I'm Shining Armor. 
    Ms. Peachbottom  The Prince! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on? 
    Rainbow Dash From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all. Ain't no thing. 
    Ms. Peachbottom My, oh, my... I never met a Prince before... 
    Shining Armor  I'm surprised. I'd think in your line of work you'd meet princes all the time. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Hardly. Just an ordinary wild mustang from Mustangia here to enjoy a little vay-cay. Never thought I'd also be meeting royalty to boot.  
    Twilight Sparkle You... are Ms. Harshwhinny, the Equestria Games Inspector, aren't you? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Inspector what-now? 
    Rainbow Dash We got the wrong pony?! 
    Pinkie Pie NOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Applejack Oh, please still be here... Oh please, oh please, oh please... 
    Twilight Sparkle There's got to be another pony with flower print luggage around here somewhere. 
    Rainbow Dash Except that there isn't! 
    Twilight Sparkle We've gotta find her before Cadance finds out what a mess we've made of things. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, here's what we do. We split the Empire up into five sectors. 
    Fluttershy Each of us search a sector. 
    Pinkie Pie Well... except for the spa. What's the point of checking there? That's where Cadance is. If Ms. Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right? 
    Rest of main cast  

    Ms. Harshwhinny Every city and empire wants to host the Equestria Games. So, I have to go through all the big phony-baloney song and dance, though of course, I'm never getting the real inside scoop. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oh, golly, I've been having a swell time since I got here. I'm actually thinking of extendin' my stay. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny And what exactly has made your visit so special? 
    Ms. Peachbottom Oohohohoooh, gosh, where to start? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, there she is! We're in luck! I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here! 
     
    Rarity Wonderful news, look! Princess Cadance, better than new! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Princess Cadance? So, this is where you've been! I will have you know this is by far the worst welcome I've had in all my years! 
    Princess Cadance I-I can't believe it... What was wrong with your welcome? 
    Ms. Harshwhinny There wasn't one! 
    Princess Cadance What is going on? 
    Rainbow Dash Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Not so fast, speedy. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny I just finished hearing about how this pony was just treated to the warmest, finest, most fabulous reception she ever had. 
    Ms. Peachbottom Darn tootin'! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Courtesy of these fine ponies right here. Which, in my expert opinion, amounts to the first ever unvarnished, unrehearsed, and unbiased appraisal of a potential host of the Equestria Games. Which can only mean one thing... 

    Princess Cadance  The next host of the Equestria Games is... the Crystal Empire! 
     
    Rainbow Dash We did it! 
    Princess Cadance  Congratulations, Crystal Ponies! 
     

    Rainbow Dash  You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had. Almost as good as getting it yourself. Almost. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll still be able to come back here and watch the games when they're played. 
    Rainbow Dash You're right. That'll rock! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness. 
    Conductor All aboard! 
    Rainbow Dash Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home. 
    Applejack Think he's still got a handle on things? 
    Twilight Sparkle  If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader. 
    Spike  
    Applejack You all hear that? 

     
     

Magical Mystery Cure

    

        Morning in Ponyville shimmers 
        Morning in Ponyville shines 
        And I know for absolute certain 
        That everything is certainly fine 

        There's the Mayor en route to her office 
        There's the sofa clerk selling some quills 

    Davenport Morning, kid! 

    

        My Ponyville is so gentle and still 
        Can things ever go wrong? 
        I don't think that they will 

        Morning in Ponyville shimmers 
        Morning in Ponyville shines 
        And I know for absolute certain 
        That everything is certainlyâ€” 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, that's not funny! 
    Rarity Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Something tells me everything is not going to be fine. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing? What happened to your cutie mark? 
    Rarity Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what? 
    Ponies  
    Rarity Too last season? 
    Twilight Sparkle Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this? 

    Spike  I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not about the weather, Spike. Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage. Something strange is going on...  
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, guys. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And what in Equestria is going on in... here? 

    

        These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit 
        They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits 
         
        It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see 
        It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me 

    

         
        I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face 
        But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace 
         
         
        I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see 
        It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me 

    

        I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot 
        No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute! 
        I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me 
        But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me 

    

        Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress 
        I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress 
        Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess? 
        My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me 

    

        I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns 
        For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns 
        I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see 

    

        It's got to be 

    

        It's got to be 

    

        My destiny 

    

        My destiny 

    

        And it's what my cutie mark 

    

        It's what my cutie mark 

    

        Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me! 

    Twilight Sparkle This is bad. This is very, very bad. 
    Spike What's going on? Why is this happening?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess. 

    Twilight Sparkle Dear Twilight Sparkle, 
    The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece.  Ooh! He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia 
    From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme! 

    Twilight Sparkle I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong! 
    Spike So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. There is no counter-spell! 
    Spike Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered! 
    Spike Zecora's cure for the cutie pox? 
    Twilight Sparkle That won't work either... 
    Spike Well , maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault. 

    

        I have to find a way 
        To make this all okay 
        I can't believe this small mistake 
        Could've caused so much heartache 

        Oh why, oh why? 

        Losing promise 
        I don't know what to do 
        Seeking answers 
        I fear I won't get through to you 

        Oh why, oh why? 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike, what have I done? 

    Spike Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends... 
    Spike Twilight? Are you alright? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got it! I know what to do! 
    Spike You do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, wait! 
    Fluttershy Oh... Hey, Twilight... 
    Twilight Sparkle Where are you going? 
    Fluttershy I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals. 
    Fluttershy But... I don't really know anything about animals... 
    Twilight Sparkle But you do know something about Rainbow Dash. 
    Fluttershy I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her. 

     
    Rainbow Dash  Whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped! 
    Fluttershy Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you! 
    Fluttershy Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack? 
     
     
    Fluttershy Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends. 
    Bear  
    Fluttershy Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I... I feel strange, like... like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am! My destiny! Wha... what happened? 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, look! Your cutie mark! 

    Twilight Sparkle It worked! It worked! Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal! Now we need your help!

    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help! 
    Rarity Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we? 

    

        Pinkie Pie is in trouble 
        We need to get there by her side 
        We can try to do what we can now

    Applejack Yee-haw! Now that's more like it! What's next? 
    Twilight Sparkle The townspeople are furious. We need the old Pinkie Pie back. 
    Applejack I'm on it. I know just the thing. 

    

        The townspeople need you 
        They've been sad for a while 
        They march around, face a-frown 
        And never seem to smile 
        And if you feel like helpin' 
        We'd appreciate a lot 
        If you'd get up there and spread some cheer

    From all of us together, together we're friends. With the marks of our destinies made one, there is magic without end! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Fluttershy  What happened? 
    Rest of main cast  

    Twilight Sparkle  Hello? Where am I? What is this place? 
    Princess Celestia  Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Princess... I don't understand. What did I do? 
    Princess Celestia You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ready? Ready for what? 

    

        You've come such a long, long way 
        And I've watched you from that very first day 
        To see how you might grow 
        To see what you might do 
        To see what you've been through 
        And all the ways you've made me proud of you 

        It's time now for a new change to come 
        You've grown up and your new life has begun 
        To go where you will go 
        To see what you will see 
        To find what you will be 
        For it's time for you to fulfill your destiny 

    Applejack Twilight? Is that you? 
    Rest of main cast  
    Applejack Wha... I-I've never seen anything like it! 
    Rainbow Dash Ha! Twilight's got wings! Awesome! A new flying buddy!  
    Rarity Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible. 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Fluttershy Wow... You look just like a princess! 
    Princess Celestia That's because she is a princess. 
    Main cast Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie Hold on a second!  
    Twilight Sparkle A... A princess? 
    Princess Celestia Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore? 
    Princess Celestia Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read? 
    Princess Celestia  There will be time for all of that later. 

    Princess Celestia We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle! 

    

        The Princess Twilight cometh 
        Behold, behold 
        A Princess here before us 
        Behold, behold, behold 

        Behold, behold (behold, behold) 
        The Princess Twilight cometh 
        Behold, behold (behold, behold) 
        The Princess is 
        The Princess is here! 

     
    Princess Celestia Say something, Princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Um...  A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony! 
     
    Shining Armor Twilight! I'm so proud of you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you crying? 
    Shining Armor Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing. 
    Shining Armor and Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack Way to go, Princess! 
    Pinkie Pie Best coronation day ever! 
    Fluttershy We love you, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I love you too, girls! 

    

        Life in Equestria shimmers 
        Life in Equestria shines 
        And I know for absolute certain 

    

        That everything (that everything) 
        Yes, everything (yes, everything) 
        Yes, everything is certainly fine 
        Itâ€™s fine 

    Twilight Sparkle Yes! Everythingâ€™s going to be just fine! 

     

Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1

    Rainbow Dash You gotta really flap 'em hard. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, maybe not quite that hard. 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! Oof! 
    Applejack Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that. 
    Rarity Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title. 
    Twilight Sparkle If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right.  And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm never gonna be ready to perform my part. 
    Rainbow Dash Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish! 
    Main 6 sans Twilight  
    Twilight Sparkle Woo-hoo! Whaaaa! Oof! Oof!  
    Pinkie Pie Wow! That was a big finish! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Rarity You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality. 
    Twilight Sparkle I suppose. 
    Rarity Oh, don't be so modest. It's everypony's dream to someday wear a crown and have their coronation ceremony preserved in stained glass for all to see.  
    Rainbow Dash I don't know if it's everypony's dream. 
    Pinkie Pie Most of my dreams are about frosting!  Ohohohoho... 
    Fluttershy We'd better get going. We don't want to miss our train. 
    Applejack Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun. 
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends. 
    Rarity It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first. 
    Applejack The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected. Exhibit A The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony. No amount of royal duties is gonna change that. Right, everypony? 
    Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Applejack Right, Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Creamy, creamy frosting...  
    Fluttershy You should take that as a yes. 

     
    Pinkie Pie We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us! Right, girls? 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Rarity Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye. 
    Rarity And you will be with us right after the Celebration. We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor. 
     
    Train Conductor All aboard for Ponyville! 
    Main 6 sans Twilight  
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  I can't help it, Spike. They've only been gone a minute, and I already feel like I'm missing something. 
    Messenger Pony For the Princess. 
    Spike  Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything. Your friend, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie  That's me! 
    Main 6 sans Twilight  
    Twilight Sparkle But I am. I just know it. 

    Spike Check, check, check, check, and... check! Huh, whaddaya know? We're way ahead of schedule! I credit your extremely competent assistant. 
    Twilight Sparkle So do I. 
    Spike The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event! 
    Twilight Sparkle  That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?! 
     
    Spike Uh... so that's a 'no' then? 
    Twilight Sparkle These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down! 
    Princess Celestia And I'm sure you won't. 
    Spike Your highness! 
    Princess Celestia No need for that now, Princess Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry. 
    Princess Celestia  No need to apologize. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry! 
    Princess Celestia I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you mean? 
    Princess Celestia For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me...  It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister. 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess I never really thought about it that way. 
    Princess Celestia But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe a little. 
    Princess Celestia You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you. 
    Spike  I think this guy needs you? 
    Messenger Pony Uh, a message for Princess Twilight. 
     
    Princess Celestia A letter from Ponyville, I presume? 
    Twilight Sparkle Never mind. It's not important. Spike, where were we? 
    Spike About to call it a night? 
    Twilight Sparkle We should probably go over the checklist one more time. 
    Spike I knew you were gonna say that... 
    Princess Celestia I'll leave you to it. 

    Princess Celestia  

    Twilight Sparkle Huh?! Spike? 
    Spike  Check-check-check-check-check-check... 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
    Spike Ungh... What time is it? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's the middle of the night! But it could be morning. That's just it! I can't tell! 
    Spike Whoa. That is weird. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Spike, we have to find out what's going on. 

     
    "Primrose" What do you think it means?! 
    Royal Ribbon Princess Twilight will know! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I'm-I'm sure it's just... Well, there's certainly a logical exâ€“ 
    Royal guard #1 Your Highness, you must come with us. 
     
    Royal guard #1 It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. 
    Royal guard #2 They're gone! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  

    Twilight Sparkle But I don't understand! Where are they? 
    Royal guard #1 We don't know. It seems that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna have simply... vanished. 
    Spike Vanished?! 
     
    Royal guard #1 This is why we have come to you. 
    Royal guard #2 We await your command. 
    Twilight Sparkle My command?! 
    Royal guard #2 We're officers of the Royal Guard. We take our orders from royalty. With Princess Luna and Princess Celestia gone, and Princess Cadance overseeing the Crystal Empire now, that means we take our orders from you. 
     
    Royal guard #2 Princess Twilight, there's no time to waste. We need to know what you want us to do. 
    Twilight Sparkle I want you to continue the search for Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. We have to find them before ponies start to panic. There must be some clue that can tell us what's happened to them. If you find something, anything, let me know immediately.  
    Spike Way to take charge, Twilight. 
     
    Royal guard #3 Your highness! News from Ponyville! The Everfree Forest appears to be... well... invading! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     

     
    Fluttershy Excuse me... Oh, pardon me... Are you all right? My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress? 
    Bear  
    Fluttershy Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about.  Oh, no, you were right. You should be worried! Very, very worried! 

    Granny Smith  
     
    Applejack Come on, y'all! Put your backs into it!  
     
    Big McIntosh Eeyup.  
     
    Big McIntosh ...Nope. 
    Applejack  Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before. Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all! Have y'all? 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Applejack Where the heck are these things comin' from? And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?! 

    Rainbow Dash Oh, no, you don't! This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration. You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong! Whoa!  Hey! 

    Rarity  Hmm. Something strange about the sky. 
     
     
    Rarity What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?! 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry! I promise I am not doing this on purpose! 
     
     
    Rarity It wasn't me, I swear! 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Ooh, Sweetie Belle! If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it! 
    Sweetie Belle Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn! 
     
    Sweetie Belle  
    Rarity  
    Sweetie Belle  
    Rarity  

    Spike Where are we going?! 
    Twilight Sparkle The Everfree Forest is... 'invading'. Whatever is going on, I'm sure we're going to need our friends and the Elements of Harmony to stop it! I just hope we haven't missed the train... 
    Spike  Twilight? There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember? 
    Twilight Sparkle There is? 
    Spike Huah! You can fly! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Right! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! 

     
    Rarity Something very strange is going on, and-  I for one would appreciate an explanation! 
    Rainbow Dash All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here. 
    Applejack Neither are all these crazy plants! They're comin' from the Everfree Forest! And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em! Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'? 
    Rarity Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz! 
    Fluttershy We have to figure out something! I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take!  I don't know how much more I can take! 
    Applejack The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville... I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  
     
    Spike I'm starting to wish... we'd taken the train! 
    Twilight Sparkle Almost there! Come on, Spike, we need to get the Elements of Harmony and find the others! 
    Spike Incoming! 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! Aah! 
     
    Rarity Oh, thank goodness! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission... 
     
    Spike Sweet ground!  Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, I get it! I need to work on my flying! 
    Pinkie Pie I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control. 
    Rarity  
    Applejack Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all. 
    Rarity But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity. Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste? 
    Twilight Sparkle Not exactly. You see, Princess Celestia is, well... she and Princess Luna are both... 
    Spike Gone missing! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know who has taken them, but I've got a hunch we're going to need the Elements of Harmony to get them back. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah, just like old times. 
    Pinkie Pie A-boo-yah! 
    Applejack I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements.  Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food! Any ideas? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... 
    Pinkie Pie I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through! Oopsies! Missed a spot! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Half day, half night... strange weather patterns... out of control plants. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against. 

     
    Discord  Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower. 
    Twilight Sparkle E-nough! Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading! 
    Discord Why,  whatever are you talking about? 
    Applejack Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this! 
    Discord Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it! 
    Discord I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends. 
    Pinkie Pie Drop the act, buster! We're onto you! 
    Discord Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you? 
    Main cast sans Fluttershy Yes! 
    Fluttershy Um, maybe? 
    Discord Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it. 
    Rainbow Dash I say we blast him back to stone! 
    Applejack Works for me! 
    Rarity Hear, hear! 
    Fluttershy Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth? 
    Discord Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here. 
    Fluttershy Um, it's Fluttershy. 
    Discord Oh, right, whatever. 
    Twilight Sparkle If you're not the one responsible, then help us figure out who is! 
    Discord I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rrrgh! 
    Discord Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything? 
    Twilight Sparkle Zecora! 
    Zecora From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me! 
    Applejack Any idea why all this is happenin'? 
    Zecora I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white. After a sip, you may see why the sky is day and night. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie Oooh! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Doesn't seem to be worki- 

    Twilight Sparkle Where am I? 
    Princess Luna Not... another step! 
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Luna! I don't understand. Where are we? Why did you and Celestia disappear? 
    Princess Luna Did you really expect me to sit idly by while they all basked in your precious light? 
    Twilight Sparkle Precious light? 
    Princess Luna There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess... will be me! 
     
    Nightmare Moon  
     

     

Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2

     

    Royal Guard It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. 

    Spike They're missing! 

    Twilight Sparkle The Everfree Forest is... invading. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against. 

    Discord I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend? 

    Zecora You can turn the potion from purple to white. You may see why the sky is day and night. 

    Twilight Sparkle Princess Luna! 
    Princess Luna There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess will be me! 
    Nightmare Moon  

     

    Nightmare Moon  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Luna! Think of how long you were banished to the moon! You'll give us no choice but to send you back there if you don't stop! 
    Princess Celestia Luna, I will not fight you! You must lower the moon! It is your duty! 
    Nightmare Moon Luna? I am... Nightmare Moon! I have but one royal duty now to destroy you! And where do you think you're going? 
    Princess Celestia  
    Twilight Sparkle Celestia! 
    Nightmare Moon  
    Twilight Sparkle No... Why would Luna do this? Why now?  You're all right. You're all right! Princess Celestia? 
    Princess Celestia Oh, dear sister. I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her. 
    Nightmare Moon Nooooooo! 

    Twilight Sparkle Why are you all looking at me like that? 
    Applejack It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself... 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing! 
    Fluttershy We were really worried about you. 
    Discord I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road. 
    Rainbow Dash Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them? 
    Twilight Sparkle I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now. 
    Zecora Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek. Another sip of the potion will give you a peek. 
    Spike You sure about this? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Discord Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time! 

    Discord Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'? 
    Princess Celestia  Play time is over for you, Discord. 
    Discord Oh, I doubt that.  Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there? 
    Princess Celestia The Elements of Harmony. 
    Princess Luna With them, we shall defeat you. 
    Twilight Sparkle This must be when they turned Discord into stone. 
    Discord  Hilarious! 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Luna  The Tree of Harmony. 
    Twilight Sparkle The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark. 
    Princess Luna Are you sure? 
    Princess Celestia We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here. 

    Spike So what did you find out? 
    Twilight Sparkle I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony. 
    Rainbow Dash The tree of what now? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger. 
    Applejack Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think it's in... there. 
    Discord Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn! 

    Rarity Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony. 
    Twilight Sparkle Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together. 
    All  

    Twilight Sparkle We can use those to cross.  
    Rarity  A cragadile! Run for your lives! 
    Cragadile  
    Main 6 sans Twilight  
    Twilight Sparkle That was close. 
    Applejack  A little too close, if you ask me. You sure you're all right? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it. 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, you'll figure it out eventually. 
    Twilight Sparkle "Eventually" isn't soon enough. 
    Applejack You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? Why? 
    Applejack For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly. 
    Twilight Sparkle We all did. He wasn't after just me. 
    Applejack Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's that got to do with anything? 
    Applejack Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess. 
    Rarity Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence. 
    Twilight Sparkle But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like. 
    Rainbow Dash Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it. 
    Twilight Sparkle All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here? 
    Fluttershy It is probably for the best. 

    Discord  
    Cherry Berry and Comet Tail Help! Help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Discord! 
    Discord You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree? 
    Twilight Sparkle We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return. 
    Discord I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think I'm better than anypony! 
    Discord Oh, well, how silly of me to assume that you would think that. All you did was choose to keep your precious princess self out of harm's way while your friends thrust themselves right into it. I'm sure you'll all be the best of pals again when they return from their terrifying yet deeply bonding experience that they're having without you.  
    Twilight Sparkle I never should have agreed to come back here. 
    Spike Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, it's working! 

    Rainbow Dash Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybeâ€“ 
    Applejack Maybe it's right down there. 
    Rainbow Dash  It can't be! 
    Rarity How are we supposed to get to it? 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Take the stairs, silly! 

    Spike Are we there yet? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know where we are. We're lost. I never should have left my friends. 
    Spike We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  

    Fluttershy  I think it's dying! 
    Applejack So let's save it already!  
    Rainbow Dash Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof! 
    Rarity Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy. 
    Applejack And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought. 
    Fluttershy I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home. 

    Rainbow Dash It was your idea, Applejack! 
    Applejack We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her. 
    Spike Oof! Ow! Ugh! 
     
    Spike Twilight! Trouble! Help! 

    Plant Crab  
    Applejack Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Plant Crab  
    Rainbow Dash Up here! 
    Pinkie Pie Yoo-hoo! Come and get me! 
    Rarity Don't forget about me! 
    Pinkie Pie Ta-da! 
    Plant Crab  
    Applejack I sure am glad you came looking for us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not as glad as I am that you found me. 
    Rarity The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. Equestria may need its princess... 
    Fluttershy ... But we need our friend. 

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Celestia  Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony. 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria? 
    Rarity How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone? 
    Applejack Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready? 
    All except Twilight Ready!  
     
    Discord  Oh, poo. 
    Princess Celestia We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it? 
    Princess Luna Six locks, six keys. 
    Princess Celestia I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone. 

     
    Discord Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison? 
    Applejack  Gone. 
    Discord Gone? Gone? 
    Fluttershy But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up. 
    Discord Fine. But I don't do windows. 
    Applejack One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now? 
    Discord I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago. 
    Twilight Sparkle What did you say?! 
    Discord Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself? 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Princess Celestia Play time is over for you, Discord! 
    Discord Oh, I doubt that.  Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is. 

    Twilight Sparkle You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?! 
    Discord And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am? 
     

     
    Princess Celestia Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna. 
     

     
     

Castle Mane-ia

    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Spike What's wrong, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, I've gone through every book in Ponyville, Spike, and there isn't a single mention of the mysterious chest that came from the Tree of Harmony, nor anything about keys to unlock it! But something tells me that opening it is pretty important. I hope Princess Celestia has some ideas. If the library in Canterlot doesn't have anything, I-I don't know where else to look! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  My dearest Twilight, while it would be perfectly lovely to have you in Canterlot once more, I have another option in mind much closer to Ponyville. 

    Princess Celestia  As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library. 

    Twilight Sparkle  Wow! Look at all these ancient books! It's a veritable goldmine of information! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo! 
    Spike Whoa, whoa-whoa! Oof!  Uh, heh-heh. So, uh, Twilight. Uh, ready to head home? 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you kidding? This place is perfect! 
    Spike  
     

     

     
    Rainbow Dash I'm not gonna move. You move. 
    Applejack Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'. 
    Pinkie Pie This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare! 
    Rainbow Dash and Applejack Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie It's exciting! 
     
     
    Parcel Post Uh, whatcha'll doing? 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of "Most Daring Pony"! This is the final test the Bee Stare! Last pony to blink wins! 
    Parcel Post ... I'm gonna need my bees back. 
    Rainbow Dash But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is! 
    Parcel Post Eh, sorry about that.  
     
    Applejack Well, what do we do now? 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day!  Congratulations! You're tied! 
    Applejack Tied? 
    Rainbow Dash You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony! 
    Pinkie Pie I dunno! Numbers don't lie! I'd love to stay and keep keeping score, but I promised to help test the new school bell. I get to ring it all week, nonstop! And I don't even have to take turns, because no one else volunteered!  
    Rainbow Dash Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with another daring dare. 
    Applejack Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do. 

    Fluttershy Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason. 
    Rarity Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life! 
    Fluttershy Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it? 
    Rarity I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated. 
    Fluttershy I see... 
    Rarity I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line! 
    Fluttershy That does sound... very important. 
    Rarity Yes, well,  
    Fluttershy Um, are you sure you need those tapestries? 
    Rarity But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh... 
    Fluttershy  Angel! 

    Rarity Goodness! It's practically an artistic treasure trove of ancient good taste!  
    Fluttershy Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful! 
    Spike I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get. 
    Spike Oh, great. 
    Applejack Well, here we are! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony. 
    Applejack When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows! 
    Rainbow Dash You mean, like a ghost? 
    Applejack  Nopony knows! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 

    Rarity  This one is perfect! 
    Fluttershy Well, it certainly could use some restoration. 
    Rarity Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook? 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity  Maybe from below? 
     

    Rainbow Dash I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts. 
    Applejack You might wanna rethink your position on that. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash and Applejack  

    Rainbow Dash and Applejack  
    Applejack You saw that, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Run! 
     
    Fluttershy Ow... I think I hurt my wing. 
    Rarity Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! That tapestry is far too heavy. We'll just have to find a smaller one. 
    Fluttershy Oh, of course. 
    Rarity Where, pray tell, did you disappear to? 
    Fluttershy What do you mean? 
    Rarity While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around! You must have activated a secret door. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm sorry. 
    Rarity I suppose these ruins are chock full of them. 
    Fluttershy Really? 
    Rarity Absolutely. We must use the utmost care as weâ€” 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
     

    Rainbow Dash  Okay, so, maybe the legend is true! 
    Applejack Well, that's why I brought you here! I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Scared? I'm not scared! 
    Applejack Well, m-me neither! 
    Rainbow Dash Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony. 
    Applejack Deal. 
     
    Rainbow Dash But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave. 
    Applejack Me too! Humph! 

    Twilight Sparkle Find anything, Spike? 
    Spike Uh, nope. Nothing yet. 
     
    Spike Aaah! 
    Twilight Sparkle Angel? What are you doing here? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Maybe this is the book Princess Celestia was talking about! 

    Rainbow Dash I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack! 
    Applejack I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all! 
    Applejack Me neither! 
     
    Applejack Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs. 
    Applejack Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that. 

    Rarity I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise! 
    Fluttershy Oh dear. Angel? Rarity, have you seen him? 
    Rarity I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear. 
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out! 
    Rarity  I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm... 

    Rainbow Dash Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me. 
    Applejack Uh, I'm over here. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash and Applejack  
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy Rarity! What is it? 
    Rarity I felt something... alive! 
    Fluttershy  Angel! 
     
    Rarity Well, tapestries or no, I have had just about enough of secret passages, mysterious presences, and unappreciative castles!  
    Fluttershy But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle! He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all! 

    Angel  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, you've got to hear this.  I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the Hall of Hooves still gives her a bit of a fright, the trap door slide is Luna's favorite. 
    Spike "Hall of Hooves"? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Soon the Organ to the Outside will be finished. I can hardly wait. 
    Spike What's the "Organ to the Outside"? 
    Twilight Sparkle  I have no idea! 

     
     
    Applejack You hear that? 
    Rainbow Dash You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ? 
    Applejack Uh... maybe? 
    Rainbow Dash  I don't know what you're talking about! 
     

    Spike Uh, Twilight? Did you hear something? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart! 
     
    Angel  
    Spike Oh... kay. 

    Fluttershy  Angel! Angel! 
    Rarity I'm sure we'll find him. 
    Fluttershy Angel? 
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy Did you find Angel? Is he okay? 
    Rarity  They are perfect! No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art. 
    Fluttershy Oh! They're lovely, Rarity, but... I have to keep looking for Angel. Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him. 
    Rarity I'm right behind you! Won't...  a moment! 

    Applejack Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa!  It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal? 
    Applejack Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right? 

     
    Applejack Huh?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rarity  
     
    Fluttershy  
     
     
     
    Applejack Whoa-oa! 
     
    Applejack  
    Rarity Oh!  
     

     
    Rarity  Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state! 
     
    Rarity And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration! 

    Rainbow Dash Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right? 
     
    Rainbow Dash  

    Fluttershy  Rarity! I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke! 
     
     
    Fluttershy  

     
    Applejack  Rainbow? Hello? I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right? 

    Rarity  Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful! 
     
    Rarity Oof! 
     
    Fluttershy  Angel! Rarity! Oh... I hope you two are together. 
     
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got? 
     
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack  
     
     
     
    Fluttershy  Angel? 
    Applejack  
     
    Fluttershy AAANGEEEEEL!!! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle What in the world is that?! 
    Spike Oh, you know. Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart! 
    Twilight Sparkle No one likes sarcasm, Spike. 

     
    Spike What got into them? 
    Fluttershy  It's okay, Angel! You're okay! You're okay! 
    Applejack Yaaaaah! Shadows everywhere! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy  Aaangeeeeel! 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, everypony, stop! 
    Applejack Twilight? 
    Fluttershy Must... save... Angeâ€”! ...Oh. 
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy? What are you doing here? 
    Rarity She's with me... 
     
    Rarity  Thank you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Have you all spent the whole night running around, scaring each other? 
    Applejack Well, that depends. 
    Twilight Sparkle On what? 
    Rainbow Dash On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows. 
    Spike What's... the Pony of Shadows? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale. 
     
    Spike Then who's playing... that? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're going to find out. 

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  The Pony of Shadows! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, you guys! Did you know I can totally play the organ? Because I didn't! 
    All Pinkie?! 
    Pinkie Pie Check it out! 
     
    Rainbow Dash You're the Pony of Shadows? 
    Pinkie Pie  The pony of what? 
    Twilight Sparkle See? What'd I tell ya? 
    Applejack I thought you went to ring the school bell all week! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why... 

     

    Pinkie Pie So then, I decided to throw a "finish ringing the school bell" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a "finish ringing the school bell" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly. 
     
    Pinkie Pie I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party! 
     
    Rarity What party is that? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, the "everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ" party?  
     
    Pinkie Pie Duh! 

    Rarity I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory. 
    Fluttershy Now don't go running off again! Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened. Guess I let my imagination get the best of me. 
    Applejack I think we all did. 
    Pinkie Pie I always let my imagination run away from me! Then it comes back... with cake! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you. 
    Rarity You certainly did that, Twilight. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Why weren't you scared? 
    Twilight Sparkle Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters? 
    Fluttershy All of us? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too! 
    Rarity What a splendid idea! 
    Applejack I know what my first entry will be! "Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true." 
    Rainbow Dash Me too! 
    Pinkie Pie Me three! Because that means you two are still tied for Most Daring Pony! 
    Spike Heh, Shadow Ponies... How ridiculous is that? 

     

Daring Don't

    Rainbow Dash Four more months, four more months, four more months! I bet you're excited, huh? 
    Fluttershy Oh, my. I, uh, I could be excited. I don't really know. I wasn't really thinkâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, you gotta be excited! 
    Fluttershy Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm a little kinda sort of excited. 
    Rainbow Dash I thought so! 
    Fluttershy Yeah... So, um, why am I excited? 
    Rainbow Dash Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh? 

    Rainbow Dash  Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon? Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?! 
    Ahuizotl  
    Rainbow Dash Would she cower, turn tail and run? Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match forâ€” 
    Ahuizotl  Look out! 
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm not so sure she's gonna last another four months... 

     

    Rainbow Dash Three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days! Heya, Twilight! Aren't you excited thatâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Twilight Sparkle So glad you've finally made it! 
    Rainbow Dash What's everypony doing here? 
    Pinkie Pie We're having a holiday party!  
    Rainbow Dash So what holiday would today be? 
    Pinkie Pie National Random Holiday Party Day! Woo-hoo! 
    Rarity I've never heard of it either.  But the punch is quite tasty. 
    Pinkie Pie You might say the secret ingredient is...  
    Rainbow Dash How come nopony bothered to invite me? 
    Applejack I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well, in three months and twenty six more days, I'll be able to read the next one. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, haven't you heard? The release of the next book got pushed another two months. 
    Rainbow Dash  Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it! 
    Fluttershy Yeah. I can vouch for that... 
    Rainbow Dash Did they give a reason? 
    Twilight Sparkle The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes? 
    Rainbow Dash  How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh. Right. 
    Twilight Sparkle A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book... 
    Rainbow Dash Where she lives? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why? 
    Rainbow Dash Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing! So Iâ€“ I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm, I don't know... What she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy. 
    Rainbow Dash She can always just say no. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mmh... I suppose you're right... 
    Rainbow Dash Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address? 

    Twilight Sparkle You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respecâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait! Oh no. What happened? 
    Rainbow Dash Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already... 
     
     
    Applejack Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place. 
    Pinkie Pie Hmm... Maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob! 
    Rarity I hope A.K. Yearling's alright! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her? 
    Rainbow Dash I know! There might be no more books! Uh... But, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh. 
    A.K. Yearling What are you all doing here? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... A... K-K... Yearling...?  
    Twilight Sparkle We didn't do this! We swear! 
    A.K. Yearling What have you done to my house? 
    Applejack We didn't do this, Ms. Yearlingâ€” whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle We're awfully glad to see you're alright. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    A.K. Yearling  It's safe. 
    Rainbow Dash Great! Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster. Chop chop! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes! 
    Pinkie Pie You should tell that to those guys. 
    Henchponies  
    Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle A.K. Yearling is Daring Do! 

    Twilight Sparkle A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown! 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, come on, I knew it all along. 
     
    Henchponies  
    Applejack Amazing! 
    Rarity Incredible! 
    Pinkie Pie Wow! So much action! Whee! 
    Rainbow Dash Daring Do! 
     
     
    Dr. Caballeron Many thanks, Daring Do. As you've probably surmised, our earlier search for this treasure was... unsuccessful. So kind of you to find it for us. 
    Daring Do  Give it back, Caballeron! 
    Dr. Caballeron That's Doctor Caballeron to you. 
    Rainbow Dash  He's from book four Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams. He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The real Daring Do and the real Caballeron! 
    Daring Do So let me guess Ahuizotl has put you up to this? You're stealing the ring to give to him so his hold on the Fortress of Talacon will be good for eight centuries as foretold by prophecy! 
    Dr. Caballeron Close, but... no. I'm going to sell this to him, make a bundle, and retire from archaeology in splendor. 
    Daring Do  Caballeron, you fool! You're dooming the valley to eight centuries of unrelenting heat! 
    Dr. Caballeron To market, henchponies! 
    Daring Do  
    Fluttershy Uh... should we go in and help her, maybe? 
    All except Fluttershy Oh, right. 
    Rainbow Dash  Are you okay? 
    Daring Do I got this. 
    Fluttershy Um, she was just trying to help, Ms. Do. 
    Daring Do Daring Do doesn't need help. She handles her business herself. 
    Rainbow Dash We've gotta go help! 
    Twilight Sparkle You heard her! She says she works alone! 
    Rainbow Dash How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three! 
    Twilight Sparkle True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon! 
    Rainbow Dash But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero! 
    Twilight Sparkle But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless? 
    Rainbow Dash Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?! 
    Pinkie Pie You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point. 
    Rainbow Dash We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan... 
    Rainbow Dash I'm coming, Daring Do! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not a plan! 

    Rainbow Dash Come on, come on, come on... Bingo! Here I come, Daring Do! To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could everâ€“  Ow... That's starting to hurt. 
    Daring Do  
    Rainbow Dash Yow! Stop! 
    Daring Do Oh, it's just you. 
    Rainbow Dash Wait, don't go!  
    Daring Do  
    Rainbow Dash Wait, wait, wait! Let me help you! I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance. 
    Daring Do I. Work. Alone. 
    Rainbow Dash But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?! 
    Daring Do My work always involves secrets. And since you never know who you can trust, it's best never to trust anypony. 
    Rainbow Dash But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted! 
    Daring Do Look, I don't have time to argue- 
    Rainbow Dash Neither do I. Let's go! 
    Daring Do  Can't believe I'm even talking to her... 

     
    Rainbow Dash Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe-  Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Wow! 
     
     
    Daring Do  I have been led to believe you have in your possession an item of significant importance that might be... for sale. 
    Dr. Caballeron Oh, uh, well... I did have another buyer lined up, but he's not here, so... sounds like we have a deal. 
    Ahuizotl  Caballeron! 
    Daring Do Ahuizotl! 
    Ahuizotl The ring! 
    Dr. Caballeron  
     
    Ahuizotl  
    Rainbow Dash Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool... she's got this! 
    Ahuizotl The ring, Daring Do! Give it to me! 
    Daring Do Now, Ahuizotl, you know I love you, but I can't give you the ring 'til I've properly proposed. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Ahuizotl  
     
    Daring Do Bring it! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Daring Do, come on... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Daring Do! I've got your hat! You want me to toss it? Daring Do! Daring Do! 
    Daring Do  
    Rainbow Dash Whoa!  
     
    Daring Do  
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry, Daring Do! I'll come help you! Whoa! Ow. 
     
    Daring Do Don't bother! I'd say you've already helped plenty. 
    Rainbow Dash What have I done? 

    Rarity  Thank goodness you're alright! 
    Twilight Sparkle Quick, where does it hurt? 
    Rainbow Dash In here. Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake. 
    Rainbow Dash Whatever. Let's just go home. 
    Applejack We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever! 
    Rainbow Dash Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place. You were right, Twilight. We should've stayed out of this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her! 
    Rainbow Dash She doesn't want my help, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Perhaps. But she might need it anyway. 
    Rainbow Dash No. My hero's way better off without me. 
    Applejack This don't sound like you. 
    Pinkie Pie Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat? 
    Rarity Or pith helmet, as the case may be. 
    Rainbow Dash She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not? 

     
    Daring Do Surrender now, Ahuizotl, or I'll be forced to take you down!  
    Ahuizotl  Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss your amusing laughter-jokes. Now, I must leave to commence the ring-placing ceremony to unleash eight hundred years of unrelenting, sweltering heat! 
     
    Ahuizotl  
    Daring Do  
     
    Daring Do  
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha!  You can flap too, y'know! 
     
    Daring Do I was just about to save myself, y'know. 
    Rainbow Dash Of course. I just thought you might need this. 
    Daring Do Have I mentioned yet that I work alone? 
    Rainbow Dash Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't? 
    Daring Do  

     
    Ahuizotl  
    Applejack Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is! 
    Ahuizotl Hmph, place the ring, quickly! Get it! 
     
    Daring Do Come with me! Help me get all these rings off! 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Daring Do  If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse! 
    Rainbow Dash W-Was this your plan all along? 
    Daring Do I had to find a way to get into the fortress. 
    Rainbow Dash You did it on purpose?! Butâ€“ but I thoughtâ€” 
    Daring Do I didn't count on how heavy this ring would be, though... Guess having a little help can be handy sometimes. 
    Ahuizotl  
     
    Ahuizotl Stop her! 
    Daring Do  You can flap too, y'know! 
    Rainbow Dash  Ponies! Run! This place is goin' down! 
     
     
    Ahuizotl Daring Do! I will have my revenge! 
     
    Daring Do Could never have done this without you, Rainbow Dash. I've got a book to finish! 

    Rainbow Dash Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else. 
     
    Messenger Pony Package from A.K. Yearling. 
    Rainbow Dash Sweet! The new book a week before anypony else gets it!  Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! 

     

Flight to the Finish

    Cheerilee Today, we have two special guests with a very special announcement! Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria Games, Ms. Harshwhinny! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Thank you. Now, I'm sure you all know about the Equestria Games, where ponies from all over the land compete for glory in various athletic pursuits. Well, now you littlest ones will have the chance to compete for a weighty responsibility of your very own. 
    Rainbow Dash  Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part! 
    Students  
    Rainbow Dash That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?! 
    Diamond Tiara It's gotta be me! 
    Aura Maybe it's me! 
    Scootaloo Maybe it's us! 
    Snips and Snails Maybe it's us! 
     
     
    Snips Hey! It could happen! 

     

    Rainbow Dash So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Ms. Dash, will you please curb your over-enthusiastic outbursts? Now then, let me be clear on the rules. You ponies will form teams. Each team will create their own flag carrying routine. Everypony will be judged on grace, style and originality. There's a most complicated scoring system, which I will elaborate upon now. Firstly-- 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach!  That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it â€“- I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since! 
     
    Ms. Harshwhinny Professionalism, Ms. Dash. I must insist. If you want to keep your job as coach of these ponies, you must maintain a professional attitude and keep your emotions in check! Am I making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, "professionalism" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Hmph! Well, in three days time, Ms. Dash will accompany anypony competing to the Crystal Empire, where you will demonstrate your routines for me and the other judges, who will judge you very professionally. 
    Rainbow Dash Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho-- Ahem... Meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally? 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Ugh. Ponies, the most important thing is this Your routine needs to show what your town means to you. So, do Ponyville proud. Work hard, be bold, wow me. That is all! 
     

     
    Scootaloo So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing? 
    Apple Bloom I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific! 
    Sweetie Belle But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete! 
    Scootaloo Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in! 
    Apple Bloom Me too! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Me three! 
    Scootaloo Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right? 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Right! 
    Scootaloo So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... It's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends! 
    Apple Bloom Earth ponies like me! 
    Sweetie Belle Unicorns like me! 
    Scootaloo And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act. 
    Sweetie Belle We're gonna need a plan. 
    Apple Bloom And a lot of hard work! 
    Scootaloo And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses! 

    

        We're the toughest little ponies in town 
        Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around 
        We are a trio, work as a team 
        We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene 

        We get going when the going gets tough 
        We know our very best is just never enough 
        We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeated 
        We could take a little break, but we don't need it 

        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses 

        When we put our minds together, we can achieve 
        We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and you should believe 
        We've got determination to represent the nation 
        For the win 

        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 

        And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory 
        We can conquer any challenge we're in 
        We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses 
        Hearts strong as horses 

    Crusaders Whoa! 
     
    Crusaders Oof! 
     
    Diamond Tiara If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure. 
    Silver Spoon We already have the most divine routine planned. 
    Diamond Tiara It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else â€“ and I mean crush. 
    Scootaloo But we're winners! And we have  hearts-- 
    Silver Spoon Sure. But you know what you don't have? 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks! 
    Apple Bloom What does that have to do with flag carryin'? 
    Silver Spoon Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable. 
    Diamond Tiara And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle. 
    Scootaloo Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games. 
    Silver Spoon May the best ponies win! 
    Scootaloo Game on! 

    Rainbow Dash Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good! 
    Scootaloo Don't worry, we will! 
    Sweetie Belle Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close. 
    Diamond Tiara Let's watch the Cutie Mark "Goof-saders" do their saddle routine. 
    Silver Spoon They're gonna be a hot mess! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Scootaloo Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist! 
    Apple Bloom We are Earth ponies! 
    Sweetie Belle We are unicorns! 
    Scootaloo We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best... 
    Crusaders Ponyville forever! Yay! 
    Scootaloo It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think? 
    Rainbow Dash That was ama--  Overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go! 
    Apple Bloom Do y'all think she liked it? 
    Sweetie Belle I'm not really sure. 
    Scootaloo You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies! 
    Diamond Tiara Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win! 
    Silver Spoon But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks! 
    Diamond Tiara Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings. 

    Diamond Tiara Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive! 
    Sweetie Belle Wait... What? 
    Apple Bloom Um... Thanks? 
    Silver Spoon Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave. 
    Scootaloo Brave? Why? 
    Diamond Tiara Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact, it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three types of Ponyville ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony... 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon ...who can't even fly! 
    Apple Bloom What in tarnation does that have to do with anything? 
    Silver Spoon I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it? 
    Diamond Tiara I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago. 
    Scootaloo So what if my wings can't get me off the ground? 
    Diamond Tiara Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either. 
    Silver Spoon Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria. 
    Sweetie Belle Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that! 
    Silver Spoon I would've thought that was obvious. 
    Diamond Tiara Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will neverâ€”how shall I sayâ€”take off! 
    Sweetie Belle Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay? 
    Scootaloo This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing. 
    Sweetie Belle What? 
    Apple Bloom Why? 
    Scootaloo If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly! 
    Sweetie Belle Is that even possible? 
    Apple Bloom And by tomorrow? 
    Scootaloo Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard. 
    Apple Bloom Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem. 
    Scootaloo Well, I know this for sure â€“ flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice! 
    Sweetie Belle Is this a good idea? 
    Scootaloo Whoaaaaa! 
     
    Scootaloo I'll just work four times as hard! 
    Apple Bloom Probably not. 

    Scootaloo  Guys, guys, guys! Try it again! 
    Apple Bloom  But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired! 
    Scootaloo Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in-- 
     
    Scootaloo Not quite what I had in mind. We'll just... try that part again.  
    Apple Bloom  I liked the routine the way it was! 
    Sweetie Belle  Me too! But all she cares about now is flying! 
    Scootaloo Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on our final run-through for Rainbow Dash. I'm gonna get this, you'll see.  
     

    Rainbow Dash Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow. I know you're gonna absolutely, positively-- have a lot of fun, heheh. Okay, go!  
    Scootaloo  Ponyville! Home of the, um... 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  Friendship! 
    Scootaloo Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four-- no, three kinds of ponies. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle  Left, left! 
    Apple Bloom  I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and-- Sorry! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  
     
     
    Scootaloo Ta-da! Oof!  So? What'cha think? 
    Rainbow Dash That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning! 
    Scootaloo What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless... 
    Sweetie Belle I'm just too tired! I can't keep going! 
    Apple Bloom Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now! 
    Sweetie Belle She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore! 
    Scootaloo Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop? 
    Apple Bloom Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep. 
    Scootaloo So? Are you gonna leave me too? 
    Sweetie Belle We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo. 
    Scootaloo Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try twenty times as hard!  Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder! 
     
    Scootaloo  I can't fly. I just... can't. 

    Train conductor Crystal Empire! All aboard! 
    Sweetie Belle Scootaloo? Where is she? 
    Apple Bloom She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave! 
    Scootaloo Here I am... 
    Apple Bloom We were scared you were gonna miss the train! 
    Scootaloo I... I'm not going. 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle What?! 
    Scootaloo I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two. 
    Sweetie Belle I can't believe you're quitting on us! 
    Scootaloo But you're better off without me! 
    Sweetie Belle But that's not true, Scootaloo! 
    Apple Bloom You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her! 
    Scootaloo Fine! 
    Apple Bloom Fine! 
    Sweetie Belle Fine... 
    Train conductor All aboard! 
     
     

    Rainbow Dash How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad!  through the hoop! 
    Apple Bloom Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo. 
    Sweetie Belle She's staying home. 
    Rainbow Dash She's what?! 
    Apple Bloom She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'. 
    Rainbow Dash And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, actually, we kinda told her... 
    Apple Bloom ...uh, that we didn't want a quitter. 
    Rainbow Dash Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Come on! 
    Diamond Tiara Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Sweetie Belle I do not like them one bit. 
    Rainbow Dash Put on some speed, girls! 

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Throwing away your scooter?! 
    Scootaloo Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash Yup, but not just me. 
    Scootaloo I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train. 
    Apple Bloom We're not goin'. 
    Sweetie Belle Not without you, Scootaloo. 
    Rainbow Dash What's gotten into you, Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly. 
    Rainbow Dash And who said you had to? 
    Scootaloo But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games! 
    Rainbow Dash But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right? 
    Sweetie Belle Friendship. 
    Apple Bloom Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies... 
    Sweetie Belle ...unicorns... 
    Scootaloo ...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly? 
    Rainbow Dash Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town? 

    

        Got the moves, got the mojo... 

    

        No harder working pony around. 

    

        We are a trio, work as a team 

    

        We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene 

    Scootaloo So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was! And let's win this thing! 

    

        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 
        We've got hearts as strong as horses 

        And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory 
        We can conquer any challenge we're in 
        We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses 
        Hearts strong as horses 

     
    Crusaders Ponyville forever! Yay! 

     
    Ms. Harshwhinny  In the Equestria Games, the Ponyville flag will be carried by... 'Cutie Mark Crusaders'! 
     
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  

    Rainbow Dash Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Acceptable? Acceptable?! Why, it was totally stupendously the single most amazing thing I've ever seen!  
    Rainbow Dash Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember â€“ professionalism. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Ahem. Y-Yes, well, I-  
    Rainbow Dash and Crusaders  
    Scootaloo You know what this means, right? 
    Apple Bloom What? 
    Scootaloo We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Crusaders  

     

Power Ponies

     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, you really need to go to sleep! 
    Spike Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about toâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle "The Mane-iac"? 
    Spike The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hum Drum? 
    Spike Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed! 
    Twilight Sparkle Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw. 
    Spike Okay, okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Two more minutes. 
    Spike Yes! 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving! 
    Rainbow Dash You got it! 
    Spike Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part! 
    Pinkie Pie A little more to the left! No, the other left!  Awesome! That's perfect right where it is! On to the next painting! 
    Spike You sure you don't need any help? 
    Applejack Nah, that's okay. 
    Pinkie Pie  We have everything under control! 
    Spike Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash I'm good! 
    Spike  Isn't there anything I can help you with, Twilight? 
    Pinkie Pie  Don't worry about it, Spike! It's all good! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain? 
    Spike Hum Drum never stops the villain. He's just there for comic relief.  
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that! 
    Spike I could do it! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's okay, Spike. 
    Pinkie Pie Pony power! Weehee!! 
    Spike  
     

    Spike  Wait. What? How can that be the end?! What's... that? "You can... retr-" What? "You can... return..." Urgh! I know I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here... 
    Applejack Spike! Where are ya, Spike? 
    Rarity We're breaking for tea and biscuits! 
    Rainbow Dash Spike! 
    Spike  "You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is... defeated." Huh? "Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book"? What does that even mean? Whoa! Cool! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! What are youâ€” 
    Spike Heeeeeelp! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike!  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Weehee! 

    Spike Is this... Maretropolis? 
    Applejack Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on? 
    Spike Holy new personas, ponies! You're the... Masked Matter-Horn! Fili-Second! Zapp! R-Radiance! Mistress Mare-velous! Saddle Rager! You're the... Power Ponies! 
     
     
    Mane-iac Power Ponies!  How kind of you to join us! 
    Main cast Huh? 
    Mane-iac  

    Mane-iac  
    Applejack Did she just call us... Power Ponies? 
    Spike You're the... the superheroes from my comic book! It somehow zapped us all in here! 
    Rainbow Dash So somepony zap us back out! 
    Spike My comic book! It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac! Your arch-nemesis! 
    Mane-iac Time for the mane event! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie! Where'd she go?! 
    Pinkie Pie Wheeeeeeee! 
    Spike She could be miles away from here by now! Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis! 
     
     
    Applejack Whoa!  
    Mane-iac  
    Spike Twilight! Freeze her mane! 
    Twilight Sparkle Do what? 
    Spike You're the Masked Matter-Horn! You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn! 
     
    Mane-iac You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this.  
    Main cast  
     
    Spike Dash! Quick! You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature! Unholster the lightning bolt! 
     
     
    Spike Lightning, not a tornado! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa-whoa! 
    Main cast  
    Spike Fluttershy! You're Saddle Rager! Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster! 
    Fluttershy Oh, gosh! That wouldn't... be very... polite! 
    Spike Ugh! Rarity! Use your jewelry to create attack constructs! 
    Rarity What's an attack construct?! 
    Spike Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear! 
     
    Spike Something useful! 
     
    Spike The Electro-Orb! 
    Mane-iac Well, this has been quite the mane-raising experience. But I really must be going.  
     
    Mane-iac Why, thank you, Hum Drum!  
     
    Spike I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no...  Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city! 
    Applejack But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter! 
    Spike You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  That was spin-tastic! 
    Applejack Lemme get this straight We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world? 
    Spike Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it! 
    Rainbow Dash No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers! 
    Spike Almost all of us have superpowers... 
    Rarity But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape! 
    Spike Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless... 
    Twilight Sparkle Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then. 
    Spike Yeah, good thing... 
    Rainbow Dash So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device? 
    Spike Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up! 
    Applejack Lead the way, Spike! 
    Rainbow Dash Then leave the rest to us! 
    Spike  

     
    Spike There it is! 
    Applejack Is that a... shampoo factory? 
    Twilight Sparkle All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me andâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So much for "element of surprise". 
    Spike Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later. 
    Mane-iac  
    Rarity She's home. 
     
    Applejack Time to Power Pony up! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Nice catchphrase! 
    Twilight Sparkle Freeze ray! 
     
    Rarity It's an improvement, darling. 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
     
    Rarity Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory! 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Henchpony My hair! 
    Rainbow Dash Seriously? You aren't even just a little angry right now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home! 
    Mane-iac I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time! 
    Rainbow Dash Just watch us! 
    Spike The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless! 
     
     
    Rarity We'll just see about that! 
     
     
     
    Mane-iac  
    Spike Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?! 
    Fluttershy Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified! 
     
    Spike Don't spray! 
    Mane-iac  Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on you? Rather pointless, don't you think? 
    Main cast  
     
     

    Spike What am I supposed to do? I'm useless. No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. They're the ones with superpowers. They've probably already figured out how to escape. 
     
    Spike Or not! 
     
     
     
     
    Mane-iac Congratulations, Power Ponies!  
    Fluttershy Ahem. I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony? 
    Mane-iac Hum Drum? Little guy? No superpowers whatsoever?  He's utterly useless! 
     
     
    Mane-iac Puh-lease. Everypony knows you just keep him around because you  feel sowwy for him. Wah. Wah. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe in your world. But in our world, Spikeâ€” uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! Always! 
    Rest of Power Ponies  
    Spike I'm not like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I do come through! And they need me now! 
    Mane-iac  
     
    Henchponies  
     
     
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Way to go, Spike! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Get mad! 
    Fluttershy I'm trying!  
    Pinkie Pie Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! 
    Mane-iac Over there! There! There! Idiots! 
     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Need a place to put these guys! 
     
     
    Applejack Hold it right there, partner! 
     
    Henchponies  
     
    Spike Fluttershy, where are you going? 
    Fluttershy You seem to have everything under control. 
    Spike Fluttershy, we need you! You have to power up! 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad. 
     
     
     
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness! Are you okay?  
     
     
    Fluttershy  
    Mane-iac  
    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy  
    Mane-iac My mane!  
     
     
    Spike Once again, the day is saved byâ€” 
    Main cast  

     
    Rainbow Dash Awesome! 
    Applejack Whoo-ee! 
    Main cast  
    Rainbow Dash Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?! 
    Applejack You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso? 
    Pinkie Pie Cupcakes? 
    Rarity How did youâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away! 
    Spike I'm just glad to be back. 
    Twilight Sparkle We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful. 
    Spike And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend. 
    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book? 
    Spike This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics. Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted! 
    Main cast  
    Spike I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines! Hey, wait up! I'm an important part of this team, remember?! 
     

     

Bats!

    Applejack Any minute now... 
     
    Applejack Yee-haw! It's officially Apple Bucking Day! Look at all those apples! Ripe and juicy, perfect for buckin'!  
     
     
    Applejack What the heck is goin' on?  They're back! 
     

     

     
    Applejack Attention! This is a Sweet Apple Acres code red! I need all hooves â€“ and claws â€“ on deck! 
    Rarity Calm down, Applejack. 
    Applejack Calm down?! How can I calm down at a time like this?! Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres! 
    Twilight Sparkle But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard. 
    Applejack The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats. They're vampire fruit bats! I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Spike Awesome! 
    Applejack This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition.  You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this? 
    Rarity Applejack! When you go big, you really go big! 
    Applejack Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone. 
    Applejack Yeah, right. Be my guest. 

     
    Fluttershy Um, excuse me, Mr. Vampire Bat-- 
     
    Fluttershy We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone? 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack Well? What'd he say? 
    Fluttershy Um... yes. 
    Applejack Huh?! 
    Fluttershy But... it could've been a no. 
    Applejack Oh. 
    Fluttershy This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language. 
    Applejack Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard! These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters! 
    Fluttershy Monsters?! Oh, that's a bit harsh, don't you think? 
    Applejack No, I do not. 

    

        Those vampire bats will give you a fright 
        Eating apples both day and night 
        They rest for a minute, maybe three 
        Then they're eatin' every apple in your apple tree 

        They don't care about nada, not zilch, no, nothin' 
        'Cept bringin' about an orchard's destruction 

    

        Now wait just a minute, there's another side to this 
        And if I did not defend them, then I would be remiss 
        These bats are mamas and papas too 
        They care for their young just like we ponies do 

    

        Oh, give me a break, you're bein' too kind 
        These creatures have a one-track mind 
        The orchard is not their restaurant 
        But do they ever think what others may want? 
        No! They don't! And that is just a fact 
        These bats, they simply don't know how to act 

    

        That's where I have to disagree 
        They're loyal to their family 
        Spreading seeds both far and wide 

    

        You see one comin', you'd better run and hide! 
        They're big and ugly and mean as sin 
        Will ya look at the state my trees are in? 

    

        They help your trees, they'll grow stronger faster 

    

        They've turned my life to a total disaster! 

    

        Well, I for one don't have a doubt 
        These vermin must be stamped right out 

    

        I second that, they've got to go 
        These bats, they've got to hit the road 

    

        It comes down to just one simple fact 
        They've crossed the line, it's time to fight them back! 

    

        Stop the bats! Stop the bats! 
        Make them go and not come back! 
        Stop the bats! Stop the bats! 
        Make them go and not come back! 
        Stop the bats! Stop the bats! 
        Make them go and not come back! 

    

        Yes, it comes down to just one simple fact 
        They've crossed the line, it's time that we attack! 

    Rarity I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument. These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful. 
    Applejack So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard. 
    Pinkie Pie  Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up! 
    Fluttershy Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we... let them have part of the orchard? 
    Applejack  Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?! 
    Fluttershy They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees! 
    Applejack Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares!  Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter! 
    Rainbow Dash What about the cider? There was still cider, right? 
    Applejack Not...a...drop. 
    Rainbow Dash No cider?! No cider?! We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now! 
    Applejack If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...! 

    Twilight Sparkle So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention. 
    Fluttershy  Oh no. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats. 
    Fluttershy Oh, gosh, I don't know. 
    Rainbow Dash What's the problem? You've used the Stare plenty of times before! 
    Fluttershy Yes, but it's not something I take lightly. I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances. 
    Applejack This circumstance is plenty dire to me! 
    Rainbow Dash Me too! Think of the cider! Won't somepony please think of the cider?! 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats  vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong! 
    Twilight Sparkle But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too? 

    Applejack So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not? 
    Fluttershy Um... Um... Okay, I'll do it. 
    Rarity Good choice. I knew you wouldn't side with those icky bats!  
    Fluttershy They're not icky. 
    Rainbow Dash First round of cider's on me! 
    Applejack Hold it right there! We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first. Time's a-wastin'! 

     
    Rarity  Ew, ew, ew, ewwww! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity  
    Applejack Good work, everypony! I think we got 'em all!  Now all we need is for you do to your Stare. 
    Fluttershy Oh, um, are you sure I really need-- Okay. I really, really, really hate to do this to you... I just hope you can forgive me... 
     
    Applejack Good... Now you go, Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle You can stop staring, Fluttershy. 
    Spike Did it work? 
    Applejack Only one way to find out for sure. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ye-he-heah, whoo! 
    Applejack My crop is saved! Yee-haw! 
    Rainbow Dash We'll be drinking cider all winter long! 
    Applejack I wanna thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you. 
    Spike Aw, don't mention it, Applejack. It was my pleasure! Really! 
    Applejack Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'! 
    Fluttershy  

    Applejack Apple Bucking Day, take two! 
     
    Applejack Yee-haw! Time to collect those juicy, sweet apples!  
     

    Twilight Sparkle The spell didn't work! 
    Applejack You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work! I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures! 
    Rainbow Dash I hear ya, Applejack! C'mon, everypony! Let's track down those vampire bats! 
     
     
    Applejack Wait a minute... I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry. 
    Rarity But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples... 
    Twilight Sparkle Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this? 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry. I don't. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act. 
    Rarity And how do you propose we do that? 
    Twilight Sparkle A stakeout...! 

    Rainbow Dash  The witching hour... 
     
    Fluttershy Maybe we should just call this off. Not sure about the rest of you guys,  
    Rarity Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay. Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed? 
    Rest of main cast Agreed! 
    Applejack Does everypony have their pony signals? Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious. 
    Pinkie Pie I got it. Something suspicious... 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie Whatcha doin'?! 
    Applejack Alright, now everypony split up. We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard. Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere. 
    Fluttershy I have a bad feeling about this. A really bad feeling about this... That apple... It looks...  

     
    Pinkie Pie What was that?!  It's pony signal time! 

    Rarity Who's there? Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead...  Or maybe there is! I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing... 

    Rainbow Dash Uh... who's there? Answer me or you'll regret it! Fine, have it your own way! Take that, you, you, you... scarecrow... Oh. 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, what is it? 
    Pinkie Pie Suspicious! 
    Fluttershy  

    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy? Yoo-hoo! Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity That's not Fluttershy... That's Flutterbat! 
    Twilight Sparkle We've gotta get her down from there! 
    Rarity Uh... Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and... do stop being a vampire bat. 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Fluttershy! It's me, Rainbow Dash! Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  Whoa! Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready. 
    Pinkie Pie Flutterbat on the loose! Run for your lives! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch. 
    Pinkie Pie She's just biding her time! Waiting for the right moment to pounce! 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies. Not even vampire bats. 
    Pinkie Pie But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies! I'm not taking any chances! 
    Rarity How did this happen? That's what I don't understand. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think this was actually our fault. 
    Rainbow Dash Our fault? 
    Applejack And how'd you figure that? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right! 
    Pinkie Pie Then what are we waiting for? Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all! 
    Rainbow Dash Hit the deck! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Follow that bat! 

    Rarity I can't believe we lost her! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Fluttershy, where are you? 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack Look out! Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time! 
    Applejack That's the least of my worries. I just want my friend back. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  There she is! 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack There she goes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us. 
    Applejack But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell? 
    Pinkie Pie Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat. 
    Twilight Sparkle  That's it! 

    Twilight Sparkle Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations! 
    Rainbow Dash So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh? 
    Applejack  
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  She's coming! 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy Oh... where am I? 
    Rest of main cast  
    Applejack Thank goodness you're okay! 
    Fluttershy But... what happened to me? 
    Pinkie Pie You turned into a vampire pony! 
    Fluttershy  I tried to eat ponies?! 
    Pinkie Pie Of course not! 
    Fluttershy So I wasn't a vampire? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! 
    Fluttershy Yes I was, or yes I wasn't? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, you were! 
    Fluttershy But I didn't try and eat ponies? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! 
    Fluttershy I did?! 
    Pinkie Pie No! 
    Fluttershy I'm confused... 
    Rarity Me too... and I was there! 

     
     
    Applejack Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place. 
    Fluttershy And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees. 
    Rainbow Dash Does that mean what I think it means? 
    Applejack Yup! More cider too. 
    Rainbow Dash Yea-he-heah, whoo! 

    Spike Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary... 
    Applejack Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted. 
    Fluttershy And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right. Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'. 
    Applejack Now, how about we celebrate our stronger than ever friendship with a nice, ripe, juicy apple? 
    Pinkie Pie

Rarity Takes Manehattan

    Spike There you are, Rarity! That's the last of your bags. 
    Rarity Actually, Spike, I've got one last pile of bags, over there. Won't you be a dear? 
    Spike Sure... I'll be a dear...  
    Rarity An entire week in the fabulous city of Manehattan! Plus, all of my very best friends there with me! 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course we'd all come along to support you during Fashion Week, Rarity! 
    Fluttershy Not that you'll need it. We're sure you'll win. 
    Rarity  I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that you'll all be there with me! However... Perhaps I can show you... 
    Twilight Sparkle What's that? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know! A paper fan! 
    Rarity No, it'sâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie A magic trick! You know, where I pick a card and remember what it is and then you put it back in the deck so you can't look at it andâ€” 
    Rarity These are tickets to the hottest musical on Bridleway! 
    Twilight Sparkle You couldn't mean Hinny of the Hills... because that show's been sold out for months! Or could you?! 
    Rarity I could. I do. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, Rarity, you didn't have to do that, but... since you did... 
    Main cast sans Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie This trip is fun already! I love jumping up and down! Whee-hee! 

     

     

    Rarity Come along, ponies! I found us a place to stay only a block from the train station in the very heart of this glorious metropolis! 

    Applejack Hey, look! That's the theatre where Hinny of the Hills is playin'! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Rarity! How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night? 
    Rarity Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings. 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash Cool! 
    Rarity That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you! 
    Applejack So then you can do something nice for us! 
    Fluttershy Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills! 
    Rainbow Dash Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria! 
    Applejack It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed. Normally she doesn't even like musicals. 
    Rainbow Dash I know. Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat? Who does that? 

    

        Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me 
        Such a huge bustling community 
        And there's always opportunity 
        To do the friendly thing 

        If some are grouchy, pay no mind 
        Surprise instead with something kind 
        Lo and behold, you may just find 
        A smile is what you bring 

    "Luggage Cart" Welcome to the Manefair Hotel! Please allow me to take those bags to your room for you! 
    Rarity Only if you'll accept this gratuity first. 
    "Luggage Cart" Oh-ho-ho! I'll get your change! 
    Rarity Do keep it all. I insist! 

    

        Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can give 
        Generosity, I'm here to set the bar 
        Just sit back and watch how I live 

    Rarity After you. 
    Tourist Pony 1 Why, thank you. 
    Rarity Please, take mine. 
    "Wisp" Wow, okay. 

    

        Some may say, "Rarity, 
        Don't be so big-hearted and bold 
        Treating strangers like they're friends 
        This town's too big and cold" 

        But this is how I play my cards 
        I'm not about to fold 
        Where I see a frown, I go to town 
        Call me the smile patrol 

    

        Oh, Manehattan, what you do to us 

    

        What if you find a Gloomy Gus? 

    

        It's no intimidatin' thing 

    

        Just be kind without a fuss 

    

        Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can do 
        Generosity, you are the key 
        Manehattan, I'm here just for you 
        Just for you 

    Rarity  To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria! Oh, it would be my dream come true! 
    Twilight Sparkle Is there anything left to do we can help you with? 
    Rarity Hm, nothing I can think of. The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy. 
    Fluttershy Sounds amazing. 
    Rarity There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, that's funny. Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now! 
     
    Rarity Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town! If I don't get there, I'm disqualified! Taaaaxiii! 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! We've gotta help her find a cab, now! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm on it! Hey, buddy! Is this cab taken? 
    Cherry Fizzy The line ends back there, "buddy"! 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? What? Does everypony in this town want a cab? 
    Rarity I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible! 
    Twilight Sparkle Please won't you let her have this taxi? She has somewhere very important to be right away! 
    Businesspony Not likely! She can get in line like the rest of us! 
    Ponies  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, it's no use! The cab drivers just drive right past to get to the next pony in line! 
    "Pronto" New wheel works like a charm! So now which of you nice folks are hoppin' in? 
    Rarity Fashion runway plaza in seven minutes. Can you make it? 
    "Pronto" Hang on! 
    Rarity Ta-ta! 
    Spike Whew, that was close. 
    Main cast sans Spike  
    Spike Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something? 
    Main cast sans Spike The dresses! 

    Rarity  Good afternoon, I'm here for Fashion Week! 
    Janine Manewitz Everypony's gathered in front of the runway and about to start, so you'll just have to bring your dresses along with you and store them backstage later. 
    Rarity Myâ€“ My dresses! How could I possibly forget them?!  I'm dooooomed! 
    "Luggage Cart" Got 'em right here, ma'am! Your friends told me you need these in a hurry, so I offered to race 'em over myself. "Anything for that nice mare," I told 'em! 
    Rarity You're a lifesaver! 

    Rarity  I made it! And with seconds to spare! Hello, everypony. Pleased to meet you all. 
    Prim Hemline Rarity, I presume. 
    Rarity You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event. How do youâ€”? 
    Prim Hemline Miss Rarity, how is it that all your competitors are here half an hour early, and yet you arrive seconds before we begin? 
    Rarity Uhhhh...  Just... lucky, I guess. 
    Prim Hemline Once we're done here, you're to finish setting up backstage, so you'll be ready for your run-through appointment. You show your designs last. We keep to a precise schedule, so let's try to be more than a few seconds early, hmm? Tomorrow is the contest to see which one of you gets to stay to meet top designers all across the city. The rest of you must go home early. So sad. Dismissed! 
    Suri Polomare  I'm so glad you made it, Rarity! 
    Rarity Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out! 
    Suri Polomare Don't you remember me? Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League? 
    Rarity Oh, yes, of course, of course! Iâ€“ I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years! 
    Suri Polomare Because I moved here to make it in the big city. , okay? 
    Rarity Oh, good for you, Surâ€” 
    Suri Polomare Ooh, it's so good to see you! And now here we are, competing! , okay? 
    Rarity Yes, yes. Well, good luck! 
    Suri Polomare Oh, I don't need luck. Would you like a hoof with your things? 
    Rarity Why, thank you so much! 

    Suri Polomare My, your collection is gorgeous! 
    Rarity Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so! 
    Suri Polomare It's alright, but nothing like this! Take my culottes, for example â€“ they are simply crying out for just the right accent, but I haven't the slightest notion where Iâ€”  Actually... just a touch of this fabric could be perfect with it. Wâ€“ Oh, hey, would you mind terribly if I took a swatch? 
    Rarity Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra. 
    Suri Polomare You're sure? 
    Rarity Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it... is? 

    Rarity Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes! 
    Janine Manewitz Get in line over there. Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous, did you make that yourself? 
    Rarity Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmeryâ€” 
    Suri Polomare ... 
    Prim Hemline Oh, bravo! I've never seen anything like it! 
    Rarity You stole my fabric! 
    Suri Polomare  I didn't steal it, okay? You gave it to me, 'member? 
    Rarity I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?! 
    Suri Polomare Fast? Hah! Coco Pommel here took practically forever. Nearly got me completely disqualified. 
    Coco Pommel Well, I wanted to make sure you'd win, so I took the extra time toâ€” 
    Suri Polomare Quiet! I pay an assistant to sew and get coffee, not talk. 'Kay? 
    Rarity  How could this happen? 
    Suri Polomare Aw, sweetie, don't blame yourself. It takes some small-town fillies a while to learn it's everypony for herself in the big city, m'kay? 
    Rarity  
    Suri Polomare Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor. Now get me some coffee! 

    Twilight Sparkle Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun! 
    Rainbow Dash Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed! 
    Applejack First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done. 
    Pinkie Pie Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern! 
    Fluttershy And after that... 
    Main cast sans Spike Hinny of the Hills!  
    Rainbow Dash Is... everything okay? 
    Pinkie Pie You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right? 
    Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash But he said he brought them. 
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Now, Rarity, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes. 
    Rest of main cast sans Rarity  
    Applejack Come on, Rarity, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business! 
    Rarity  This new line is going to be marvelous! Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I still have a chance after all! 

     
    Rarity Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there! 
    Twilight Sparkle You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working. 
    Rarity Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then... 
    Rarity Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! "Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!" 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you? 
    Rarity What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town! 
     
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle There. That's the last of them. 
    Rarity  Finally! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're welcome! 

    Prim Hemline Let's have another round of applause for Suri Polomare's amazing collection. 
     
    Prim Hemline That fabric! So original! 
    Rarity  
    Suri Polomare  Well look who's here. Here to show off your copycat collection, mm? Heh. 
    Prim Hemline And now, Rarity from Ponyville with her brand new line â€“ and I mean "brand new" â€“ Hotel Chic. 
     
     
    Rarity Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with... My friends. They didn't come. What have I done? 
     

     
    Prim Hemline Rarity, they all adore you! Aren't you going to tell them about your fabulous pieces? 
    Rarity I have to go. 
    Prim Hemline  Come back at once! 
     
    Prim Hemline This is unheard of! 

    "Luggage Cart" How do you do, ma'am? Contest going well? 
    Rarity No time to talk. I have to find my friends! 
    "Luggage Cart" Oh, uh, they're gone already. I saw them headed out this morning. 
    Rarity Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine. Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness. What have I done?! Oh... here you are. 
    "Luggage Cart" But miss, Iâ€“ I didn't do anything! 
     

    

        Oh, Manehattan, what have I done? 
        The thought of Fashion Week was fun 
        But I went way too far 
        My friends gave to me in ways so kind 
        And I gave them nothing but a hard time 

        And now alone I stand 
        And now alone I stand 

     
    Rarity I need a moment with Prim Hemline. I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first forâ€” 
    Suri Polomare Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while. She's pretty furious. Isn't that right? 
    Coco Pommel Um... yes. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home! 
    Twilight Sparkle We missed the show because we overslept. Suri told us you lost. I'm really sorry. 
    Rarity I lost? You know what? I don't even care. I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you. Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did. How could you ever see past it? 
    Applejack Yeah, you were pretty rotten. 
    Rainbow Dash Wow, Applejack. I know your thing is honesty, but come on! 
    Twilight Sparkle Last night we may not have seen you at your best, but we know you. And we would never let one thing like that change how we feel about you. 
    Rarity Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Suri Polomare And that is how it's done. Pretty clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it?  Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we? 

    Hinny of the Hills  And I'm a dancing pony! 
    Main cast  
    Applejack Wow! That was even better than I imagined! 
    Rainbow Dash I loved it!  Uh, I mean, it was a'ight. 
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us? 
    Rarity Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show! 
    Fluttershy Um, here in Manehattan? 
    Rarity Well, um... yes... it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Rarity But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity! 
    Applejack We know. We're happy for you, Rarity. We're just sad for us. 
    Coco Pommel Mind if I join you? 
    Rarity Sure. Come on down. This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week.  With my name on it! But I thought I lost! 
    Coco Pommel You didn't. You won. Suri was hoping that if you didn't claim your prize, the judges would consider it a forfeit and first place would go to her. So she lied to make you and your friends go away, and, well, I lied too. I've worked for Suri for so long, I started to believe that it really is everypony for herself in this town. Until I saw how generous you were with your friends and how generous they were with you. It made me start believing there was something better for me out there. So, Iâ€“ I quit. I brought you something to say thank you. 
    Rarity Hm. I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri. How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show? 

    Rarity Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends. 

     

Pinkie Apple Pie

    Pinkie Pie Whatcha doin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Aaagh! 
    Pinkie Pie "Aaagh" yourself! But that doesn't answer my question, silly.  
    Twilight Sparkle Just some genealogical research. 
    Pinkie Pie Ohhh.  I don't know what that is. 
    Spike Genealogy is the study of family history. Y'know, where ponies come from and who they're related to. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, fascinating. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe you should pick one from the... top? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh-huh... Interesting... I see... Hmm, that makes sense... Not much of a surprise there... WHAT?!? This is the most amazing thing ever! Why didn't you tell me how amazing this is?! Genealogy is better than cotton candy on top of a fountain of chocolate!  You'll never believe who it says I'm related to! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, cousin! 

     

    Applejack This is just so excitin', I can hardly believe it! 
    Pinkie Pie I know! Isn't it the best? 
    Apple Bloom I have another sister! I have another sister! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, you actually have a fourth cousin twice removed by a fifth cousin, but that's like exactly like a sister! 
    Applejack I'd try to tone it down a little around non-family members, because I don't want to make them jealous, but... 
    Apple Bloom This is the best family ever! 
     
    Applejack It really is. You are gonna love bein' an Apple. I mean, you've got the playful one... 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack The strong one... 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
     
    Applejack And of course, there's Granny Smith, who knows everythin' about everythin'! 
    Granny Smith A Ponyville snail can hibernate for up to forty-eight moons! 
    Pinkie Pie Who knew? 
    Applejack And then there's me.  Do you smell that sweet apple air, Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack That was rhetorical. Of course you smell it. You're an Apple now! 
    Apple Bloom And Applejack is the one responsible for it! 
    Applejack Aw, Apple Bloom, that is sweet, but-- 
    Apple Bloom It's true! I mean she keeps us all organized and on schedule and does her own part on top of it all! 
    Big McIntosh and Granny Smith Mm-hmm. 
    Pinkie Pie I was already super happy as a Pie! And now I get to be a part of this amazing family too? 
    Apple Bloom It's even more amazin' now that you're in it!  We're family, we're family, you an' me are family! 
    Pinkie Pie Best family twirl everrrrrrr! 
     
    Applejack Huh, I just can't believe we've never heard anythin' about this before! Hmm... 
    Apple Bloom What's wrong, sis? 
    Applejack I'm not seein' where exactly it says we're family. 
    Pinkie Pie It's riiiiiiiii-  -iiiiiight here! 
    Applejack It... is? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh-huh. Applesauce of the Apple family lineage is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family! 
    Applejack I see the part about our great, great auntie Applesauce and fourth cousin twice removed part, but that last bit's awful smudged. Are you sure it says 'Pie'? 
    Pinkie Pie I guess it is a little smudged, but I see most of it there, and when I read it, I knew in my heart it was true! 
    Granny Smith Well, ain't that just the sweetest thing! 
    Applejack It is, it is. I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure. 
    Apple Bloom So how are we supposed to find out for sure? 
    Granny Smith Ehhhh... Oh! Cousin Goldie Delicious! Her cabin's practically an Apple family history museum! If anypony has the records to back up Pinkie's theory, it's her! 
    Applejack Huh, I suppose we could always... I mean, Goldie Delicious doesn't live that far away, and we haven't been on one as a family in a real long time... Are y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? 
    Apple family Family road trip! 

    Granny Smith Has anypony seen my travelin' bonnet? 
    Apple Bloom Isn't that it on your head? 
     
    Granny Smith No! 
    Apple Bloom It looks an awful lot like-- 
    Granny Smith Well, it ain't, and that's final! 
    Applejack Hey, everypony? Since Pinkie Pie's back home gettin' her stuff for the trip, can y'all gather round? I just wanted to say somethin' real quick. 
    Granny Smith I've had somethin' in my teeth this whole time, haven't I? Gadsnickety, what a way to welcome a family member! 
    Applejack Er, no, Granny, your teeth are fine. I just wanted to be sure that we're all on the same page about showin' Pinkie Pie how awesome a family we really are. We want her to get to know the family she's been born into, but, like, the best version of it, y'know? 
    Granny Smith Oh, . Don't you worry, honey. We're a great family, and she can't help but see it. 
    Apple Bloom I'll bet my future cutie mark's gonna be a picture of me bein' the best behaved pony ever! That's how good I'm gonna be! Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Pinkie Pie Are y'all ready to go? Because I'm ready to go-go-go! 
    Applejack Er, Big Mac? Are you sure we really need all that stuff? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Are you sure you're strong enough to really pull all that stuff? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all? 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup! 
    Applejack Then lets get this show on the road! 

    Applejack C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one! 
    Granny Smith Hot-diggity! 
    Applejack Yee-haw! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

    

        We've traveled the road of generations 
        Joined by a common bond 
        We sing our song 'cross the pony nation 
        From Equestria and beyond 

    

        We're Apples forever, Apples together 
        We're family, but so much more 
        No matter what comes, we will face the weather 
        We're Apples to the core 

    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

    

        There's no place that I'd rather be 
        Than travelin' with my family 
        Friends all around come to join and see 
        As we sing out across the land 

    

        We're Apples forever, Apples together 
        We're family, but so much more 
        No matter what comes, we will face the weather 
        We're Apples to the core 

    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

    

        We're peas in a pod, we're thick as thieves 
        Any clichÃ© you can throw at me 
        We're here for each other, through thick and thin 
        You're always welcome with your Apple kin 
        Wheeeeee! 

    

        You're more fun than the color pink 
        Or balloons flying over your favorite drink 
        The love I feel here is swim, not sink 
        As we party across this land 

    Apples All right! 

    

        We're Apples forever, Apples together 
        We're family, but so much more 
        No matter what comes, we will face the weather 
        We're Apples to the core! 

    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
     

    Applejack Big Mac! I thought you saidâ€“ Uh, I thoughtâ€“ I mean, not that I'm blamin' you, because we don't blame in this family, but I thought you said all this stuff wasn't gonna be too heavy. 
    Apple Bloom How're we supposed to get to Goldie Delicious now? 
    Granny Smith I don't know, but I don't see how we can go back now either. We're closer to cousin Goldie's that we are to home. 
    Pinkie Pie  I have the best... idea... ever! Family river trip! 
    Applejack Heh. Just one problem. We haven't got a raft.  'Bout the only thing that didn't get packed. 
    Granny Smith Well, back in the old days, we used to use the sap from a sugar pine tree to glue things together. 
    Applejack That is, uh, fascinatin'... Don't know that it's helpful, but it is fascinatin'... 
    Granny Smith Pfft! 'Not helpful', my patootie! We're gonna build ourselves a raft out of these here jalopy parts and keep it held together with sugar pine sap! 
    Applejack Hm, worth a shot! 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! 

    Applejack Could be worse, I guess. Now remember, this time we're only packin' the necessities. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait a second! 
     
    Pinkie Pie This one is for the scrapbook! 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie, when did you have time to make this? 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack, when you're family, you make the time. 
     
    Applejack Woo-hoo! We did it! 
    Pinkie Pie Say 'soaked'! 
     

    Pinkie Pie So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! That is deep! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Uh-oh... All right, y'all. Please tell me that the map didn' get wet. 'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now. 
    Apple Bloom Found it!

        Who's got the map? 
        I got the map! 
        M to the A to the yeah, that's right, P 
        Ain't no other pony found a map like me 
        I'm Applelâ€” 

    Uh-oh. 
    Applejack  
    Everypony  
     
    Apple Bloom  
    Applejack  All you had to do was bring it to me. No singin', no dancin', no games. Just walk it over! 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup. 
    Pinkie Pie Say 'best siblings ever'! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, that's another keeper! 
    Granny Smith It's okay, y'all! I travelled down this river as a filly and I know it like the back of my hoof! 
    Applejack Are you sure you know which way to go? 
    Granny Smith Does a June bug like to hide in a tree? 
    Applejack Uh... I don't know. 
    Granny Smith Well, I do know! And I also know we wanna head southeast! Now step aside, young'un! 
    Applejack Um, Granny? 
    Granny Smith Myuh-huh? 
    Applejack Are we supposed to go through a cave? 
    Granny Smith Ah, don't worry, child! The scariest cave in Equestria was down that other way! 
    Apple Bloom The scariest cave in Equestria? 
    Granny Smith Oh, it's a fright all right! Filled with creatures that'll eat ya soon as look at ya! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, sounds scary. Tell us more! 
    Granny Smith Ponies go in... but they never come out! 
    Applejack And you're sure it's not that cave? The one we're headin' straight for? 
    Granny Smith Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack Heh... you sure did. 
    Granny Smith Alrighty then. Now everypony just sit on back an' leave the steerin' to your old Granny Smith. 
    Applejack  
    Granny Smith See now? Told ya th-- 
     
    Apple family  
     
    Pinkie Pie Got it! Best scary unidentifiable creature ever! Say 'terrified'! 
    Apple family  
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Granny Smith Guess that was the scariest cave in Equestria. Uh, of course I meant to take us through it! Unexpected adventure is good for the soul! 
    Pinkie Pie Best granny wisdom ever! 
    Applejack Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out. 
    Granny Smith Huh! Is that how I taught you to treat your elder ponies? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Ooh! Is it? 
    Applejack You taught me to trust my common sense. And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece. 
    Granny Smith And that is exactly what I'm gonna do! 
    Applejack That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day. 
    Granny Smith And how exactly are you gonna know which way to go? 
    Pinkie Pie Hmmmmmmm? 
    Applejack It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard! 
    Apple Bloom Hey! There wouldn't have been an overboard if Big Mac hadn't overpacked the jalopy! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyu- hey! 
    Applejack Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'. 
    Apple family  
     
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down! 
     
     
    Apple family  

    Apple family  
    Pinkie Pie Wheeeee! 
     
     
    Granny Smith Huh! Told you that sugar pine sap would hold this thing together. 
     
    Apple family  
     
    Pinkie Pie  

    Apple family  
    Pinkie Pie We're here! We're here! We made it to Goldie Delicious's's's's's! You guys! There's a note!  
    Applejack Uh, Pinkie Pie? Maybe you could read that one out loud? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is. Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon! Oh, that's perfect! 
    Apple Bloom Why is that perfect? 
    Pinkie Pie Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper! See ya! 
    Apple Bloom Worst family road trip. Ever. 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup. 
    Applejack I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this.  I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft. It's like I wasn't myself at all. 
    Granny Smith Aw, that wasn't your fault. My stubborn streak got a hold of me somethin' fierce. Should've let you take the wheel long a'fore that. 
    Apple Bloom It was my fault the map got all wet... 
    Big McIntosh I was the pony whoâ€” 
    Granny Smith Now, now, Big Mac, you gotta know we forgive you for packin' the jalopy so much that it collapsed. You was just as eager to please Pinkie Pie like the rest of us. 
    Applejack Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one. 
    Granny Smith Sure as applesauce. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you kidding me?! You guys are the best family ever! 
    Applejack How can you say that? We started out as one big unit, and now look at us. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! Now look at you! You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong! You never gave up, even when things got tough! 
    Apple Bloom She does make a pretty good point. 
    Pinkie Pie You aren't just family, you're best friends! And I wanna be an Apple more than ever! 
    Apple Bloom And we want you to be one too! 
    Pinkie Pie Yippee!  
    Goldie Delicious Now that's how you run an errand. 
    Pinkie Pie Hello! 
    Goldie Delicious Hello yourself! 
    Applejack You must be Goldie Delicious. So nice to meet you. 
    Goldie Delicious Uh-huh. And who exactly are you? 
    Pinkie Pie We're Apples! 
    Applejack Well, we think we're all Apples. But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed. 
    Goldie Delicious Well why didn't you say so? If anypony can help solve this genealogy mystery, it's me! 
     
    Goldie Delicious  
     
    Goldie Delicious Gotta... get some oil... for the hinges... Alrighty then, just have to move a few things out of the way of the door. Ooh! Ah! Get off of that, Mr. Fluffy... Come on, Pooples... Come here, sweetheart... Come on in! Sorry about the mess! 
     
    Applejack Whoa! 
    Goldie Delicious Oh, careful now. Those belonged to your great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart! 
    Apple Bloom Well, whose was this? 
    Goldie Delicious Well, that was my lunch. A couple of weeks ago. 
     
    Goldie Delicious  This here is a complete record of, of our family tree! It's not here, or here, or, or here, or it certainly isn't here, is it...? Oh, here it is! ...Oh, dear. 
    Granny Smith 'Oh, dear'? What is it? 
    Pinkie Pie Am I not an Apple after all? 
    Goldie Delicious Well, that's just it. I don't know. The page is all smudged. I sure am sorry, but I don't think I can help you out after all. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family. 
    Applejack Well, I know for sure! 
    Pinkie Pie What do you mean? You can't know! 
    Applejack I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say. After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core! 
    Granny Smith Darn tootin'! 
    Apple Bloom Yes siree! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Say 'best family hug ever'! 
    Apple family Best family hug ever! 
     

    Applejack Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie! We'll see you soon! 
    Goldie Delicious Y'all sure you don't want to take any of these Apple family heirlooms home with you? 
     
     
    Big McIntosh Nnope. 

    

        We're Apples forever, Apples together 
        We're family, but so much more 
        No matter what comes, we will face the weather 
        We're Apples to the core! 

    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 

    Applejack Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes. 
    Apple Bloom Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom You know what? Maybe I should write it. I'm good at makin' things sound excitin'. 
    Granny Smith I have a history of excellent storytellin'. I should probably do itâ€” Hey! Where in the haystack do you think you're goin' with that there pen?! 
    Big McIntosh I'm goin' to do-  
    Apple family  
    Pinkie Pie  

     

Rainbow Falls

    Rainbow Dash Alright, ponies, listen up! 
    Fluttershy We're all ears. Right, Bulk Biceps? 
    Bulk Biceps  Nuh-uh! I'm all muscles! Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!s to get us to the Equestria Games! We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts. And do I need to remind you how much I - I mean, Ponyville, heh â€“ wants to qualify and make it to the Games? 
    Fluttershy I remember. I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville. 
    Bulk Biceps Bring it on! 
    Pinkie Pie Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'! 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie  P, Ponyville! 
    Bulk Biceps P! 
    Fluttershy Oh, thanks, Pinkie Pie. That was a scary- I mean, great cheer.  
    Rainbow Dash Just make sure you have one ready for when we qualify for the Aerial Relay. 
    Bulk Biceps And after that, for when we win gold medals in the Equestria Games! 
    Applejack Not so fast! If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya. They're perfect. 
    Pinkie Pie 'P' is for 'perfect'! 
    Bulk Biceps and Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Alright, team! Show me what you got! Put some bend into those knees! Flap those wings! And I want to see all four hooves off the ground on the count of three!  One two three! 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Rainbow Dash Don't forget to breathe while you're up there! 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Fluttershy  
     
    Pinkie Pie 'P' is for, uhh... 'pain'? 
    Rainbow Dash  

     

     
    Helia Good luck, Rainbow Dash! Sorry we couldn't fly with you on the Aerial Relay, but the air sprinters needed us too. 
    Thunderlane Too bad we can only compete in one event.  But, rules are rules. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good luck!  It was nice of you to be part of the team that doesn't have... uh... the strongest flyers. 
    Rainbow Dash Nothing nice about it. I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony. With me on the team, we'll qualify. I'm sure of it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ponyville is very lucky to have you. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I'm pretty awesome. 
    Fluttershy  Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games. I just hope I don't let anypony down. 
    Bulk Biceps We'll make them proud! 
    Pinkie Pie 'P' is for 'proud'! We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen! 
    Rarity Ooh. Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games. 
    Applejack And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys. 
    Pinkie Pie I can't wait! 
     

    Ponies  
    Mane Moon There's Rainbow Dash! She's an awesome flyer! 
    Orange Swirl I heard that she's flying the last third of the relay, which means everypony else is gonna have to be way ahead to beat her! 
     
    Mane Moon Oh, the Wonderbolts! 
    Sprinkle Medley I hear they're flying for Cloudsdale. 
    Orange Swirl Then Cloudsdale will definitely qualify. They're the best flyers ever. 
    Spitfire And the game is on! 
    Soarin Hah, nice to see there's some real competition here! 
    Fleetfoot Two more days of practice, then we'll see you in the air, Rainbow Dash! If you're lucky. 
    Rainbow Dash  The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice! Right team? 
    Fluttershy Right. 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
    Pinkie Pie Hooray!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle And, um, I'm with her! Hooray! 
    Cloudsdale cheerleaders Give us some clouds! Give us some dale! And what do you get? Cloudsdale! Woo-hoo! 
    Pinkie Pie  Where can I get pompoms like those?! 

    Rainbow Dash So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here? 
    Bulk Biceps Uh, maybe? 
    Rainbow Dash We want to qualify! We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line! Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it! 
    Bulk Biceps  
     
    Rainbow Dash What the? 
    Applejack Sorry! Got the idea from them, but... 
    Rainbowshine and Sprinkle Medley Hooves down! Cakes up! 
    Fleetfoot and Spitfire  
    Applejack ...It looks like they got better aim. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless. You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude! And whatever you do, don't let go of it! 
    Fluttershy Are you really, really, really sure you're ready? I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure. 
    Bulk Biceps Ready! 
     
    Rarity Ponyville could do so much better. I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time! 
    Rainbow Dash We were using that! And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  I guess some ponies do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Some ponies do what? 
    Rainbow Dash  Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others. 

    Rainbow Dash Watch and learn. The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are. And my personal heroes. So, maybe you can learn something. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Please learn something? 
    Fleetfoot C'mon, Soarin, pick up the pace! You can do better than that! 
    Spitfire I sure hope so. 
    Cloudsdale cheerleaders Practice, practice, yay, practice! 
    Soarin Whoa! 
     
    Soarin Whooaaaa! 

    Soarin Aaaaah! Help! 
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! 
    Wonderbolts and Ponyville team  
    Fleetfoot Awe-some! 
    Spitfire As good as any Wonderbolt! 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you. You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay. At least, I hope he's okay.  Are you okay? 
    Soarin Uh, my wing hurts, but I-I'm sure it'll be okay by the competition. 
     
    Soarin You're the best, Rainbow Dash.  
    Rainbow Dash Ah, it was nothin'. But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you! 
     
    Bulk Biceps 'P' is for Rainbow Dash! 
    Fluttershy  Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'. 
    Bulk Biceps Never mind! 
    Rainbow Dash Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts. 
    Fleetfoot You know, you grew up in Cloudsdale. 
    Spitfire So that means you could fly with us. 
    Rainbow Dash Fly? 
    Fleetfoot Uh, we mean practice. You could practice with us until Soarin's better. 
    Spitfire What do you say? Wanna be our third? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I don't know. My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify. Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around. 
    Spitfire We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the Wonderbolt Academy and you handled those just fine. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy... but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition. 
    Fleetfoot Who says they need to know? Think about it, Rainbow Dash! This is your chance to fly with the winners! 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Rainbow Dash Alright, I'll do it. 
    Spitfire  Wise decision, Rainbow Dash. 

     
     
    Fleetfoot Awesome! 
    Cloudsdale cheerleaders Whinny, ponies, whinny! Fly on, fly on, fly on! 

    Bulk Biceps  
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it! 
     
    Fluttershy Um... I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to. 
     
    Bulk Biceps and Fluttershy  
     
    Rainbow Dash Nnnngh... 

     
     

    Fluttershy  Oof! 
    Rainbow Dash You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups. I'm just gonna get some, uh, water. 

     

    Fluttershy  
    Bulk Biceps  
    Applejack and Fluttershy  

     
     
     
     

    Bulk Biceps  Yeah! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity Too much? 

     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle It's not easy practicing with two teams, is it? 
    Rainbow Dash  You... know? Does anypony else? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. They're too busy practicing to wonder why you keep disappearing. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify. I can fly fast enough to make up the distance. 
    Twilight Sparkle It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one. 
    Rainbow Dash But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify. 
    Spitfire Rainbow Dash, you got a minute? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, sure. 
    Fleetfoot You could really be an asset to our team, so... we want you to join the Cloudsdale team. Permanently. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Spitfire It looks like Soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us. 
    Fleetfoot Of course, this means you won't be able to fly for Ponyville, but let's face it. Even with you on their team, their chances of qualifying for the Games- 
    Bulk Biceps Ow! 
    Fleetfoot -are pretty slim. 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Spitfire So, what's it gonna be? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I... 
    Spitfire Take some time to think about it. 
    Rainbow Dash They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true! 
    Twilight Sparkle If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think this is a decision you have to make on your own. The race is tomorrow, so you'd better make it soon. 

     
    Rainbow Dash  Woe is me! Oooh! 
    Crowd  
    Fluttershy What's happened? 
    Rainbow Dash Urgh, I've hurt my hoof... 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity  
    Spitfire All of them? 
    Rainbow Dash I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a...  pokey stick coming out of the ground... 
    Pinkie Pie , it'll be in big trouble! 
    Rainbow Dash There is no way I can fly now. 
    Fluttershy Do you think you'll be better by tryouts? 
    Rainbow Dash  I just need a little rest. 
    Fluttershy Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We'll take care of you... or, at least, somepony will. Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle So, the medic pony isn't sure what's wrong with you. 
    Rainbow Dash Everything! Absolutely everything! 
    Applejack This'll cure everythin' that ails ya! 
    Rainbow Dash  Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage? 
    Rainbow Dash That might help. 
     
    Fluttershy And how is our patient doing? 
     
    Bulk Biceps  
    Rainbow Dash I've been better. 
    Fluttershy We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts. We'll be alright. We even have a replacement. We're so, so sorry that you can't compete. We all know how much you love to fly. And we promise- 
    Bulk Biceps Cross our hearts! 
    Fluttershy ...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you. 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks... 
    Twilight Sparkle  I think Rainbow Dash might need to rest some more. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Applejack Don't forget your bettys! 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision. 
    Soarin You sure have nice friends. Nopony's been by to visit me. Eh, too busy practicing, I guess. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon. 
    Soarin Oh, it's fine. I-I'm just keeping it warm in case my team wants me back. 
    Rainbow Dash What do you mean, 'wants you back'? Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly! 
    Soarin And they told me that they were worried I wouldn't be one hundred percent by the tryouts, so they were going with somepony else! 
    Rainbow Dash That somepony else was me! Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is. 
    Soarin So,  I guess we're all out of luck. Cloudsdale won't qualify without three fliers, and Ponyville won't qualify without you. Too bad... 

    Twilight Sparkle Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense. 
    Pinkie Pie Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?! 
    Applejack Uh, what were you gonna do with them before? 
    Rarity  Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Is that Rainbow Dash... walking? 
    Spitfire  
    Fleetfoot Does... this mean you're feeling better? 
    Rainbow Dash I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place. 
    Wonderbolts  
    Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy and Derpy  
    Rainbow Dash I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard! 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will. 
    Rainbow Dash I know now who I should've been loyal to. 
    Spitfire Good choice. Always stick with the winners. 
    Rainbow Dash Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not. 
    Rest of main cast and Derpy  
    Spitfire Are you sure that's the right decision? 
    Rainbow Dash You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer! You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of. 
    Spitfire Huh. Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you. 
    Fleetfoot Think we already have. 
    Spitfire Ready to fly? 
    Soarin Really? 
    Spitfire Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with. 
    Soarin  Go, Cloudsdale! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Ponyville relay team! We've got a race to get ready for! 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 

     
    Soarin Come on, Ponyville! You can do it! 
     
     
     
     
    Bulk Biceps  
    Twilight Sparkle Go, Fluttershy! Woo-hoo! 
    Cloudsdale cheerleaders Qualify, Ponyville! Qualify, Ponyville! 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! Go, Rainbow Dash! 
    Applejack  
    Official Ponyville qualifies! 
     

     
     
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
    Main cast sans Rainbow Dash Yeah! 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle Equestria Games, here we come! 
     

    Rainbow Dash Oh, I can't deny it. I love to win! But if I ever gotta choose between winning and being loyal to my friends, I'm always gonna choose my friends. 'Cause as much as I love winning, I love them waaaaay more. 

     

Three's A Crowd

     
     
    Spike Mail's here! 
    Twilight Sparkle Please be a yes, please be a yes, please be a yes... Yes! She can make it, she can make it! 
    Spike Going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that Princess Cadance said she can come this weekend! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister-in-law! This is the best news ever! 
     
    Fluttershy Um, so sorry for barging in like this... but I'm so excited, I just couldn't wait to tell somepony! The Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures have given me permission to observe the rarest, tiniest, most adorable magical creatures in all of Equestria â€“ the Breezies! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Fluttershy, that's fantastic! 
    Fluttershy Oh, it's not just fantastic; it just might be the best news ever! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I just got the most incredible mail anypony's ever received in all of recorded pony postal history! It's a flyer about a one-day sale on used patio furniture! Aah! Could this day get any better? Woo-hoo! 

     

     
    Rarity Here's a wrap, in case it gets cold. 
    Applejack And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry. 
    Twilight Sparkle Have a great time! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I will. And I hope you have fun with Cadance. 
     
    Conductor All aboard! 
     
     
    Fluttershy Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony! 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy! I'll never forget youuuuuuu!  Ooh, something floaty! La-la-la-la-la! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit! 
    Applejack What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, why wouldn't it? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been worry-free. 
    Rarity The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together. 
    Applejack I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way. 
    Twilight Sparkle The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts! 
    Rarity Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert it's this one! 
    Rainbow Dash  Uh, sorry. Something in my throat... like a big ball of 'lame'! 
    Rarity I think it sounds delightful. 
    Applejack Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. Just quiet time. 
     
     
     
    Princess Cadance Your Highness. 
    Twilight Sparkle Your Highness. 
    Princess Cadance I'm teasing, Twilight. We're sisters-in-law. We don't have to be so formal. 
     
     
    Princess Cadance Knowing you, you've made some plans. 
    Twilight Sparkle Boy, have I. Hang on just one second.  You guys- 
    Rarity Now, now, don't you worry about a thing! We will make sure that nothing â€“ but nothing â€“ interferes with your visit. 
    Applejack Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk. 
    Twilight Sparkle You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance! 
    Pinkie Pie  Two sisters-in-law bonding. Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day! 
     
    Applejack What is that thing? 
    Rarity Whatever it is... duuuck!!! 
    Pinkie Pie Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What is that? 
    Discord  No, not a "what", but a "who", dear. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, no... That sounds like... 
    Discord  Oh... 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity Discord! 

    Applejack What in tarnation are you doin' here? And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue? 
    Rarity More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise. 
    Rainbow Dash Whatever color you are is the color of trouble! 
    Discord Oh, Rainbow Dash, I've changed, surely you remember? I was reformed by lovely little-  
    Applejack What are you, sick or somethin'? 
    Discord Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch? 
     
    Rarity What? 
    Discord How charming, thank you. I can't stop sneezing and wheezing. In short... I need help.  
    Rainbow Dash If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness? 
    Discord  Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon. 
     
    Discord I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need- 
    Rainbow Dash You need to chill. Fluttershy's out. 
    Discord Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today. 
    Applejack How do you know about her trip? 
    Discord Well, she told me about it in her last letter. 
    Pinkie Pie You and Fluttershy write each other letters? 
    Discord Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do. 
    Rainbow Dash Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something... 
    Discord Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other?  Let the healing begin! 
    Rainbow Dash Not it! 
    Discord Well, that's some way to treat a suffering friend.  
    Pinkie Pie Don't you worry, Discord! I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me! I was born on a Tuesday- 
    Discord Oh, you're so sweet to offer, but Rarity and Applejack already volunteered to be my own personal nursemaids.  
    Applejack and Rarity We did? 
    Discord I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey! Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons? 
    Applejack  That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible. 
     
    Rarity  You're right. We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit... although I do so wish that "anything" had turned out to be something else! 
    Discord Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight? 
    Applejack Maybe. 
    Discord Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited? 
    Applejack They're plenty close. 
    Discord And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless... 
    Rarity Don't even think about it! They mustn't be disturbed! 
    Discord Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly-  contagious. 
    Applejack and Rarity  
     
    Discord Oh no, I've gotten you both sick. Whomever shall I turn to now in my time of need?  

    Twilight Sparkle A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better? 
    Princess Cadance Absolutely nothing.  Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of Maretania? 
    Twilight Sparkle It sure is! 
    Princess Cadance Oh, I can't believe I'm getting to see it in real life! 
     
    Princess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle  
    Discord  
    Twilight Sparkle Discord! What are you doing here?! 
    Discord Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick.  Blue flu. 
    Princess Cadance Blue flu? 
    Discord Ah, I fear I've already given it to poor Applejack and Rarity.  
    Princess Cadance Magic health bubble. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good thinking. 
    Discord Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that... 
    Discord But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend. 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, that is not what I'm saying. 
    Discord Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Guess we don't have much choice. 
    Discord Carry me? 
    Princess Cadance It isn't far. I think you can manage. 
    Discord Oh, poo. 

    Twilight Sparkle Need anything else? 
    Discord Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance It's going to be fine. We'll just get him what he wants and be back to the exhibit in no time. What was it that you needed? 

    

        A little glass of water please 
        A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze 
        Some tea with honey from the bees 
        Whenever you can brew it 

    Princess Cadance I'll get your tea. 

    

        And while I get a little rest 
        A teeny tiny small request 
        Some codfish oil for my chest 
        Poured from a crystal cruet 

    Twilight Sparkle A crystal cruet? 

    

         
        My goodness, I'm a nincompoop 
        Because I fear I've got the croup 
        I need a vat of pumpkin soup 
        And scarves made out of zinnias 

        Did I say zinnias? I meant silk 
        Or something shiny of that ilk 
        And then I'll need some nice warm milk 
        And pastries from Abyssinia 

        And since my stomach's feeling crummy 
        Why not give my aching tummy 
        Something soothing, something yummy 
        Piled up with noodles? 

        Add a slice of homemade rye 
        With stacks of Swiss way up high 
        Served with sides of sweet mince pie 
        More basil; I need oodles! 

    Twilight Sparkle Anything else? 

    

        I'll be grateful for your charity 
        Until the bitter end 
        Because I've heard that tenderness 
        Is what you lend an ailing friend 

    Tenderness, isn't that right, friend? 

    Twilight Sparkle Right, butâ€” 
    Discord So, who's ready for my big reprise? 

        I'd like that glass of water please 
        Some magic spell to cure disease 
        A firm "gesundhoof" when I sneeze 
        A fresh bouquet of roses 

        Some lozenges will soon appease 
        My wheezing when I start to sneeze 
        A wig to keep me from the breeze 
        And blankets for my toes-es 

        Take tweezers out of my valise 
        And then massage my knobby knees 
        A bowl of peas, some extra cheese 
        A cuddle with a Pekingese 
        A singing harp who's named Louise 
        A goat on skis, a new trapeze 
        And more and more and more and more of these 

    And just because I oughta... 

        Make sure I'm drinking in the right 
        Amount of fluids day and night 
        I wish I may, I wish I might 
        Have just one little thing 
        Oh, would you please finally bring 
        Me that tiny glass 
        Of water?!! 

     
     
    Discord Oops. Sorry.  
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, this is ridiculous! 
    Princess Cadance How did you even catch this flu? 
    Discord Inadequate hoof and claw washing? 
    Twilight Sparkle There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books! 
    Discord There is one way... 
    Princess Cadance And you didn't think to mention it earlier? 
    Discord Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu. 
    Twilight Sparkle I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick? 
    Discord Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower. 
    Twilight Sparkle So where exactly are Cadance and I headed? 
    Discord Well,  you'll want to head north, turn left, thâ€” Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself. 
    Princess Cadance I thought you were in no condition to travel. 
    Discord I'm not. We'll need to make some arrangements.  

    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle Doing okay there? 
    Princess Cadance To be honest, I'm a little out of practice when it comes to flying. 
    Discord Well, then lucky for you. We're here. 
     
    Discord It's just at the top of that hill. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together. 
    Princess Cadance I know, I was looking forward to it too. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together. 
     
    Princess Cadance One... last... pull! 
    Princess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved- 
    Princess Cadance What in Equestria?! 
    Tatzlwurm  
    Princess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle  
    Tatzlwurm  
    Princess Cadance Twilight! Help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Get your coils off my sister-in-law! 
     
    Tatzlwurm  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance Let go of my sister-in-law! 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks! 
    Princess Cadance Don't thank me yet! 
    Tatzlwurm  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Just... a little... more! 
    Tatzlwurm  
    Princess Cadance And for good measure...! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Are you okay? 
    Princess Cadance  Yes. Better than okay actually. 
    Twilight Sparkle Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together. 

    Discord To the ends of Equestria! To face such great danger! And she did it for me! She did it all for me, for me, for me!  
    Twilight Sparkle You... were... faking?! 
    Discord I was! But I had a very good reason. 
    Twilight Sparkle We're listening. 
    Discord Well, I was in my thinking tree â€“ that's where I do most of my really deep thinking â€“ I was there, and I said to myself, I said, "Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit." 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't even know where you li- 
    Discord "Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you." 
    Twilight Sparkle I have never considered myself t- 
    Discord But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not more- 
    Discord By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test! 
     
    Discord Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship? 
    Princess Cadance You didn't put a damper on our visit at all. 

    Twilight Sparkle 
    He didn't?! 

    

    Discord 
    I didn't?! 

    Princess Cadance Spending the day at the Star Swirl the Bearded exhibit would've been more relaxing, but to be honest, relaxation is the last thing I need. 
    Twilight Sparkle It is? 
    Princess Cadance Don't get me wrong. Life in the Crystal Empire is wonderful, but it's become a little... predictable. I enjoy a little excitement now and then. Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord. 
    Discord Yes, she's a real sweetheart. We're all so lucky to have her in our lives. 
     
    Tatzlwurm  
    Discord What in the world?! 
    Tatzlwurm  
     

    Twilight Sparkle I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord? 
    Discord  Yes, Twilight. 
    Applejack I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved... 
    Rarity Well, I have no trouble saying it. You got what you deserved! 
    Fluttershy Now, now, he's learned his lesson. Isn't that right, my little patient? 
    Discord I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing? 
    Twilight Sparkle No! 
    Discord What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water. 

     

Pinkie Pride

     
    Cheese Sandwich Well, Boneless. Looks like our work here is done. 
     
    Cheese Sandwich Yep, those ponies never partied so hard. Thanks to me Cheese. Cheese Sandwich. 
     
    Cheese Sandwich Woo-hoo-hoo! That was a doozy! Well, Boneless. Looks like our next party is gonna be in... Ponyville. 

     

    

        Every single day there's something new you can plan for 
        Every single day there's something wonderful to do 
        But nothing makes me happy like a day that I can say 
        "Today I planned a party, and it's just for you!" 

    Vendor Pony How's it going today, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie Great, thanks! Got any streamers today? 
    Vendor Pony  You betcha! Big party planned? 
    Pinkie Pie Don't you know it! 

    

        Don't have much time to gather all the things I need 
        If I'm really gonna make this party fly 
        For today's another day that all of Ponyville will say 

    

        There goes the super party pony Pinkie Pie! 

    

        She planned our first foal shower where we played all sorts of games 
        Having so much fun as we chose Pound and Pumpkin's names 

    

        She planned my cute-ceaÃ±era my dad made me, I won't lie 
        I demanded all the best, I suppose she passed the test 
        Sure it was pretty good all thanks to Pinkie Pie 

    Pinkie Pie Thanks, I guess? 
    Art Vendor What color paints do you need? 
    Pinkie Pie I'm gonna need the full rainbow! 
    Art Vendor A paintbrush too? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, if you please! 
    Peachy Pitt And what from me? 
    Pinkie Pie Your biggest banner! This party's gonna be the best! 
    Peachy Pitt Haha I don't doubt it! 

    

        Every single day there's something new we can plan for 
        Every single day there's something wonderful to try 
        But nothing makes us happy like a day that we can say 
        "Today there'll be a party planned by Pinkie Pie!" 

    Rarity I don't know how she does it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, look at her go! 
    Applejack Oh, boy! This is gonna be good! 
    Fluttershy Go, Pinkie, go! 

    

        There's no other pony like her, no pony that could be 
        As great! (As great!) As fun! (As fun!) 
        As our super party pony Pinkie! 

    Pinkie Pie Ooh, I am so, so, SO excited because today I'm planning the birthday bash of... Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie You realize that, by enlisting me as your party planner, I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in Ponyville? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh...yeah? I guess. 
    Pinkie Pie No guesses! Parties are no picnic. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I like a nice picnic party. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Oh! 
    Pinkie Pie Parties. Are. Serious! And you have my certified Pinkie Party Promise that you will have the best birthday party ever! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay. 
    Pinkie Pie Great! Now, who's ready to join this super duper party pony to plan this super duper pa-rty? 
    Cheese Sandwich I am. 
     
    Cheese Sandwich  
    Pinkie Pie Who are you, stranger? 
    Cheese Sandwich Name's Cheese Sandwich. I plan parties. 
    Pinkie Pie What an amazing coincidence! I'm Pinkie Pie, and I'm planning a party! 
    Cheese Sandwich Oh, it's no coincidence, my little pony. My cheesy sense was a-tingling, telling me a party was in the works. 
    Pinkie Pie A cheesy sense? Ah! Double amazing! I have a Pinkie Sense! 
    Cheese Sandwich Yes. I sensed you did. And I happen to be the premiere party planner in all of Equestria. If there's a party in need, there I'll be. Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny, or shindig, I'm your pony. 
    Pinkie Pie A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?! What can be more perfect?! 
    Rainbow Dash I'll tell you what -- making this party epic! 'Cause this isn't just any birthday. It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville! 
    Rarity Good heavens, Rainbow Dash. It's your "birth-iversary"! 
    Rainbow Dash Exactly! So what do you say, party planners? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, I think we can do it! 
    Cheese Sandwich Oh, I don't think so. 
    Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie  
    Cheese Sandwich I know so! After all... 

    

        The super-duper party ponyâ€“that pony is me 
        I always knew that was the kind of pony I would be 

    Pinkie Pie Me too! 
    Cheese Sandwich Come on, ponies! Who here likes to party? Ha-ha! You do! I can tell! 

        When I was but a little colt, I just wanted to play 

    Pinkie Pie Like me! 

    

        But everypony told me, "Cheese, that fun just wastes the day" 

    Pinkie Pie As if! 

    

        But when I threw a party and I busted out some moves 

    Pinkie Pie Uh-huh! 

    

        The ponies finally saw the light and got into the groove 

    Pinkie Pie You know it! 

    

        The super-duper party ponyâ€“that pony is me 

    Pinkie Pie And me! 

    

        You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese! 

    Pinkie Pie Uh, Pinkie? 
    Cheese Sandwich Hey, good-lookin', want some mayonnaise? 

        My parties are all off the hook 
        I never plan them by the book 
        I start out fun, then whoopsie-daisy 
        Everybody just gets crazy! 

        Bored of snacks made by your mom? 
        How about a giant party bomb? 
        Huge piÃ±atas filled with cake 
        Or dive into my fruit punch lake! 

    Goldengrape Geronimo! 

    

        The super-duper party ponyâ€“that pony is me 
        You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese 

    C'mon, kid, take it for a spin! 
    Colt Golly! Thanks, mister! 

    

        Oh, when I throw a Cheese party, be sure to not be lame 
        And miss my pie fights, wacky kites, and streamers in your mane 
        Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts, and brie fondue delight 
        You know that with Cheese Sandwich, you'll be partying all night! 

    Rainbow Dash C'mon, everypony! Let's party down with Cheese! 
    Fluttershy You're really a certified party pony? 
    Cheese Sandwich That's right! That's my guarantee! 

        The super-duper party ponyâ€“that pony is me-e-e-e-e 

    

        But what about the super party pony named Pinkie...? 

    Cheese Sandwich  Thanks buddy! You're gonna love this party! Hey kid, have a streamer, on me! 

    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Hah, now that's what I'm talking about! I'm so stoked you're here, Cheese Sandwich! 
    Applejack Yeah. You sure did come on the right day. 
    Rarity  Your party sounds simply divine. 
    Twilight Sparkle We're so lucky to have you here. 
    Cheese Sandwich Just doing my job, little fillies. 
    Rainbow Dash I mean, Pinkie Pie's parties are fun and sweet and all, but now this party's gonna be-- 
    Cheese Sandwich Epic? 
    Rainbow Dash You said it! Oh, yeah! 
    Cheese Sandwich Feels gouda! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, heh, no offense, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, n-none taken.  

    Rainbow Dash My birth-iversary's already looking way cooler! You are my kind of party pony, Cheese Sandwich. 
    Cheese Sandwich  You got that right, Rainbow Dash. All right, party ponies, I've got some planning to do! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! Aren't you gonna help Cheese Sandwich plan the party? 
    Pinkie Pie That's okay.  He obviously has what it takes to do it all by himself. Heh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, indeedy!  After all, if Cheese really is the super duperiest partying-est pony of them all, maybe that means... I'm... not. 

    

        For all my life, all I've wanted to do 
        Was make my friends want to smile true 
        But maybe I was wrong 
        And Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all 

        I'll try to get up on my hooves 
        And try a different task 
        I'll find something new to do 
        There's gotta be more to me than planning a party or two 

        I put away my party cannon, I deflated all my balloons 
        The bubbles all burst, now what is next for you? 
        For you... 

    Oh, I remember this one my first party ever. My whole family was there. And that's Twilight's welcome-to-Ponyville party. She didn't even expect that one.  Oh, look at Gummy! He just looks so excited for this birthday party! Hmm. Shining Armor and Cadance's wedding sure was special, especially once I got a hold of the music. 

        Oh, look at those happy faces 
        All the parties that I had thrown 
        I made them laugh, had such a blast 
        A smile that's all their own 
        They loved seeing me, the real Pinkie 
        Show them the time of their life like they've never known 
        Like they've never kno-o-own 

        I've got to get back out there, have to show them that I've tried 
        For there's only one great party pony -- that is Pinkie Pie 
        Won't let Cheese Sandwich beat me, won't let him get me down 
        For I am Pinkie, the bestest party pony around! 

    Rarity I must say I marvel at your superior party planning expertise, Cheese Sandwich.  
    Applejack Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'. 
    Pinkie Pie That's it! This pony has gotta get her title back! And I know just what to do! 

    Rainbow Dash Totally awesome! 
    Applejack Huh. Best I've ever seen. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe it! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Freeze, Cheese! I challenge you... to a goof off! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! Not a goof off! 
    Applejack  What's a goof off? 
    Fluttershy I have no idea, hehe. 
    Cheese Sandwich This Cheese has stood alone a long time, Pinkie Pie. You think you can out-goof me? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, I don't think so. I know so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash! 
    Twilight Sparkle And the loser? 
    Pinkie Pie Doesn't! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie So, are you in, Cheese? Or are you... boneless? 
    Cheese Sandwich Nopony calls me boneless. Right, Boneless? 
    Pinkie Pie Then the goof off is on for high noon! 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, Pinkie? It's already 3 o'clock. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. Oh, well then. Make it 310 to goof off! 

     
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle All right, everypony. According to my official goof off rulebook... 
    Rainbow Dash She actually has a goof off rulebook? 
    Spike Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything! 
    Matilda Shhh. 
    Twilight Sparkle The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, you are the judge. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better? 
    Twilight Sparkle Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready? 
    Pinkie Pie I was born ready! 
    Cheese Sandwich I was ready before I was born! 
    Twilight Sparkle Then... Let the goofing begin! 
     

    

        It's your birthday party, a very special day 
        I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say 
        Happy, happy, happy, happy 
        Happy, happy, happy, happy 
        Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you! 

    

        If you wanna be the life of the party 
        But you're feeling just a little uptight 
        Call the doctor, beg and plead 
        "Doctor, tell me what I need" 
        Try to put a little cheese in your knees! 

    

        Bubbles and balloons, bubbles and balloons 
        What's a birthday party without bubbles and balloons? 
        Star-shaped or trapezoid, look what I can do 
        Only Pinkie Pie can make a bubble shaped like you! 

    

        Just let yourself go floppy, for now this is your chance 
        Pretend you have no bones and do the rubber chicken dance! 

    Hit it, Boneless! 

    

        Cooler than a rubber chicken and tastier than cake 
        Come on, you, let's party down and do the Gummy shake! 

    Hit it, Gummy! Uh-huh! You know it! Shake it! 

    

        'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile 
        Yes I do 
        It fills my heart with sunshine all the while 
        Yes it does 
        'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile 
        From these happy friends of mine 

    Pinkie Pie That's my song! 
    Cheese Sandwich What do you mean? I have no idea what you're talking about. 
    Pinkie Pie THAT'S IT! 

    

        Roll out the party cannon 
        When you hear the party cannon song 
        Ka-BOOM! 

    

        Why should you compromise? Try this one on for size 
        'Cause nothing quite says cheer like the ringing in your ear 
        Of the cheese supreme cannonball surprise! 

    

        Â¡Dale, dale, dale 
        No pierdas el tino! 
        Porque si lo pierdes 
        Â¡Pierdes el camino! 

    Pinkie Pie  Rainbow's not having the best party ever! I... I broke the Pinkie Party Promise! Stop! The goof off is off! 
     
    Rainbow Dash But I haven't named a winner. 
    Pinkie Pie You don't have to. I forfeit. Which means... Cheese Sandwich wins. 
    Cheese Sandwich  ...I do? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes. You get to headline Rainbow Dash's party. 
    Twilight Sparkle But, what about you, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie I...  I don't. 

    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, wait! I'm sorry I got all swept away by Cheese Sandwich. 
    Twilight Sparkle We all are. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Spike  Sorry, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie No. I'm sorry I let my pride get in the way of you having the best birth-iversary ever. Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner. I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day. 
    Rainbow Dash But don't you get it? You're both super duper party ponies. Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony. Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you. 
    Cheese Sandwich Rainbow Dash is right. I never meant to take your place in Ponyville. I just wanted to show you what a great party pony I am, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Why me? 
    Cheese Sandwich Well... 

    

        I fear I told a little fib about my pony past 
        I hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast 
        I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed 
        The fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name 

        I stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance 
        And found the biggest ever celebration party dance 
        Everything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place 
        And I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face 

        I vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free 
        For now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee 
        A super duper party pony -- that's what I became 
        I traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name 

        But that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why 
        For the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie 

    Pinkie Pie Me? 
    Cheese Sandwich Yes! 
    Pinkie Pie Hah, really?! 
    Cheese Sandwich Really! 
    Pinkie Pie So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower? 
    Cheese Sandwich Swear on Camembert! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two. It's my birth-iversary, and you gotta throw me a bash! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! 
    Cheese Sandwich Let's go! 

    

        Super duper party ponies -- that is me and you 
        A party thrown by one is good, but not as great as two 
        Come on and let's join forces, have twice the expertise 
        Now let's all go to the party planned by Pinkie Pie and Cheese! 

     
    Cheese Sandwich All right, everypony! We are here to celebrate the birthday... 
    Pinkie Pie ...and anniversary... 
    Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich ...of Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, everypony! Who's ready to get their party on?! Hit it! 

    

        Get your hooves up, party's starting out right now 
        Everypony, everypony get down 
        Time to make a wish, better make it right now 
        It's been a year and today is your birthday party 

        Make a wish, it's your birthday 
        Make a wish, it's your birthday party 
        Make a wish, it's your birthday 
        Make a wish, it's your birthday party 

    Rainbow Dash Cheese Sandwich! Oh, I gotta tell ya, you and Pinkie have totally made this the best birthday/anniversary super combo ever! Hah, it's totally-- 
    Cheese Sandwich Epic? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, it is! 
    Cheese Sandwich That's all I needed to hear, little filly. Just a little memento of my visit. 
    Pinkie Pie You're giving me your special rubber chicken friend? 
    Cheese Sandwich Oh, he's not the only one. Well, Boneless Two, another job well done. But it's time we mosey along. Another town, another party. 
    Pinkie Pie I never did get that pony's name. 
    Rest of main cast Cheese Sandwich! 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, yeah! 

     

Simple Ways

    Rainbow Dash Wow! I can't believe how many ponies showed up! 
    Pinkie Pie I can! I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal! 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't know Granny Smith was on the selection committee. 
    Applejack Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is! Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing! So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me. 
    Ponies Shhh! 
     
    Mayor Mare Citizens of Ponyville, this year's applicants were all exceptional, but there can only be one Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies. And that pony is... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Mayor Mare Rarity! 
    Ponies  
    Applejack Whoo-ee! All right, Rarity! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Whoo-oo-oo!  
    Twilight Sparkle Congratulations, Rarity! Do you know what you're gonna do? 
    Spike  
    Rarity Oh, I might have a few ideas. 

     

    Pinkie Pie I'm so excited for the festival, I can hardly stand up straight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Me too. I'm glad Rarity was picked. I know she'll add a touch of elegance to the whole thing! 
    Applejack Probably more than a touch! 
     
     
    Spike  This year's Ponyville Days festival, designed by Rarity, will feature various high-class events such as... a silent cider auction and tasting. 
    Main cast sans Rarity Ooooh! 
    Spike A Ponyville gala in town square. 
    Main cast sans Rarity Ahhhh! 
    Spike And, of course, a Ponyville fashion show. 
    Main cast sans Rarity Ooooh! 
    Spike This year's Ponyville Days festival pony of ceremonies creates shimmering couture of her own design. 
    Rarity And the theme is... "Small Town Chic"! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Rarity. You really have put a lot of effort into this. 
    Applejack I'll say. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I think it's going to be magical. 
    Rarity  Do you really think so? 
    Pinkie Pie Are you kidding? I can't wait! 
    Rarity Oh, that's such a relief. But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own. The festival is in three days! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square! 
    Applejack And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'. 
    Rarity Oh, that's just perfect! And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show... 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! 
    Fluttershy I'd be honored. 
    Rarity I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all. 
    Main cast sans Rarity What? 
    Rarity Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress... Trenderhoof! 
     
    Applejack Uh, who's Trenderhoof? 
    Rarity What?! How can you not know who Trenderhoof is? Trenderhoof is only the most amazing, handsomest travel writer to have ever traveled or written! Before Las Pegasus became an Equestria travel destination, he wrote about it! Before the culinary revolution in Trottingham, he discovered it! He knows what's going to be hot even before it's tepid!  
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush. 
    Rarity Oh, Twilight, "crush" doesn't even begin to describe it. He's practically divine. I can't believe he's coming!  

     
    Rarity Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight. I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's no problem, but you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him. 
     
    Rarity Is that him? Is he here? Twilight, is he there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uhh... I'm not sure. 
    Rarity You don't suppose he's decided not to come? Twilight, I don't see him! What if he doesn't arrive? The whole festival will be a disaster! Twilight, where is he?! 
     
    Rarity  Sorry. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, you have to get a hold of yourself. I mean, you haven't even met him yet! 
     
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle What's wrong? 
    Rarity Shh!  It's him, it's him, is it him? Is it him? It's him, he's here, he's here! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, go up and talk to him! 
    Rarity  
    Trenderhoof Please, call me 'Trend'. 
     

    Rarity And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala! Music, dancing!  And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats. 
    Trenderhoof Reminds me of the "Spring Fling meets Manehattan Wedding" I wrote about in Gallop & Prance. 
    Rarity Exactly! I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me! 

    Rarity And finally, Sweet Apple Acres. Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began. 
    Trenderhoof Oh, breathtaking! I've heard about it of course, but to see it in vÃ©ritÃ©, to stand on the soil of a working farm... You can really feel the authenticity. 
    Rarity Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here. 
    Trenderhoof Thank you, Rarity. Thank you for bringing me here. This farm is truly something special. 
    Rarity Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival... but now I see just how special it is au naturel. 
    Trenderhoof Au naturel indeed. 
     
    Trenderhoof Who... is... that? 
    Applejack  
    Rarity Who? Applejack? Ahem! Why are you staring at her like that? 
    Trenderhoof I've seen a lot in my travels, but I've never beheld such beauty. Applejack... The pony of my dreams... 

    Spike Rarity? Rarity! Hello? 
    Rarity  
    Spike I brought my cider-tasting cup. Are you ready to go try the samples? 
    Rarity  What's the point?! 
    Spike Rarity, what's wrong? 
    Rarity Nothing! 
    Spike Is it something I said? 
    Rarity He doesn't like me. 
    Spike What? 
    Rarity He doesn't like me. 
    Spike Rarity, I can't hear what you'reâ€” 
    Rarity He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair! 
    Spike Trenderhoof doesn't like you? That's ridiculous! 
    Rarity Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else? 
     
    Rarity I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?! 
    Spike I 'unno. 
    Rarity Hmm... 

    Trenderhoof You know, I have such respect for the work ethic of Earth ponies. 
    Applejack Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, "Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away." 
    Trenderhoof How many varieties of apples do you think there are? 
    Applejack Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Causeâ€” 
    Trenderhoof I once had an apple so rare, they thought it was extinct. I ate four of them.  
     
    Applejack Is that a fact? 
    Trenderhoof That's my thing. I take the mundane, the simple, the unappreciated, and I make it relatable. 
    Applejack Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville. 
    Trenderhoof Me too. But enough about me. I wanna know about you! What do apples mean to Applejack? 
    Applejack Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about. 
    Rarity Well, that will never do! 
    Applejack Rarity, what are you wearin'? 
    Rarity What, this old thing? 
    Applejack Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it? 
    Rarity I am. But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself! 
    Applejack Really? 
    Rarity If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples! 
    Trenderhoof  I'm growing fond of it myself. 
    Applejack  Maybe you two should try it sometime. 
    Trenderhoof I'm feeling a tad inspired.

        Without farm life, there'd be such disparity 
        These thoughts I think with great clarity 
        Apples high to the sky 
        She's the one of my eye 
        That fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack! 

    Rarity  
     

    Spike Rarity, why do you want to plow a field? 
    Rarity Is it me, or could this use a splash of color? And maybe a wash! 
    Spike Don't we need to check on the gala decorations? 
    Rarity Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life. If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival. 
    Spike The festival. Right. 
    Rarity And I do appreciate your help ever so much. I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo. 
    Spike Well, that's what friends are for! 
    Rarity Right, so.  Oh, how does Applejack do it? 
    Applejack Well, it would help if the harness was on right! What are you doin'? 
    Rarity I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much. 
    Applejack Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind. 
    Rarity Not at all. Ugh! Oh! 
    Spike She makes it look so easy. 
    Trenderhoof  I know. Isn't she fantastic? 

    Applejack  
    Trenderhoof  
    Rarity I really don't see what the fuss is all about. 
     
    Applejack Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof. 
    Rarity I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much. But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me.  Et voilÃ ! 
    Applejack Well, your way is definitely long on style. 
    Rarity Thank you. 
    Applejack Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside! 
     
    Trenderhoof Rarity, can I ask you something? 
    Rarity Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything. 
    Trenderhoof I've been meaning to ask for a while, and frankly I'm sort of embarrassed. Rarity... do you think... Applejack would be my date for the festival? 
    Rarity Why don't you go ask her yourself?! Hmph! 

     
     
    Applejack Whew! Well, that was close. 
    Rarity If you've come to apologize, there's really no need. 
    Applejack What are you talkin' about? 
    Rarity Let's dispense with the charade, shall we? 
    Applejack Listen, I know you really want Trend to like youâ€” 
    Rarity And he does! Despite somepony's best efforts! 
    Applejack I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me! 
    Rarity Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony. 
    Applejack Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend? 
    Rarity Oh, I'm sure you'd love that. Well, I have a new vision for the festival,  and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together! 

    Fluttershy Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, what's going on? 
    Applejack I'm too scared to guess. 
     
    Rarity  Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme! 
    Spike  
    Rarity  "Simple Ways"! 

    Applejack  
    Rarity  Well? What's so funny? 
    Applejack Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen! 
    Fluttershy It is a little funny. 
    Rarity Fun-nay? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Rarity, you aren't serious, are you? 
    Rarity  Why wouldn't I be? 
    Applejack Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things. 
    Rarity And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much. 
    Applejack But you don't! 
    Rarity How do you know what I like? 
    Applejack Because I know you. 
    Rarity Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank. 
    Applejack And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too? 
    Rarity I don't know what you're gittin' at! 
    Applejack Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you! 
    Rarity Be my guest! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on. 
    Applejack  

    Rarity  Who's our next model for the fashion show? 
    Spike Um... Apple... Jewel? 
    Rarity Who the hay is that? 
     
    Rarity Is this some kind of joke? 
    Applejack  Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking? 
    Rarity  Because you would never wear an ensemble like that. You like plowing fields and hauling applesâ€” 
    Applejack And I can like fashion just as much. 
    Rarity  But you don't! 
    Applejack Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think. 
    Rarity Fine. But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it! 
    Applejack Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista! 
     
    Rarity  
    Applejack Oh, is that so? 
    Rarity Yes, indeedy-doodle! 
    Applejack  Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times. 
    Rarity Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends. 
    Applejack My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them. 
    Rarity My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields! 
    Applejack I'm so fashion-forward. 
    Rarity I wear droopy drawers! 
    Applejack I smell like rosebuds. 
    Rarity I love being covered in mud! 
     
     
    Rarity  Goodness! Your couture! Ooh, it's bad. Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?! 
    Applejack  There's the Rarity I know! 
    Rarity Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things. You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself. I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit. 
    Applejack I kinda know how you feel. 
    Rarity Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being. And you were right.  Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you. I wish I hadn't ruined it. 
    Applejack Thanks! It's nice, ain't it? 
    Rarity It's magnificent! Wherever did you get it? 
    Applejack Oh, it's, uh, one of yours. 
    Rarity I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat! 
    Trenderhoof  I'm moving to Ponyville! Being the most interesting pony in Equestria is exhausting. I want to leave my exotic, exciting life behind and live on a farm! 
    Applejack and Rarity What?! 
    Applejack Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Trenderhoof Oh. 
    Applejack Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh... 
    Rarity I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else. If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss. 
    Trenderhoof Well, this is awkward. 
    Rarity Not at all. In fact, I think I know just how you feel. 
    Applejack What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to "Small Town Chic"? 
    Rarity Not if I can help it! 

     
    Rarity Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime! 

     

Filli Vanilli


     
    Fluttershy Oh, good morning, little friends. Your singing is oh-so pretty. 
     
    Fluttershy Yes, it is a very beautiful day today. Certainly something worth singing about. 

        There's music in the treetops 
        And there's music in the vale 
        And all around the music fills the sky 
        There's music by the river 
        And there's music in the grass 
        And the music makes your heart soar in reply 
         

    Animals  
    Fluttershy Oh, thank you so much.  You're too kind. 
    Pinkie Pie Wow! 
    Fluttershy Oh... You... um... you didn't hear me... um... 
    Pinkie Pie Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?!? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, yeah, we did! 
    Fluttershy  

     

    Twilight Sparkle Wow, I've never heard you sing a solo like that before! 
    Applejack It was like a little slice of heaven. 
    Pinkie Pie With ice cream on top! 
    Rarity Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet! 
    Fluttershy Um, well, Iâ€” 
    Rarity Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night! 
    Fluttershy Well, you see, Iâ€” 
    Rarity This simply must be rectified. You must share that stunning voice at the event! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you? Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again! 
    Rarity Pinkie Pie! 
     
    Rarity Don't be ridiculous! 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, but I'm so good at it! 
    Rarity  Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet! 
    Fluttershy No. 
    Rarity Pardon me? 
    Fluttershy I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why not, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have... 
    Rainbow Dash Spit it out! 
    Fluttershy I have... stage fright. 
    Pinkie Pie  Is it contagious?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony. 
    Fluttershy I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm really looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience. 
    Rarity  Well... I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable. 
    Fluttershy Thank you. Oh! Angel's right. We'd better get going. There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event. 

    Rarity

        When you find you've got the music (Rarity Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) 
        Got the music in you (Rarity Oh, you) 
        Find you've got the music (Rarity Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music) 
        Got the music in you 

    Fluttershy  
    Spike Woo-hoo, yeah! Rarity, you were awesome! 
    Rarity Uh, thank you, Spike, but this is an ensemble. 
    Spike Eh, the rest of you were pretty good too. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I thought you were all amazing, Pony Tones! 
    Torch Song Thanks, Fluttershy! 
    Rarity Now, Pony Tones, I want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day. We'll do a final run-through tomorrow before the big event, alright? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Torch Song Sounds great! 
    Fluttershy Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones are really gonna make the Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser so special. Thank you so much for helping me help the animals. 
    Rarity Oh, yes. It is wonderful when a plan comes together without any sort of drama, isn't it? 
    Fluttershy Mm-hmm.  

     
     
     
    Torch Song Morning, Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Good morning, Pony Tones! 
    Rarity Actually, we're the Pony Tones minus one tone. Big Mac is inconveniently late. 
    Big McIntosh  
    Rarity Well, there you are! Haven't I told you about punctuality? Nah-ah! I don't want to hear it!  
    Big McIntosh  
    Rarity Big Mac? Can you please start the song? 
    Big McIntosh  Nope. 
    Rarity Big Mac! Did you lose your voice? 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup. 
    The Ponytones  
    Fluttershy  

    Rarity Whatever did you do to cause this? 
    Big McIntosh  Well... 

    Applejack  Howdy, everypony, and welcome to the twelfth annual Ponyville turkey call! 
     
     
    Applejack Who will take the title this year? Will it be somepony new? Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his title to make it lucky number seven? 
    Granny Smith We'll find out if you stop your gabbin' and get on with the gobblin'! 
    Applejack Alright, everypony! Let's talk turkey! Big Mac, you're up! 
    Big McIntosh  

    Rarity A...a...a turkey call? You lost your voice doing a... a turkey call?! 
    Pinkie Pie Lost his voice and the title!  
    Rarity Now we can't perform tonight! 
    Fluttershy Wait, what? No! You have to perform! Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster! 
    Rarity Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices. 
    Fluttershy Why not? 
    Rarity It would take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time. I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for this situation. 
    Fluttershy  Of course! A remedy! Follow me! 

    Zecora Hmmm. 
    Big McIntosh  Ahhhh. 
    Zecora Hmmm. 
    Big McIntosh  Ahhhâ€” 
    Zecora I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course. 
    Rarity Uh, come again? 
    Zecora Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight. 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! Ah! Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's? 
    Zecora  
    Rarity Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the performance will be ruined! 
    Zecora Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation. 
    Rarity Then what? 
    Zecora Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range. 
    Fluttershy  I don't want to talk about it. 
    Rarity Yes, yes! Your voice became really low, making it sound like... 
    Fluttershy  Flutterguy! 
    Zecora With these leaves I can mix a brew, creating the same effect on you. 
    Rarity Zecora, that's fantastic! 
    Fluttershy Yes! I'll do it! I'd do anything for the animals! 
    Rarity Why, you'd even appear on stage! 
    Fluttershy Oh. Except that. I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony. 
    Rarity What if you sang not in front of everypony? 
    Fluttershy Huh? 
    Rarity What if Big Mac was onstage, moving his lips while you're behind the curtains singing his part? It would be just like singing in your house! Nopony would know it was you! 
    Fluttershy Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of... 
    Rarity You must! For the animals! 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh... Okay then...  Mix it up! 

    Rarity  Now, do it just like we practiced! 
    Fluttershy

    Rarity Good evening, citizens of Ponyville! I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the Ponyville Pet Center! Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!

    Pegasus Dad That was fantastic, Pony Tones! 
    Zipporwhill My new puppy and I thought it was super-duper crazy good!

    Pegasus Dad And we were wondering if you would consider performing at my daughter Zipporwhill's cute-ceaÃ±era. 
    Zipporwhill Will you? Will you? 
    Rarity We'd love to! When is it? Next week? Next month? 
    Pegasus dad and Zipporwhill Tomorrow!

    Mayor Mare Certainly. 
    Rarity  Don't worry, Fluttershy, you don't have to perform again.

    Applejack Poison joke? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Flutterguy? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Better now? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack And that shy filly was livin' her dream in the shadows because she couldn't bring herself to come into the spotlight? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Well, for corn's sake! Let's go! 

    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy? You in here? 
    Fluttershy  Yes... I'm here. 
    Pinkie Pie That was totally unbelievable! I mean, the curtain came up and there you were, singing in front of everypony! And you know, I don't think anypony was jealous, 'cause there certainly wasn't an angry mob! But it must have been horrible standing there on stage, all eyes glued directly on you! It's like you were living your own personal worst nightmare! 
    Fluttershy  It was. 
    Pinkie Pie What? Too much? 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle What Pinkie meant to say is that you were really great! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Didn't I say that? 
    Rarity Hardly! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoops. You were great! 

    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash You totally blew my mind! 
    Applejack Incredible! 
    Pinkie Pie Though, no offense... you kind of sounded like a dude. 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie Uh, a great-sounding dude! 
    Fluttershy Well, thank you all. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Because I'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Are you kidding me?! 
    Rarity Can we please stop running? 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity I just don't understand why, Fluttershy. After all, you're the one that wanted the Pony Tones to sing for every silly thing that was requested of us. 
    Fluttershy You mean, you knew I really wanted to perform? 
    Rarity Of course I knew! 
    Fluttershy Oh... 
    Rarity And, for all her babbling, Pinkie Pie was right about one thing. 
    Pinkie Pie Only one?! 
    Rarity When that curtain fell, and everypony saw you singing, you lived your worst nightmare! Was it really that bad? 
    Fluttershy Yes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, what was so bad about it? 
    Rainbow Dash The thunderous applause? 
    Applejack The praise for your fantastic singin'? 
    Pinkie Pie The screaming fans?! 

    

        There's music in the treetops 
        And there's music in the vale 
        And all around the music fills the sky 
        There's music by the river 
        And there's music in the grass 
        And the music makes your heart soar in reply 

    

        When you find you've got the music 

    

        You've got to look inside and find 

    

        Find you've got the music 

    

        The music deep inside you 

    

        Find you've got the music 

    

        'Cause when you look inside, you'll see it 

    

        Find you've got the music 

    

        You're gonna find it, gonna find 

    

        You've got the music 
        Got the music, got the music 
        Got the music in you! 

    Rest of main cast  
    Rainbow Dash You did it, Fluttershy! 
    Applejack See? That wasn't so bad. 
    Pinkie Pie And you didn't look completely petrified by the fact that we're all staring at you at all! 
    Twilight Sparkle How do you feel? 
    Fluttershy Surprisingly... okay! 
    Rarity Fantastic, because the Pony Tones have been booked for the Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire! 
    Fluttershy Oh, no... I couldn't do that! 
    Applejack How come? 

    Rainbow Dash 
    Seriously? 

    

    Pinkie Pie 
    For real? 

    

    Twilight Sparkle 
    Come on, Fluttershy... 

    Fluttershy I'll get there someday. But for now... baby steps, everypony. Baby steps. 

    Fluttershy Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be. 

     

Twilight Time

    Twilight Sparkle Uh, Sweetie Belle, maybe we should run through the steps another few times before you try it on your own. 
    Sweetie Belle Nope. Ready to give it a shot! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay then! 
    Sweetie Belle  Ugh! Think I threw my neck out... 
    Scootaloo Aw, you're okay. 
    Apple Bloom A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch! 
    Sweetie Belle I doubt it. That thing weighs a ton. 
     
    Spike Hey, has anypony seen myâ€“ Oh, there it is.  
    Sweetie Belle Hmph. I'll never get my cutie mark for this... 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe not. But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like. 
    Spike Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess? 
    Scootaloo This is no mess! These are the carefully arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back together... as soon as Twilight shows me how.  
    Twilight Sparkle Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself. 
    Scootaloo Ugh, I hate research! 
    Twilight Sparkle To your left, third shelf from the bottom. You'll find it in no time. 
    Apple Bloom Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake. 
    Apple Bloom Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you? 
    Apple Bloom Well... uh... more or less. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do. 
    Apple Bloom Oh... I hope this works. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Seedling  
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal? 

     

     
    Diamond Tiara Yoo-hoo! Gather 'round! It's time! 
    Foals  
    Diamond Tiara As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today! 
    Foals  
    Diamond Tiara I know, it's so exciting. But I'm tired. 
    Foals Awww... 
    Diamond Tiara But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me. 
    Foals  
    Silver Spoon That was amazing, Diamond Tiara. 
    Diamond Tiara I know. I don't know how I do it. 
    Apple Bloom I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything! 
    Scootaloo She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do! 
    Sweetie Belle Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm... 

    Scootaloo Check this out! 
    Apple Bloom And check this out! 
    Foals  
    Sweetie Belle Now check this out! 
    Diamond Tiara  Hey, put me down! 
    Foals  

    Sweetie Belle  
    Diamond Tiara Hey, can you hear me? 
    Sweetie Belle Huh? Huh? What? What? 
    Diamond Tiara I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon. 
    Silver Spoon Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities. 
    Scootaloo Cool! 
    Apple Bloom Wow, that's... pretty nice of you guys. 
    Sweetie Belle Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon. 
    Diamond Tiara Yeah, we figured. 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon Bump, bump, sugar lump rump!  
    Sweetie Belle Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time! 
    Diamond Tiara D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real? 
    Apple Bloom More like just once a week. 
    Scootaloo She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves! 
    Diamond Tiara You must bring me along next time you go! 
    Silver Spoon Bring us along! 
    Diamond Tiara I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, "whatever"... 
    Silver Spoon Me too. I thought that. 
    Diamond Tiara But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome! 
    Silver Spoon Plus, she has wings. 
    Diamond Tiara And she's an Alicorn. So can Iâ€“ 
    Silver Spoon We! 
    Diamond Tiara â€“go? 
    Apple Bloom I don't think we shouldâ€“ 
    Sweetie Belle Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity! 
    Apple Bloom Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits! 
    Sweetie Belle But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too! 
    Scootaloo And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own. 
    Apple Bloom I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change. 

    Diamond Tiara Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am! 
    Silver Spoon I can't either! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey there, guys! Come on in! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  Princess Twilight! 
    Diamond Tiara Oh, it's really her! 
    Silver Spoon Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, and, uh, you brought guests. Great! 
    Diamond Tiara Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea. Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail? 
    Silver Spoon I so have to get that done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, it's not dyed. I've alwaysâ€“ 
    Diamond Tiara  Are those books in there? What a bold design choice! 
    Silver Spoon You should so do that, Di! 
    Diamond Tiara I know, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first? 
    Sweetie Belle Shouldn't they go first? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming. 

    Apple Bloom I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday. 
    Scootaloo I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom. 
    Apple Bloom 'Cause they laughed on the inside. 
    Sweetie Belle Don't worry. We won't make that same mistake again. 
    Apple Bloom Aw, great. Look who showed up to make fun of us. 
    Scootaloo So much for learning skills to be big shots. 
    Diamond Tiara Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, no, here it comes... 
    Diamond Tiara And they all want in! 
    Foals Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time!  
    Diamond Tiara Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around. You're welcome. 
    Sweetie Belle Uh-oh... 

    Foals Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time!  
    Sweetie Belle Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly? 
    Pipsqueak We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Foals  
    Diamond Tiara Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do. Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends? 
    Silver Spoon Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing! 
    Foals  
    Apple Bloom What a mess. 
    Sweetie Belle Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now! 
    Scootaloo Huh? 
    Sweetie Belle They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight! 
    Apple Bloom We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class? 
    Sweetie Belle Relax. I got this. 

    Apple Bloom I don't like this, Sweetie Belle... 
    Sweetie Belle You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem? 
    Scootaloo This feels like a trick. 
    Sweetie Belle What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess! 
    Pipsqueak Did someone say "princess"? 
    Sweetie Belle When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops! 
    Foals Oops... 
    Scootaloo She's coming! 
    Sweetie Belle Okay! But stay out of sight! 
    Diamond Tiara As you wish, Sweetie Belle. 
    Sweetie Belle Yes, as I wish. 

    Twilight Sparkle  I'm so honored! Mm! 
    Sweetie Belle You are? 
    Twilight Sparkle When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age! 
    Sweetie Belle Yes, well... we feel the same way. 
    Apple Bloom That's why we invited you here. 
    Scootaloo All because of our love of learning! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know. I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here! 
    Pinkie Pie Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh, never mind, they're gone. They're back! Never mind, they're gone. La la-la la-la... 
     
    Apple Bloom  Knock it off! 
    Twilight Sparkle What in the world is going on outâ€“  
    Apple Bloom What was all this? And this? 
    Scootaloo I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, we're gonna look sad all right... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Uh, can I... help you? 
    Foals  
    Diamond Tiara Get my picture with her! 
    Pipsqueak Me first! 
    Silver Spoon Hey! Get out of the shot! 
    Sweetie Belle This is bad. 
    Scootaloo Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us. 
    Apple Bloom I told ya this was a terrible idea. 
    Twilight Sparkle You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are! 
    Pipsqueak Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess! 
    Twilight Sparkle This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them. 
    Pipsqueak You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around! 
    Foals  
    Pipsqueak I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week! 
    Sweetie Belle Relax. I know exactly how to handle this. 

     
    Foals  
     
    Pipsqueak More lemonade? 
    Sweetie Belle Don't mind if I do! 
    Classmate Pony 2 Done shining your hooves! It's an honor to do you the favor! 
    Scootaloo Whoa, so bright I can see myself! 
    Apple Bloom And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you? 
    Classmate Pony 3 Your gratitude is thanks enough. 
    Diamond Tiara You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this. 
    Sweetie Belle Look who's inviting who to her fancy house! 
    Apple Bloom I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! 

     
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here. Why is this party cooler, exactly? 
    Diamond Tiara Because of all the ponies we're keeping out. 
    Sweetie Belle This has been great, but we have to go. It's Twilight Time. 
    Diamond Tiara So, we're coming too, right? 
    Sweetie Belle Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, soâ€“ 
    Diamond Tiara Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you? 
    Foals Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time!  
    Sweetie Belle Okay, I know exactly how to handle this. Run! 

    Foals Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time!  
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Sweetie Belle Go, go, go! 
    Scootaloo We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain! 
    Sweetie Belle This way! I know a shortcut! 
    Foals Twilight Time!  
    Apple Bloom Then we run, like the wind! 
    Foals Twilight Time! Twilight Time! 

    Sweetie Belle  We... made... it... Quick! Knock onâ€“ 
     
     
     
    Sweetie Belle Twilight, we can explain. 
    Apple Bloom We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us! 
    Scootaloo We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine. 
    Scootaloo So you're not mad? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos! 
    Foals  
    Twilight Sparkle Turns out we'll need some more than that. 
    Spike  

    Foals  
    Twilight Sparkle Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there. 
    Apple Bloom Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine. 
    Scootaloo And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us. 
    Sweetie Belle Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this! 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things. 
    Diamond Tiara Thank you, princess! 
    Silver Spoon We love you, princess! 
    Foals  
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time. 
    Sweetie Belle It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do. 
    Diamond Tiara Hmph! What a laugh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one? 
    Pipsqueak I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader! 
    Twilight Sparkle And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm? 
    Pipsqueak Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess! 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, boy. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is this true? 
    Sweetie Belle We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly! 
    Twilight Sparkle Prove it. 
    Sweetie Belle Huh?! 
    Twilight Sparkle If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week. Show me how much better you got. 
    Apple Bloom Uh, well, uh... we... can't. 
    Scootaloo We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hm, I see. 
    Sweetie Belle No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time! 
    Foals  
    Sweetie Belle Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside. 
    Pipsqueak Hey! That's my scooter! 
    Scootaloo You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us. 
    Pipsqueak Huh? 
    Sweetie Belle Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom! 
    Scootaloo Ta-da! 
    Apple Bloom Become a tree! 
    Sweetie Belle Rise! 
     
     
    Sweetie Belle That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped. 
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like Twilight Time is over. 
    Diamond Tiara And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore. 
    Foals Oooh! 
    Silver Spoon Guess they didn't come here to learn after all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, neither did any of you. 
    Foals Awww... 
    Sweetie Belle We're really sorry, Twilight. We made a huge mistake. 
    Apple Bloom And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you. 
    Scootaloo Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight. 
     
    Apple Bloom Thanks... 
    Sweetie Belle Thanks... 
    Twilight Sparkle Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance? 
    Spike  Aw, come on! 

    Sweetie Belle I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special â€“ because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time! 
    Sweetie Belle We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us. 
    Apple Bloom 'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now? 
    Scootaloo Or because we look ridiculous? 
    Sweetie Belle A little of both, actually. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

It Ain't Easy Being Breezies

    Fluttershy Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville. 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close! 
    Rainbow Dash I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will! 
    Fluttershy And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer! 
    Pinkie Pie I love cheers! 
    Fluttershy But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies. 
    Rest of main cast  You can do it, Breezies! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my. 
    Applejack Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly. 
    Fluttershy Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again. 
    Rest of main cast  You can do it, Breezies! 
    Fluttershy Perhaps just a little bit quieter. 
    Rest of main cast  You can do it, Breezies! 
    Fluttershy Just a little quieter. 
    Rest of main cast  You can do it, Breezies! 
    Fluttershy  Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay. 

     

     
     
    Rainbow Dash That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart! 
    Mr. Cake What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them. 
    Fluttershy Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed. 
    Mr. Cake So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad? 
    Fluttershy That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely. 
    Mrs. Cake We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path! 
    Fluttershy Now you understand. 
    Mr. Cake Hm, you certainly know a lot about them. 
    Fluttershy Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but... 
    Rarity Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it. 
    Twilight Sparkle What?! I- 
    Fluttershy Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket. 
    Rarity Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins!  
    Fluttershy You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home! 
    Rarity I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies! 
    Applejack They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born. 
    Rarity And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in? 
    Seabreeze Lun! Arshen aifo! 
    Pinkie Pie So... cute! Can't... take... it! 
    Spike  Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies? 
    Pinkie Pie  May explode! 
     
     
    Spike Oh, no! 
    Breezies  
    Crowd  
    Rainbow Dash Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up! 
    Cloud Chaser They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies! 
    Rainbow Dash What if we speed it up? 
    Flitter Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other! 
    Breezies  

    Breezies  
    Seabreeze Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa! 
    Fluttershy  
    Seabreeze Mekenar stuf! 
    Fluttershy He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can! 
    Crowd  
    Seabreeze Mugudi saikendus? 
    Fluttershy Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures! 
    Seabreeze You must be so proud. 
    Fluttershy And you speak my language too? 
    Seabreeze I can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around. 
    Breezies  
    Pinkie Pie That was amazing! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others. 
    Fluttershy Oh, it's not your fault. 
    Twilight Sparkle I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that. 
    Rarity I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash. 
    Spike Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?!  I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry! 
    Fluttershy Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us. 
    Spike Okay... Thank you! 
    Breezies  
    Spike Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here. 
    Rainbow Dash So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on? 
    Breezies  
    Fluttershy Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much... 
    Rainbow Dash Just gimme the word when you think they're ready. 

    Angel  
    Fluttershy Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket. 
    Twirly Sanken 
    Fluttershy Oh, no problem. 
    Breezie Malenki? 
    Fluttershy Oh, did you need some more water? 
    Breezie  
    Fluttershy Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater? 
    Breezies  
    Applejack Hey there! Can we come in? 
    Fluttershy Oh, of course! But watch your step! 
    Applejack Oop, sorry about that, little one. 
    Twilight Sparkle We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try. 
    Fluttershy Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world. 
    Twilight Sparkle But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home. 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes, that's right! 
    Breezies  
    Fluttershy On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready. 
    Seabreeze Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat! 
    Applejack Uh... what did he say? 
    Fluttershy I'd... rather not say. 
    Applejack Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do. 
    Twilight Sparkle We'll just wait for your word. 
    Fluttershy Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon. 
     
    Seabreeze We need to go now, or we will never get home! I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe? 
    Fluttershy Um, now, Seabreeze- 
    Seabreeze Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened! 
    Fluttershy But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that! 
    Seabreeze Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent! 
    Fluttershy Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I? 
    Seabreeze Hmph! 
    Fluttershy Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood. 
    Breezies  

    Breezies  
    Breezie  Mi fargen. 
    Fluttershy You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that- 
    Seabreeze There is nothing special about these losers! They cannot handle a simple breeze home! If they could just stick with the program and listen to me, we would be safe! At home! Home, where every Breezie is like us!  
    Fluttershy Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible! 
    Breezie  Merte marshken farde. 
    Twirly  Merki marshken plumatu. 
    Fluttershy I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you? 
    Breezies  
    Fluttershy Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now? 
    Breezies  
    Seabreeze D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home. 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, alright. 
    Flitter We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle. 
    Rainbow Dash We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing. 

    Breezies  
     
     
    Breezies Aww! 
    Seabreeze Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home! 
    Fluttershy Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home. 
    Breezies  
    Fluttershy Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be... 
    Twirly Adoshen papan gorn. 
    Fluttershy Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze?  Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own! 

     
    Seabreeze Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah! 
     
    Seabreeze Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda! 
     
     
    Seabreeze Vaior uskren! Yavaya... 
     
    Seabreeze Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada! 
    Fluttershy Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me! 
    Seabreeze Menkyulen. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me! 
    Fluttershy Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat! 
    Seabreeze Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything...  Time is running out, and you may never make it home! 
    Seabreeze That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me! 
    Fluttershy Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across. 
    Seabreeze But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened! 
    Fluttershy Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now! 

    Fluttershy My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville. 
    Breezies Erski parli polin! 
    Fluttershy I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm! You must go, now!  
     

     
    Rainbow Dash It's too strong! 
    Flitter I can't do it any lighter! 
    Cloud Chaser Neither can I! 
    Rainbow Dash Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me. 
    Pinkie Pie I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Main cast  
    Fluttershy Maifo flai batendud!  Um, I mean, let's go! 

     
    Breezette Marskin farskin. 
    Breezie Metar. 
    Seabreeze You can do this! I am sorry for how I treated you before! It was not right that I called you names! I did not even really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group! 

     
    Main cast  
    Rainbow Dash  Holy mini-sized paradise! 
    Rarity  This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it? 
    Pinkie Pie  So...stinkin'...cute! 
    Breezies  
    Applejack  You okay, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy  I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family! 
    Breezies  
    Rarity  We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes. 
    Fluttershy  Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now. 
    Seabreeze To remember us by. 
    Fluttershy  My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do. 
    Rainbow Dash  Whoa! That was a close one! 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, gather round. 
     
    Rainbow Dash So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not a chance. 
    Rainbow Dash You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire! 

     

Somepony to Watch Over Me

    Applejack, Big McIntosh and Granny Smith  
    Scootaloo Whatever they decide, Apple Bloom, we'll be here for you. 
    Sweetie Belle Totally. Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever! 
     
    Granny Smith So, we here have decided... that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon! 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
    Apple Bloom I accept your decision. 
    Apple Bloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  

     

    Apple Bloom Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own! I can't believe I'm really doin' it! 
    Applejack Now, hey there, filly. I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility. 
    Apple Bloom I know it! And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it. I won't let you down. 
    Granny Smith Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off. When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there! You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom. Y'all take care as well. I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher. you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack We know, Granny. That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone. 
    Apple Bloom It is? 
    Applejack Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube. It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this. 
    Apple Bloom What is it? 
    Applejack Just a little list of helpful reminders. 
    Apple Bloom  "There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator. Be sure not to heat it up too much. If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off. And take little sips â€” if you gulp, you could get hiccups." You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and the chores! I'm ready for this. 
    Applejack  I guess you are. I'm just not so sure I am. 
    Apple Bloom But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right? 
    Applejack  Right. Okay then. Good luck, little sisâ€” whoa! 
    Apple Bloom  Okaygreatseeyousoonbye! 
    Applejack, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith  
    Big McIntosh Eyuu-up! 
    Apple Bloom Woo-hoo! I'm alone! At home! I'm home alone! This is gonna be so awesome! 

    Applejack  
     
    Applejack Eheheh... Sorry, Big Mac. I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom. You think she's gonna be okay on her own? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list. Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first.  I know, I'm probably just bein' silly. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time. You go on ahead and make your delivery. I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine. 

    Apple Bloom Okay, number one seventy two "Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm." 
     
    Apple Bloom Check! "Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked." Check!  That's everything on Applejack's list! And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions! If I wanna listen to music, I can! If I wanna read a book, I can! If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can! 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! 
    Apple Bloom Whoa! 
     
    Apple Bloom Ugh... Applejack? 
    Applejack I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did! I never thought about how dangerous things are around here! 
    Apple Bloom Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay. 
    Applejack You are now! Because I'm here and I'm stayin'! No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself! 
    Apple Bloom I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver? 
    Applejack Pies? Ha! Family's way more important than pies! 
    Apple Bloom But I'm fine! And actually... this was kind of your fault. 
    Applejack I know. I should never have left you alone. 
    Apple Bloom But I don't need you lookin' after me. I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone. Really! Just look! "There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator." 
    Applejack What was that? 
    Apple Bloom Watch me! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Whoa! Ugh! 
    Applejack Oh, no! This is worse than I thought! Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again. I'm stickin' right by your side, always! 

    Applejack Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom! 
    Apple Bloom Applejack's just overreactin' a bit. I'm sure she'll snap out of it. Whoa! 
    Applejack You need somethin'? I'm right here! 
    Apple Bloom I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me! I can take care of things myself! 
    Applejack  
    Apple Bloom Look! Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake? 
    Applejack  Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie? 
    Apple Bloom  

    Apple Bloom Hey, Applejack! Watch me buck these apples on my own without anythin' bad happenin' to me!  
     
     
    Apple Bloom Huh?  

    Apple Bloom Hm? Hm. 

     
    Apple Bloom Oh, for the love of...!  You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'! 
    Applejack Heh, yup! Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again. 
    Apple Bloom But really, I'm fine! I can take care of myself. I don't need you watchin' over me! 
    Applejack Aw, that's sweet. I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry. I'll always be here for you. Always! 
    Apple Bloom  

    Apple Bloom  And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick. 
    Applejack Hey, Apple Bloom! You need anything? A snack? A hoof massage? Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage? 
    Sweetie Belle Why, that sounds delightful! 
    Apple Bloom  No thank you! 
    Applejack O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'! 
    Apple Bloom  You see what I mean? If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Mm-hm. 
    Scootaloo So what can we do? Hmm. 
    Sweetie Belle Uh... 
    Scootaloo Um... 
    Apple Bloom Hang on a sec! I got it! 
    Sweetie Belle What? 
    Apple Bloom The pies! I'll sneak out and deliver them! Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town. If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me! 
    Scootaloo Just one problem. Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute! 
    Sweetie Belle Which means you need an escape plan. 
    Scootaloo Ooh, and I got an idea for one!  See? It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed. Sweetie and I can take turns! That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. Brilliant, huh? 
    Sweetie Belle Mm-hm! 
    Apple Bloom You know what? It is! I got a feelin' this just might work!

        We're gonna make my sister see 
        I don't need her watchin' over meâ€” 

    Scootaloo Stop! No time for a song! Applejack's coming! 
    Sweetie Belle If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now! 
    Apple Bloom Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it! 
     
    Apple Bloom Whoa! 
     
    Applejack  Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube? 
    Scootaloo Quick, get in while I hide! Sweetie, no! You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom! 
    Sweetie Belle How does she sleep? 
    Scootaloo Like she does everything! With sass! 
    Applejack Huh. I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed. Then again, you are a delicate flower.  Sleep tight, Apple Bloom. I'll check on you again in a bit. 
     
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
     
    Applejack Just checkin' in on you again! 
     
     
    Applejack Need anythin' now? 
     
    Applejack How 'bout now? 
     
    Applejack Need another blanket? 
     
    Applejack Did I hear a cough? 
     
    Applejack Want a glass of water? 
     
    Sweetie Belle  
     
    Applejack  Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like. Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine. Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time. 
    Scootaloo  Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that! 
    Applejack Huh? Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo Uh, um, n-no. 
    Applejack Sweetie Belle? But... where's Apple Bloom? She's not here! She could be anywhere! She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom! 
    Sweetie Belle Don't worry, we know exactly where she is. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, she's making your pie delivery. 
    Applejack What?! No! Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?!  I may never see my little sister again! 

    Applejack Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two. Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots? A lion tamer's chair? A snake charmin' flute?! A hunk of ricotta?!  Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there. When did she leave? 
    Sweetie Belle It must've been hours ago. 
    Applejack Oh, no! 

    Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom Well, now at least I can see. 
     
    Chimera's tiger head I'd stay where you are. This is the only safe spot around here. 
    Apple Bloom  It don't look so safe to me. 
    Chimera's tiger head Oh, we just mean from the flames. 
    Chimera's goat head Yeah, not from us. 
    Chimera's snake head What was that? Ah, can you guysss ssspeak up? 
    Chimera's tiger head I was about to tell our guest how we haven't eaten in days. 
    Chimera's goat head My sisters and I can never agree on what to eat. 
    Chimera's snake head  Excccept... pie. 
    Apple Bloom Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh... 
    Chimera's tiger head Oh, you don't have to worry about that. 
    Chimera's goat head Yeah, you don't have to worry about anything anymore. 
    Chimera's snake head Because we're going to have our apple pie with a ssside of filly filet. 
    Apple Bloom You don't say.  
    Chimera  
    Chimera's tiger head Now, sisters, on three! One! 
    Chimera's goat head Two! 
    Chimera's snake head  Three! 
     
    Apple Bloom No! 
    Chimera's tiger head Where do you think you're going?  
    Chimera's snake head  
    Apple Bloom Yaaah!  
    Chimera  
    Chimera's tiger head Where are the pies?! 
    Chimera's snake head They're not back here. 
    Chimera's goat head This is your fault! You think you've always got to be in charge! 
    Chimera's tiger head  You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder! 
    Apple Bloom Uh, actually... 
    Chimera's goat head Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet! 
    Chimera's snake head  Any lassst wordsss? 
    Apple Bloom I really wish my sister were here! 
    Applejack Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'! 
    Chimera's tiger head and goat head Get her! 
    Chimera's goat head Hey! I thought I was in charge now! 
    Chimera's tiger head  
    Applejack  
    Chimera's snake head  
    Chimera's tiger head  
    Applejack Howdy! 
     
     
    Chimera's tiger head  
    Chimera's goat head  Mm, ricotta! 
    Chimera  
    Applejack Let's go! 
     
    Applejack  Are you okay? 
    Apple Bloom Thanks to you. 
    Applejack I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you! I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse. I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you'reâ€” Huh, the cart! And all the pies! You actually got them all the way up here? In the dark? Through the Flame Geyser Swamp? Past that monster? ...By yourself? 
    Apple Bloom Well... yeah. 
    Applejack Huh, wow. That's mighty impressive! Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her. 

    Cajun Swamp Pony Mm-hm! Andouille! This pie's even tastier than my momma's swamp water casserole! 
     
    Cajun Swamp Pony Aw, now, momma, don't be like that. 
    Applejack Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister. 
    Apple Bloom And my sister! 
    Applejack But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do! 
    Apple Bloom I know... 
    Applejack  I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out! And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out. 
    Apple Bloom Yes! Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate! So... we're good? 
    Applejack Little sister, we're always good. 

     

Maud Pie

    Applejack Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday? 
    Rest of main cast Nuh-uh. 
    Rainbow Dash  I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early. Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I hope everything's okay.  
     
    Pinkie Pie Thank goodness you're all here! There's no time to lose! 
    Rarity Whoa! 
    Fluttershy Ooh... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Hey- whoa! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Careful! 
    Twilight Sparkle What is all this? 
    Pinkie Pie My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes! 
    Applejack Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy. 
    Rarity Even for you. 
    Pinkie Pie I may have gone a teensy bit overboard.  

     

    Main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Everypony ready for more? 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. My teeth hurt. 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, but you've only tried half of the flavors, and we have to choose the perfect ones before she gets here so I have time to make more!  
    Twilight Sparkle Maud is your sister. I'm sure she'll love your rock candy. And I'm pretty sure you've made enough. She's only staying for the week. 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly. I'm making candy for all of us! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie It's part of a very important, super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share. We're going to make rock candy necklaces together!  
    Applejack Aw, what a great tradition. 
    Rainbow Dash Hold on. The secret ingredient is rocks? 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah. But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered. 
    Fluttershy Oh, what kind of a rock are they? 
    Pinkie Pie Can't tell ya that, silly!  Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time. I can't wait for you all to meet her. I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends! We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together! She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight! And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome! 
    Rarity  She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here? 
    Pinkie Pie She sure will.  I gotta get out of here! 

     
    Winona  
    Fluttershy I sure hope Maud has an appetite. 
    Applejack Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins! 
    Rarity Oh, it's no use! I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear! 
    Rainbow Dash I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal? 
    Rarity The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think we're all a little nervous about Maud's visit. She's Pinkie Pie's sister, and it's obvious Pinkie really wants us to hit it off. Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her. I'm sure everything will be fineâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie We're heeeere! 
    Twilight Sparkle Where's Maud? 
    Pinkie Pie She's coming! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh... you sure? 
    Pinkie Pie She's not quite as fast as me. I asked Gummy to stay with her in case she got lost! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  Is she even moving? 
    Pinkie Pie We're over here, Maud! 
    Maud Pie  Hm. Sedimentary. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Maud Pie  This is a sedimentary rock. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle That's... really fascinating, isn't it, girls? We're just so thrilled you could come for a visit before your big trip. Pinkie Pie has told us so much about you. I'm Twilight, and this is Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity. 
    Fluttershy We're ever so glad to meet you. 
    Applejack We're just gonna have the best time! 
     
    Rarity Pinkie Pie tells me you share my love for fashion. 
    Maud Pie  I'm really into expressing myself through my wardrobe. 
    Rarity A-and what is the delightful frock you're wearing now saying? 
    Maud Pie  It doesn't talk. It's a dress. 
    Rarity Oh, yes, of course, I, I just meant, the frock is, just...  
    Winona  
    Applejack Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too. 
    Maud Pie  He's in my pocket. 
    Fluttershy Oh, you have a pocket pet? Like a tiny mouse? Or a baby bird? Or a trained butterfly? 
    Maud Pie  It's a rock. His name is Boulder. 
    Pinkie Pie This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever! I can't wait for us all to become bestest friends! 
    Rest of main cast  

    Applejack Maud? Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins? 
    Maud Pie  
    Applejack Oh, uh, heh, that's notâ€“ Um... 
    Maud Pie  It's crunchy. 
    Pinkie Pie  Maud's right! They are crunchy! Yum! 
    Rainbow Dash So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games. 
    Maud Pie  Boulder and I sometimes play a game called 'Camouflage'. It's kind of like hide and seek but way more intense. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Awesome? 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Any luck? 
    Fluttershy I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like. 
    Applejack It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack. 
    Rarity More like in a pile of pebbles. 
    Applejack Well, you don't have to make it even harder. 
    Rarity Ugh! I give up! this is impossible! 
    Twilight Sparkle It'll hurt Maud's feelings if we all stop playing. Besides, look how much fun Pinkie Pie's having. 
    Pinkie Pie Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? 
    Twilight Sparkle Just a little longer, okay? 
    Applejack Uh, alright, fine... 
    Rainbow Dash  Really? 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Maud Pie  Found him. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! Where was he? 
    Maud Pie  He was hiding in my pocket. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, come on! 
     
    Fluttershy I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home. It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day. 
    Pinkie Pie Maud and I had better get going too. I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces! Aw, yeah! 
    Applejack She sure is... different from what I expected. 
    Rainbow Dash We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?! 
    Fluttershy On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet. 
    Rainbow Dash He's a rock! 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, girls. I'm sure Maud was just nervous about meeting all of us. 
    Applejack Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once, especially since we're already such good friends. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe if we spend some time with her one-on-one to try to get to know her better, I'm sure we'll be making those best friend rock candy necklaces in no time. 

    Rarity Where shall we start? I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with yâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Choices, choices, choices! 
    Rarity ...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggestâ€“ 
    Maud Pie  I like this one. 
    Rarity  Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny! 
    Maud Pie  What do you mean? 
    Rarity Oh, well, it's just... I believe that is a dishtowel.  B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion. I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous. 
    Pinkie Pie Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing! This is the best day ever! 
    Rarity Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like. 
    Maud Pie  No thanks. One is enough. 
    Pinkie Pie Doesn't Maud make the coolest scarves? 
    Rarity Quite... 

    Hummingway  
    Fluttershy Hello there, Hummingway. I'm ever so happy to see you. 
    Hummingway  
    Pinkie Pie What's he saying? 
    Fluttershy He says hello, and he's happy to see us too. 
    Pinkie Pie I wish I could speak hummingbird. Humm! Hum-m-m-m-m, hum! 
    Fluttershy  These spiders only live in Ponyville, and even though they may look a teeny bit scary, they're actually very sweet and help keep other, more dangerous insects away! 
    Maud Pie I was looking at the rock. 
    Fluttershy Oh. 

    Pinkie Pie Thanks again, Fluttershy! Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace! 
    Fluttershy Oh gosh. I'm not sure we're even friends yet. 

    Pinkie Pie Maud is a total bookworm. She loves poetry! 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got lots of poetry. Do you read anything by Quilland Ink? Or Flourish Prose? 
    Maud Pie  I prefer to read my own poetry. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'd love to hear some of it! 
    Maud Pie 

        Rock. 
        You are a rock. 
        Gray. 
        You are gray. 
        Like a rock. 
        Which you are. 
        Rock. 

    I've written thousands. 
    Pinkie Pie She's so prolific! 
    Maud Pie  This next one is about rocks. They're all about rocks.

        Rocks; these are my rocks. 
        Sediments make me sedimental. 
        Smooth and round, asleep in the ground. 
        Shades of brown and gray... 

    Applejack You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud? 
    Maud Pie  I think this one is done. 
    Applejack Oh, uh, yep. That's a very interestin' method you got there.  
    Maud Pie  Should I peel another? 
    Applejack No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already. 
    Pinkie Pie  Can we taste it now? 
    Applejack Sure, why not? 
    Pinkie Pie  Wow! That's the best apple cider I've ever had! 
    Applejack What do you think, Maud? 
    Maud Pie  It tastes like apples. 
    Pinkie Pie Told you she was super honest, just like you! 
    Applejack  We're practically twins, heh. 

    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! Let's see you beat that! Whooaa! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie That was amazing! 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa. How'd you do that? 
    Maud Pie  I threw it. 
    Rainbow Dash I guess you won this one, Maud. 
    Maud Pie  I'm not really into... 'winning'. 
    Rainbow Dash  

    Pinkie Pie Great, you're all here! Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces! 
     
    Pinkie Pie What's wrong? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'm not sure it's the best time to make best friend rock candy necklaces. 
    Pinkie Pie Why not? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... 
    Rarity Well, darling, you see... 
    Fluttershy You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh... 
    Pinkie Pie But what? 
    Applejack  The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Applejack We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't. 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh. Okay. If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy. 
     

    Rarity I feel awful! Just awful... 
    Fluttershy Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud. 
    Twilight Sparkle If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, I think Maud would have. 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe, but who really knows? That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous. 
    Rarity Don't you mean "inside an enigma"? 
    Rainbow Dash Nope. I mean igneous. It's a kind of rock. Ask me how I know that. 
     
    Pinkie Pie I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together! 

    Pinkie Pie I call it "Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud Fun Time"!  
    Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends! You'll need these. 
    Rainbow Dash Like I said Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie Probably better for me to show you. Watch this! Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy... 
     
    Pinkie Pie Cupcakes for yours truly...  and it's a race for Rainbow Dash! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, what is that?! 
    Pinkie Pie A rock slide, of course! For Maud! First you climb, then you slide! 
    Applejack I've got a bad feeling about this... 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack Watch out! 
    Pinkie Pie Huh?  
     
    Rest of main cast  
    Rainbow Dash Whatâ€“ howâ€“ what?! 
    Maud Pie Pinkie Pie, what were you thinking? 
    Pinkie Pie I guess I wasn't. 
    Maud Pie I know how important it is to you that your friends become my friends, but I just don't think it's going to happen. I think it would be best if I just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there. It was nice to meet you all. Makes me happy knowing Pinkie Pie has such good friends. 
    Pinkie Pie But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces... Wait, Maud! I'll come with you! 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe Maud cut her trip short. 
    Rarity I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course. 
    Fluttershy Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time. 
    Rainbow Dash Did you see how fast Maud moved? 
    Rarity And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust? How in Equestria did she do that? 
    Fluttershy Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share! 

     
    Maud Pie Thank you for coming with me. I don't know how long I'll be gone on my rock research trip. I'm glad I still get to spend some time with you before I go. 
    Pinkie Pie Me too. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond. I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister. 

    Pinkie Pie What are you doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry we hurt your feelings by not bonding with Maud right away. And Maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare Pinkie Pie's feelings was to leave Ponyville early. 
    Rest of main cast Mm-hm. 
    Applejack We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie's happiness means as much to us as it does to you, and we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner. The thing that makes us click and creates a special bond between us is how much we all love Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, shucks! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me. What do you think, Maud? 
    Maud Pie Sure. 
     
    Pinkie Pie What's wrong? 
    Rarity Sorry, darling. I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you kidding me? I've never seen her more excited in my entire life! 
    Maud Pie  I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't show my enthusiasm for things quite in the same way my sister does. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, we noticed. And we're totally cool with it. 
    Rest of main cast  

     
    Twilight Sparkle Maud, we'd like to give you something to take on your trip, so that you remember all your friends from Ponyville. 
    Maud Pie  Thank you. 
    Pinkie Pie Try not to eat all the candy before you leave!  
    Twilight Sparkle Are those all the necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you? 
    Maud Pie  Mm-hm. 
    Twilight Sparkle You haven't eaten any of them? 
    Maud Pie  I don't really like candy. But I do love Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie  Mmm! 

     

For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils

    Sweetie Belle I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet? 
    Rarity Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi. Perhaps it needs... appliquÃ©s. 
    Sweetie Belle AppliquÃ©s? 
    Rarity Or sequins. 
    Sweetie Belle Sequins! 
     
    Rarity Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but... 
    Sweetie Belle Guess I got a little carried away. It's just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers. 
    Rarity This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest! 
    Sweetie Belle But is there time? 
    Rarity Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think I need your expertise. 
    Rarity My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them? 
    Sweetie Belle Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show! 
    Rarity But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is! 
    Sweetie Belle I understand. 
    Rarity I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe... 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, thank you thank you thank you thank you! You're the best sister ever! The dresses are right over there!  

     

    Cheerilee My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes! 
    Scootaloo I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes. 
    Sweetie Belle She's been very busy lately! 
    Apple Bloom But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she has known about this for weeks, right? 
    Sweetie Belle I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way! 
    Apple Bloom But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight! 
    Cheerilee Places! 
    Rarity Oh, I'm here, I'm here! 
    Sweetie Belle  You made it! 
    Rarity Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so. 
    Cheerilee Places! Hello? 

     
     
    Sweetie Belle Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies. 

     
    Apple Bloom Wow! A standin' ovation! 
    Scootaloo I still have goosebumps! 
    Apple Bloom This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle? 
    Scootaloo Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark? 
    Apple Bloom Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting? 
    Sweetie Belle  Let's not get carried away. We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise. Try to be gracious. 
    Scootaloo Modest. 
    Apple Bloom Classy. 

     
    Sweetie Belle Here we are, the stars of the show! 
    Apple Bloom You may tell us how much you loved it now. 
    Scootaloo Line forms here! 
    Spike Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it! 
    Apple Bloom Would have? 
    Spike They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning. 
    Scootaloo Even Rainbow Dash? 
    Spike Yeah. Rarity fell way behind. 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Aww. 
    Spike Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch. 
    Sweetie Belle At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it. 
     
    Sweetie Belle What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting? 
    Lemon Hearts Oh my, I- I loved the dresses. 
    Noteworthy I liked some of those lines you said. 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, really? Which ones? 
    Noteworthy Uh, I don't really remember, but you were wearing a pink taffeta dress with lots of chiffon when you said them! Whoo-ee, that outfit was a dazzler! 
    Lemon Hearts I liked that one almost as much as the one with the lacy trim and all the embroidered cuffs!  
    Noteworthy That was a nice one too! 
    Sweetie Belle  Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses?! 
    Crowd  
    Sweetie Belle  

    Fluttershy All of this is one headpiece? 
    Rarity Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'.  Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax! 
     
    Rarity Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right? 
    Sweetie Belle Not even close. 
    Rarity Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you? 
    Sweetie Belle No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash Huh? 
    Fluttershy Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, sure do feel like relaxing! 
    Applejack Right behind ya! 
    Sweetie Belle How could you?! "Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!" 
     
    Rarity Oh, so they did like them.  You had me worried, you silly filly. 
    Sweetie Belle There! I knew it! You did this on purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth birthday party all over again! 
    Rarity The... the what now? 
    Sweetie Belle Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?! 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then-- 
    Sweetie Belle Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose! 
    Rarity I thought they were supposed to be good. 
    Sweetie Belle Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing! 
    Rarity I only tried to do what I thought you wanted. 
    Sweetie Belle Ha! 
     

    Sweetie Belle Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I put up with all week long!  For Pete's sake, it's all red! 
    Rarity  I should probably go talk to her, hm? 
    Sweetie Belle  At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like "Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!" 
    Rarity Perhaps waiting would be best. 

     
    Sweetie Belle Ughhh! Hgh, hgh, hgh! Nnngh!  

     
    Sweetie Belle  I wish there was a way I could take back all the work I did! 
    Rarity  
    Sweetie Belle Even better.  

     
     
    Sweetie Belle  Now what? 
     
    Eclair CrÃ¨me And the winner of the "Best Writer, Director, Actor in an Awesome Play Put on by a Pony and Her Awesome Best Friends" goes to... 
    "Star Gazer" Sweetie Belle! 
     
     
     
     
     
    Sweetie Belle Don't go! 
    Rarity  
    Sweetie Belle Stop! Why do you have to ruin everything?! 
    Rarity  
    Princess Luna Enough! 
    Rarity  
    Sweetie Belle Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming? 
    Princess Luna What do you think? 
    Sweetie Belle Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming. 
    Princess Luna I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this, I have struggled. 
    Sweetie Belle Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna! 
     
     
    Sweetie Belle I remember this. This is my fifth birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all beautiful, just like my big sister. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me. 
     
    Sweetie Belle And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was... 
    "Mint Flower" These party favors are the coolest!  
    Little Pony 2 Awesome! Where did you get these? 
    Rarity Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you? 
     
    Little Pony 2 You're the greatest, Rarity! 
    "Plum Star" Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister? 
    Younger Sweetie Belle  
    Sweetie Belle That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'. 
    Princess Luna But perhaps you didn't have the whole story. 
    Sweetie Belle I thought you said you understood? Luna? 
     
    Little Pony 2 Where's Sweetie Belle? 
    Rarity I'm sure she'll be along in any moment. 
    "Titania"  I'm tired of waiting. I say we get out of here before we all keel over from boredom. Who's with me? Poor Sweetie Belle. Nopony's gonna come to another one of her parties after this fiasco. 
    Rarity Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but... 
    "Mint Flower" These party favors are the coolest!  
    Little Pony 2 Awesome? Where did you get these? 
    Rarity Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you? 
     
    "Plum Star" Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister? 
    Younger Sweetie Belle  
    Rarity Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution. 
    Sweetie Belle I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna! 
     
     
    Rarity Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them... 
    Sweetie Belle When was this? 
    Rarity But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression... 
    Sweetie Belle Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight! 
    Rarity Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough? 
    Sweetie Belle Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that. 
    Rarity Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest. 
     
    Sweetie Belle  I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow. 
    Princess Luna Hm. How curious you should say that. 
     
    Princess Luna Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did. 

    Rarity And here it is! The crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me-- 
    Sweetie Belle Noooo! 
    Rarity The piÃ©ce de resistance... 
    Sweetie Belle Don't!  
    Backup dancers  
    Rarity The headdress! 
    Sapphire Shores Looks like I made a mistake here. 
    Rarity But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened! 
    Sapphire Shores You sure about that, honey? 
    Rarity Please, you must believe me! 
    Sweetie Belle Listen to my sister! 
    Sapphire Shores and Backup dancers  
    Rarity  
    Sweetie Belle  I don't wanna see any more! 
    Rarity Always check and recheck! 
    Sapphire Shores Who all wants to hear a funny story about my ex-costume designer? 
     
    Rarity Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck! 
    Sweetie Belle Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?! 
    Fluttershy Make me a dress, Rarity, please? 
    Rarity Go away! You know I don't do that anymore! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Wake me up, Princess Luna, wake me up, wake me uuuup! 

    Sweetie Belle  
     
    Sweetie Belle Rarity?  Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot! 

     
    Sweetie Belle The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing. 
    Scootaloo If we're not too late already. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs! 
    Scootaloo 'Get Your Pony On'! 
    Apple Bloom Ooh, that's one of my favorites! 
    Sweetie Belle This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future! 
    Scootaloo 'Serves Her Right'! 
    Sweetie Belle  How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all! 
    Scootaloo No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs! 
    Apple Bloom You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?! 
    Sweetie Belle ...I prefer show tunes. 
    Scootaloo and Apple Bloom Ugh. 

     
    Sapphire Shores Five, six, seven eight, ba-bam! 
    Rarity Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique! 
    Sapphire Shores One more time, from the top. Let's not embarrass me in front of my favorite designer this time? And a-one, two, three, four! 

    Sweetie Belle But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us! 
    Security guard Kid, the only thing I have to do is make sure Sapphire Shores doesn't get interrupted all day by fans like you. 
    Sweetie Belle But I'm not a fan! 
    Apple Bloom I am! 
    Scootaloo Me too! 
    Sweetie Belle Not helping! 

    Backup dancers  
    Sapphire Shores Now, that's how I like it! You rocked it, girls! Get some water and be back in ten. Rar-i-ty, come on up here and show me what you brought me. Sapphire wants to see it and love it! 

    Scootaloo  Almost... 
     
    Scootaloo Oof! 
    Sweetie Belle We've gotta get in there, now! 

    Sapphire Shores Okay then. Liking what I see so far. So is this the whole shebang? 
    Rarity Actually, I saved the best for last! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Rarity And here it is! 
     
    Sweetie Belle You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it! 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle?! 
    Sapphire Shores You know her? 
    Rarity Uh...  Ahem. Just a moment! 
     
     
     
    Sweetie Belle Oh, good! This is just a dream! 
    Princess Luna Actually, no. This is very much real. 
    Sweetie Belle  Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do? 
    Princess Luna Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it. 

     
    Rarity I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me? 
    Sweetie Belle Actually, I do. I was upset at you for stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart. 
    Rarity What?! 
    Sweetie Belle But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me. 
    Rarity Wait... what is this? 
    Sweetie Belle Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it. 

    Sapphire Shores Rarity, this isn't going to work out. You don't get to my level of success without learning to read the signs, and this situation has bad luck written all over it. 
    Rarity I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it. 
    Sapphire Shores My, it is attractive, but... 
    Sweetie Belle Look at the stitching, real close. 
    Sapphire Shores Well, I'll be. It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams. 
    Rarity Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin? 
    Sweetie Belle Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help. 
    Rarity Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance? 
    Sweetie Belle Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part. 
    Rarity Awww! 

     

Leap of Faith

     
    Apple Bloom Just one more time? Please? 
    Applejack Alright, but this is the last one. 
    Apple Bloom Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo! 
     
    Granny Smith  Who done that?! 
    Apple Bloom Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny. 
    Granny Smith Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole. 
    Apple Bloom How come? 
    Granny Smith Well, I wasn't always this way... 
     
    Granny Smith Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could even look at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough to stay afloat. 
     
    Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water? 
     
    Apple Bloom Aah! 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Applejack and Big McIntosh  

     

    Apple Bloom Wow, Granny. I can't believe you were a high diver! 
    Granny Smith The best one in Ponyville! 
    Apple Bloom Do you think I could be a high diver? 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Applejack Absolutely not. 
    Apple Bloom Butâ€“ 
    Granny Smith Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous! 
    Apple Bloom I know, butâ€“ 
    Granny Smith But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest, darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through the air to the Pegasi. 
    Apple Bloom Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun. 
     
    Applejack Wow. I wonder where everypony's headed. 
     
    Applejack Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'? 
    Granny Smith Aw, quit bein' such a worry-worm and follow your ears! 
    Apple Bloom Come on, Applejack, aren't you curious?

    Flam A phenomenon? What's that?

        Just come on up, we've always got some more 
        Of the Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic 

    

        I won't need these crutches to dance out the door 

    Granny Smith Now how do ya like that? 
    Applejack I don't. There's somethin' funny about this whole thing. 

    

        Now some of you may suffer from feelings of despair 
        You're old, you're tired, your legs won't work, there's graying in your hair 

    

        Just listen and I'll tell you that you don't need to fear

    Flim It cures the reins, the spurs, and the Clydesdale fur blight. 
    Flam Hooferia and horsentery cured in just a night. 
    Flim You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle-bit cleft.

    Flim Mane loss, hay fever, or terrible tonsillitis. 
    Flam You heard it here, folks -- this is the only place in all of Equestria you'll find it! 

    

        It can make you shorter, taller, or even grow old 

    

        But who'd want that? 

    

        When with one drink 

    

        You can be young againâ€“ 

    Granny Smith SOLD! 

    Flim Congratulations, Granny Smith! You just made the purchase of a lifetime! 
    Applejack Are you as worried as I am? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

     
    Apple Bloom Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do! 
    Applejack When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is. 
    Apple Bloom You mean Granny wasted her money? 
    Applejack Well, I don't know about that, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again. 
    Granny Smith Howdy! 
    Apple Bloom Granny?! 
    Applejack Hang on now! We'll get ya! 
     
    Applejack  
     
    Apple Bloom Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?! 
    Granny Smith Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic! 
    Applejack I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'. 
    Granny Smith Doesn't do anythin'?! What d'you call this?  
    Applejack I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic? 
    Granny Smith I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'? 
    Big McIntosh Uh, no. 
    Granny Smith Oh, quit your bellyachin'! 
    Apple Bloom Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it. 
    Applejack I think maybe it's time we found out. 

     
    Apple Bloom So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works? 
    Applejack I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe. 

    

        â€“out the door! 

    Apple Bloom Wait a second! That's that same pony from before! 
    Applejack Hey! 
     
    Applejack Now hold it right there, Mister...? 
    Silver Shill Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want? 
    Applejack Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works. 
    Apple Bloom Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now you can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all... 
    Silver Shill  
    Applejack ...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya? 
    Silver Shill I, uh... 
     
    Applejack Hey! Huh? 
    Flim Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple! 
    Flam What brings you back to our humble abode? 
    Applejack You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again. 
    Flim What's so bad about that? 
    Applejack If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured! 
    Flam Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation. 
    Flim But let's say that it's true... 
    Flam Hypothetically... 
    Flim Theoretically... 
    Flam As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony. 
    Flim The star of the show, once upon a time. 
    Flam But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since. 
    Applejack Until today, that's right. 
    Flim Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves... 
    Flam Hypothetically... 
    Flim Theoretically... 
    Flam The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it. 
    Applejack I guess... 
    Flim So, the question is... 
    Flam Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away? 
    Applejack I... 
    Apple Bloom There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic? 
    Applejack Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters. 
    Apple Bloom Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis. 
    Flim That's the spirit! 
    Flam Come back anytime! 

     
    Apple Bloom Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water? 
    Granny Smith I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way! 
    Applejack Granny, wait! 
    Granny Smith Woo-hoo-hoo! 
    Apple Bloom and Granny Smith  
    Granny Smith Uh, what were you sayin', dear? 
    Applejack Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy? 
    Granny Smith I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to! 
     
    Apple Bloom Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you? 
    Granny Smith Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it! 
    Apple Bloom Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win! 
    Granny Smith Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color. 
    Apple Bloom Oh. Okay. 
    Applejack I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all. 
    Granny Smith Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic! 

     
    Flam Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes! 
    Flim But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush? 
    Flam Right this way, good sir! 
    Granny Smith We'll take the whole case! 
     
    "Jinx" Are you saying this stuff actually works? 
    Applejack It seems to work for Granny. 
    Flim You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved! 
    "Jinx" If Applejack says it works, that's good enough for me! 
     
     

     
     
     
    Apple Bloom and Granny Smith Hoo-ha, hee-hee, ha-hoo-ha! 
    Applejack Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right? 
    Granny Smith Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing! 
    Applejack Uh... good luck, then! 
    Granny Smith Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side! 
    Flam Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic! 
    Flim Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it â€“ why shouldn't you? 
     
    Applejack  Right. 
    Granny Smith Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do! 
     
     
    Applejack Well, I'll be... 
     
    Snappy Scoop That was some of the most amazing aquabatics I've ever seen! How in Equestria did you do it? Hard work? Lots of practice?  
    Granny Smith Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic! 
    Flim That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise. 
    Flam Buy it now while supplies last. 
     
    Applejack What are you doin' here? 
    Silver Shill Oh, things are going so well, Flim and Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more costumes for this pony.  This is more of a uniform. 
    Applejack If you say so. 
    Silver Shill I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty isn't the best policy. 
    Applejack Thanks to... me? 
    Apple Bloom With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack! 
     
    Applejack No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen? 
    Silver Shill Maybe something like that? 
    Applejack  Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?! 
    Apple Bloom Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record! 
    Applejack Land sakes! 
    Granny Smith  
    Applejack  
     
    Granny Smith  Now what in tarnation did you do that for?! 
    Applejack That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that! 
    Granny Smith Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high! 
    Flim Twenty times, by my count. 
    Flam Thirty, with a favorable breeze. 
    Applejack I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake! 
     
    "Jinx" But you gave it your stamp of approval! 
    Rainbowshine Are you saying you lied? 
    Applejack ...I am. 
     
    Applejack I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope with time, I can win back everypony's trust. 
    Apple Bloom But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did? 
    Applejack I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong! 
    Flim But you just said it boosts confidence! 
    Flam And that's not all it does, folksâ€“ 
    Silver Shill Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies believe in a thing that just wasn't so! 
    Applejack Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble. 
    Silver Shill Thank you, Applejack. I got this through dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the truth. 
    Applejack I don't know... 
    Silver Shill Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest. 
    Applejack I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'. 
    Granny Smith Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go? 

    Applejack Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that â€“ but I sure ain't one of them. Now you take it easy there, Granny! 
    Granny Smith Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee! 
     
    Apple Bloom  

     

Testing Testing 1, 2, 3

    Twilight Sparkle  The magical properties of this spell will only have lasting effects if you focus onâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah!  
    Twilight Sparkle No! Rainbow Dash!  How in Equestria does that pony expect to pass her history of the Wonderbolts exam tomorrow if she's wasting time flying?! I'm just gonna fly right up to her and tell her what I think about her lackadaisical approach to studying! Won't she be surprised! 
    Rainbow Dash Surprise! 
    Twilight Sparkle What? Huh? How did youâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Puh-lease, Twilight. That was the worst sneak attack ever. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wha? Butâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash I saw you giving me the stink-eye from the ground and heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, if you heard me "muttering", then you must know what I was "muttering" about. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, yeah, the Wonderbolts history test. No big deal. 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Big deal. Really big deal. It's a test! A test that will determine if you can join the newly-formed Wonderbolts Reserves, and being part of the Wonderbolts Reserves means you'll have the opportunity to live your dream as a Wonderbolt! This is the most important test of your life! 
    Rainbow Dash Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you. 
    Twilight Sparkle I do not get "all freaked out" about tests! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, seriously? Your freakouts are so epic, you sing whole freakout arias about freaking out. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fine, I may tend to take my tests a little seriously, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be studying for yours! Oooh! And I know just the pony who can help you me! This is gonna be so much fun! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Sure. Fun. 

     

     
    Rainbow Dash  Whaâ€“ huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is the most completeâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash And ginormous! 
    Twilight Sparkle â€”book on the history of the Wonderbolts. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, but how am I supposed to get what's in there into here? 
    Twilight Sparkle With my handy-dandy study checklist, of course! 
    Rainbow Dash Of course. 
    Twilight Sparkle First up, reading and highlighting. Reading and highlighting is the foundation of any good study method. It allows the student to hone in and boil down on what's really important, separating the good from the bad, the wheat from the chaff, getting to the crux of things. Let's see what you've got so far! 
    Rainbow Dash Um... 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? Hm, by highlighting everything, you don't really separate the wheat from the chaff... Or the good from the bad. Hey, I am not that tall! 
    Rainbow Dash  

    Twilight Sparkle  Okay, Rainbow, clearly reading and highlighting is not your style of studying, so let's move on to the tried and true History lecture! Yes, Rainbow? 
    Rainbow Dash Is it snack time? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. 
    Rainbow Dash Recess? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. 
    Rainbow Dash  Can't we just watch the history of the Wonderbolts movie?! 
    Twilight Sparkle No! Now, just get comfortable, and experience the magic of learning. Ahem. Prior to the great Celestia/Luna rift, there was no need for the Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi, or E.U.P., Guard. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Twilight Sparkle But after Luna's banishment, the Protective Pony Platoons were formed. On the anniversary of the first Celestial year of peace, a celebration was held. 
     
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Headed by General Firefly, an elite team of aerial performers were chosen to help celebrate this auspicious occasion. The first performance was so full of energy, so highly charged, that magical lightning showered down on the crowd. Everypony was so filled with amazement and wonder that General Firefly dubbed them "the Wonderbolts"! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, can you repeat any of my lesson? 
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     

    Twilight Sparkle History lecture... nope.  Okay, Rainbowâ€“ Rainbow? Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Here! 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's move on to my favorite style of learning flashcards! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, does that mean I'll learn in a flash? 
    Twilight Sparkle One can only hope.  Colonel Purple Dart, the leader of the Wonderbolts in the Fourth Celestial Era, was known for hisâ€“ wha?! Rainbow! Did you see what happened? 
    Rainbow Dash What? No! I was... riveted by your captivating cards! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... After becoming the official flying squadron for Princess Celestia, she honored them withâ€“ Gotcha! 
    Rainbow Dash Got what? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The original Wonderbolts lightning bolt insignia wasâ€“  Rainbow Dash, you could've hurt me! 
    Rainbow Dash With a spit wad? Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle A spit wad to the eye would have been no laughing matter! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, if you can horse around like this, then you clearly must be ready for the test. 
    Rainbow Dash Clearly. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well then, I guess you're also ready for a... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pop quiz! 
    Rainbow Dash Bring it! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The initials E.U.P. stand for what? 
    Rainbow Dash Ernie's undercooked pancakes. 
    Twilight Sparkle The original aerial team performed for...? 
    Rainbow Dash Celestia's cereal celebration. 
    Twilight Sparkle The Wonderbolts were given their name by this famous Pegasus. Who is she?  Please don't say Colonel Waffle... 
    Rainbow Dash Hello? General Blazing Donut Glaze!  So, did I ace it or what? 
    Twilight Sparkle Or what. You didn't get one answer correct. 
    Rainbow Dash What? Butâ€“ but how? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know. I've never heard answers so wrong! And so breakfast-related! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle If you had taken the official test today... 
    Rainbow Dash  What am I gonna do? I'm running out of time! I don't know any of this history! I'm gonna fail! 

     
    Rainbow Dash I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail! And it's all your fault! 
    Twilight Sparkle My fault?! I'm the one helping you! 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe your famous study methods aren't all they're cracked up to be, eh, teacher?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Excuse me, I've used them to study for many a test and passed! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Do you know the name of the premiere Wonderbolts choreographer? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, wellâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Commander Easyglider. Do you know how many Pegasi flew in the original squad? 
    Rainbow Dash Umâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Seven! Do you know Princess Celestia's favorite flight pattern?! The Icaranian Sun Salutation! See? I could pass the test. 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! Rub it in, why don't ya? Besides, I don't see why I have to take this lousy test anyway. I've proven I'm one of the best flyers around. 
    Twilight Sparkle Knowing their origin and being able to properly represent them for all of Equestria is just as important. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, right. Some history buff like you must have made that up to bring us flyers down. 
    Twilight Sparkle Knowing history actually is beneficial, Rainbow. 
    Rainbow Dash  Beneficial for eggheads! 
    Fluttershy Girls. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, this egghead knows history and can fly. Maybe I should become a Wonderbolt. 
    Rainbow Dash Just 'cause you've got wings, doesn't mean you can fly! 
    Fluttershy Girls! 
    Rainbow Dash You're barely able to just get off the ground! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy Girls! Stop! Now, is that any way to talk to a friend? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, sorry. 
    Fluttershy Don't you have more important things to do? Like prepare Rainbow for her big test? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've tried everything, Fluttershy, but none of my study methods work for her. 
    Fluttershy Well, no offense to your teaching methods, Twilight, but I think I may have a way to help Rainbow. 

    Rainbow Dash Oh, who's that, who's that? 
    Fluttershy Celestia and Luna, back when they were happy. 
    Opalescence  
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh... now what? 
    Fluttershy Gummy's an Earth pony, Winona's a unicorn, and Tank is a Pegasus. 
    Twilight Sparkle They're the E.U.P., helping to protect the Princess. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, how are you getting all this? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Stop, stop, stop! That was awâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Awesome! I give it three woohoo's! Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo! And an extra "woo" for good measure! Woo! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I give it a "whoa, whoa, what?" I'm totally confused and I just wanna go home... Whoaâ€“ hey! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa your woes there, woeful. Some ponies learn through theatrical presentation, but other ponies learn through musical intervention. 

    

         
        Well, back in ancient times, there were the Wonderbolts of old 
        A general named Firefly, amazing and so... 

    

        Bold! 

    

        She brought them all together, spreading unity... 

    

        In flight! 

    

        Performing at their very best with wonder... 

    

        And with might! 

    

        There's Admiral Fairweather and the Colonel Purple... 

    

        Dart! 

    

        Gave Wonderbolts a bit of steel along with... 

    

        Lots of heart! 

    

        An admiral named Fairy Flight and general called... 

    

        Flash! 

    

        Helped the 'bolts fly super high... 

    

        With style and panache! 

    

        Commander Easyglider was the real cream of... 

    

        The crop! 

    

        For with her wicked moves, the Wonderbolts... 

    

        Soared to the top! 

    

        Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts... 

    

        Huh! 

    

        Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts... 

    

        Unh! 

    

        That is my rappin' history of the Wonderbolts! 

    Pinkie Pie So, d'you get it? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, Pinkie Pie!  General This and Colonel That, they're the Wonderbolts, something that rhymes with that! 
    Pinkie Pie That... was pretty terrible. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! No... really? But I've gotta learn this stuff! Now! 
    Rarity And I am just the pony to help! 
    Rainbow Dash Rarity, you look ridiculous. 
    Rarity I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you. 
    Rainbow Dash Good luck. 

    Rarity Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion! I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking? 
    Pinkie Pie I dunno. I bet General Flash rocked these thangs! 
    Rainbow Dash  Pinkie, you're real! 
    Pinkie Pie Of course I'm real! I mean I'm not the real General Flash, the tenth leader of the Wonderbolts, but I, Pinkie, am really real. 
    Fluttershy And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight, from the seventh squadron. 
    Twilight Sparkle And of course you recognize Commander Easyglider. 
    Applejack And I'm sportin' some sort of getup worn by Colonel Purple Dart. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Just look at us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Look at us. 
    Pinkie Pie Look at me! 
    Rainbow Dash It's too much for my eyes! 
    Applejack Now, don't you fret, Rainbow. This fashion show nonsense wouldn't help me learn nothin', either. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Really? Well, what special study trick do you have, AJ? 
    Applejack Who, me? Oh, I got nothing. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Why, I could tell you every little thing there is to know about the history of apples, but I picked all that up over years in the field as a labor of love. How much time you got? 
    Rainbow Dash Twelve hours. 
    Applejack Oh, then you are up a creek. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I think we should just go back to old-fashioned studying. 
    Fluttershy What about our play? 
    Rarity Just look at these costumes! Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt! 
    Applejack And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly! 

    

        Commander Easyglider was the real cream of the cropâ€” 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, stop rapping! That isn't gonna help Rainbow! 

    

        Well, I suggest you put down your silly cards of flash, 
        For I know that they cannot help our good friend Rainbow Dash! 

    Main cast sans Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash Enough! No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples! I am never gonna pass this test, ever! Just forget it! 

    Twilight Sparkle  Rainbow, I'm sorry about all that! We didn't mean to overwhelm you! 
    Rainbow Dash It's okay. You were just trying to help. It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything. 
    Twilight Sparkle You are not dumb! You just learn differently! 
    Rainbow Dash If by "differently" you mean "not at all", then you're totally right. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, that's totally wrong. 
    Rainbow Dash See? Wrong again. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know anypony that's read more Daring Do books than you. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts. 
    Twilight Sparkle And your knowledge of jokes and pranks is only rivaled by Pinkie. 
    Rainbow Dash Great. My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not what I meant. You're smart, creative, inventive, andâ€“ ugh! Hey! I know you're upset, but you don't need toâ€” 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa... I almost slammed into that! 
    Rainbow Dash I know. You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice. 
    Twilight Sparkle But how did you notice? You were listening and talking to me the whole time! 
    Rainbow Dash Ha-hah, you're such a rookie. An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask. 
    Twilight Sparkle While you fly? 
    Rainbow Dash It's essential! Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Rainbow Dash Flying's not just flying! 
     
    Rainbow Dash In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details. For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles. And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very heartyâ€” 
    Big McIntosh and Rainbow Dash "Eeyup". 
    Rainbow Dash I always make note of everything when I fly. No biggie. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, my gosh! 
    Rainbow Dash What? 
    Twilight Sparkle Gotta go! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't want to hang out with a loser like me either.  
     

    Twilight Sparkle Thanks for meeting me, everypony. 
    Applejack What is it, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle We have to help Rainbow Dash. 
     
    Fluttershy Yes, but how? 
    Rarity We've tried every kind of studying. My way, your way... 
    Twilight Sparkle But we haven't tried Rainbow Dash's way. 
    Pinkie Pie Hmm, I'm intrigued. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. Listen up, ponies, here's the plan.  

    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Rainbow. Wanna go for a fly? 
    Rainbow Dash  Sure. Got nothing better to do. Didn't we just do this? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but like you said, I'm such a newbie, I need all the practice I can get. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time. After all, you're good at everything. 
    Twilight Sparkle So... what's going on? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, nothing. Just getting my dreams crushed. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh... read any good books lately? 
    Rainbow Dash  Just history books. I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock. 
    Twilight Sparkle Speaking of rocks, did you know Pinkie Pie grew up on a rock farm?  
    Rainbow Dash Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, come on now, Rainbow. You can't give up on your dream! 
    Rainbow Dash Seems my dream has given up on me. Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches... 
    Twilight Sparkle Or maybe you'll be a Wonderbolt. 
    Rainbow Dash Twilight, give it up! I have. 
    Twilight Sparkle So, what do you remember about that flight? 
    Rainbow Dash  Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes...? 
    Rainbow Dash  And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh...? 
    Rainbow Dash Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes! 
    Rainbow Dash I... I know the history! I know it all! But how in Equestria did that happen? 
    Twilight Sparkle You learned it! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I got that! But how? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, on our first flight, I discovered that you catalog everything that happens all around you when you're flying, without even thinking about it! Don't you see? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony to help you learn the history of the Wonderbolts! 

    Fluttershy I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon. 
    Rarity Noooooo! 
    Apple Bloom Earth! 
    Sweetie Belle Unicorn! 
    Scootaloo Pegasus! 
    Apple Bloom E! 
    Sweetie Belle U! 
    Scootaloo P! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Fluttershy Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, let's party! I'm General Firefly! Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I'll call them... the Wonderbolts! 
    Rarity Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare! 
    S04E21 Unnamed Pegasus Stallion #1 Admiral Fairweather! 
    "Downdraft" Colonel Purple Dart! 
    Sassaflash Admiral Fairy Flight! 
    S04E21 Unnamed Pegasus Stallion #2 General Flash! 
    "High Note" Commander Easyglider! 
    Fluttershy The history of the Wonderbolts! 

    Rainbow Dash Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Thank you! Thank you all so much! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're welcome, but it all came from you. You learned without knowing you're learning. Your main focus is flying, but then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information! It's actually really brilliant! 
    Rainbow Dash Ha, I always knew I was brilliant! 
    Main cast  

    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts, but she's not the only pony that needed a lesson; I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeeeaah! Whoo! 

     

Trade Ya!

    Pinkie Pie  Yes! Best day ever! We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange! And not just going â€“ we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty! 
    Twilight Sparkle Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here. 
     
    Crowd Pony 1 Wow, look over there, a princess! 
    Crowd Pony 2 Oh, this is amazing! 
    Applejack Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness! 
    Rarity You said it. The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine. You can get anything you want here! 
    Applejack If'n you got the goods to trade for it. 
    Spike  Wha? Nooo! Thanks, Twilight. Whew. One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore. And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic. 
     
    Applejack I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle But all I'm supposed to do is settle disagreements over whether a trade is fair or not. And since the rule is that a trade is fair as long as both ponies get what they want, there's never been a disagreement. So there's really no reason for anypony to treat me as anything special. Hi! Can I help you?  
    Rainbow Dash There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria! 
    Fluttershy Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first... 
    Rainbow Dash Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right. This is really important. I've gotta get that book! 
    Applejack Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls. 
    Rarity Did you say vintage? Why, old and rare items are so in style right now! I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well. I just hope I brought enough to trade. 
    Applejack I know what you mean, Rarity. Hey! Why don't we pool our trade stashes? 
    Rarity Pool? 
    Applejack That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without... 
    Rarity  She'll definitely be able to get it! Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items? Oh, yes! That is absolutely brilliant! I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack. 
    Applejack I feel the same way. 
    Rarity Then let's go shopping! 

    Pinkie Pie Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats? 
    Twilight Sparkle I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing. Ever since I became a princess, Celestia's been sending me more books to read than ever. The library's overflowing, so I figured while we're here, I might as well trade away some books I don't need anymore. 
    Pinkie Pie Mm-hm! 

    Rainbow Dash  Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it My lucky horseshoe! 
    "Teddie Safari" I don't want it. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! 
    "Teddie Safari" It's just a rusty old horseshoe. That's not worth anything to me. 
    Fluttershy But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants? 
    "Teddie Safari" Well, she's not. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    "Teddie Safari" Unless... she can get me that. 
     
    Fluttershy Aww, an Orthros! How cute! 
    "Teddie Safari" The pony running the ancient beasts stall doesn't want anything I've got. But if you can get me the Orthros, I'll trade you the book for it. 
    Rainbow Dash You got it!  I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros. 

    Rarity Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you. 
    Applejack Me too! You're not gonna believe it! 
    Applejack and Rarity  Uh-oh. 

    Rarity So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for? 
    Applejack There! 
    Rarity Where? 
    Applejack Right there! 
    Rarity But... that's a dented old pie tin. 
    Applejack A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore! 
    Rarity I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling... 
     
    Rarity ...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that.  Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind! 
    Applejack It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'. 
    Rarity Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine! 
    Applejack But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference! 
    Rarity Oh, don't be silly, of course I would! 
     
    Applejack So which is the vintage one? 
    Rarity That one, of course. 
    Applejack Hah, you're bluffin'! 
    Rarity Am I? How can you tell? 
    Applejack Well... because...  I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference! 
    Rarity I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster! 
    Applejack It's five seconds faster! 
    Rarity  
    Applejack  

     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Fluttershy Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are! 
     
    Cratus Stop that! C'mon, don't you start now, too! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that. 
    Cratus Nope. 
    Rainbow Dash Aww. 
    Cratus Down, boy! Watch out for the lamp! 
     
    Cratus Well, I could use another lamp. 

    Rainbow Dash A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps? Seriously?! 
    Fluttershy They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange. 
    Rainbow Dash Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book? 
    Stellar Eclipse No. But I'd trade it for an antique chicken. 
    Rainbow Dash Great!  What's an antique chicken? 

    "Match Game" Oh, I got all kinds of antique chicken statues. I got your blue hens, speckled grays, your- 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, cool! So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book? 
    "Match Game" Well, lemme think... Uh, no. 
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Aww. 
    "Match Game" But I'd gladly trade one of my chickens for a crystal chalice. 

    Rainbow Dash  We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros. So what are you willing to trade for it? I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange. 
    "Amethyst Gleam" Actually, I could use a slightly rusty old horseshoe. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, like where am I gonna findâ€“ wait, I've got one of those! Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch! 
    Fluttershy Do you really think so? 
    Rainbow Dash All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we areâ€“ 
     
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash  

    Twilight Sparkle You want me to trade all my books for a broken pen? Alright, fine. You got yourself aâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Stop! What are you doing?! 
    Twilight Sparkle I was trying to get rid of all the books I don't need anymore. 
    Pinkie Pie For that? Do you reaaaaally want that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, not really, but I'm running out of library space, soâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh! I can't believe that almost happened! But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me. 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you talking about? 
    Pinkie Pie According to the rules of the Exchange, a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want. You can't break the rules! Did anypony see you do it? I don't think anypony saw!  
    Twilight Sparkle Y'know, if you want to go check out the rest of the Exchange and trade whatever you brought... 
    Pinkie Pie Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Rainbow Dash Well, that took forever. 
    Fluttershy I just hope it looks okay. 
    "Match Game" This is perfect! 
     
    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash  
    "Match Game" Perfect for the broken chalice mosaic I'm making! Alright, so what kind of antique chicken do you want? I got speckled, brown, gray...  
    Rainbow Dash Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay? 
    Fluttershy Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think.  Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to... 
    Rainbow Dash  Beat it! You go. I'll stay here. 

    Rarity Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want. 
    Applejack I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash. 
    Rarity How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you think I am? You are going to get what you want! 
    Applejack No, you are! 
    Rarity No, you are! 

    Rainbow Dash Hello!  

    Pinkie Pie These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing â€“ a big, fat zero! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! 
    Pinkie Pie Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else! 
    Pinkie Pie  Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia? 
    "Fleur de Verre" Whoa, wait, you don't meanâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, that's right! Double princess! 
     

    Fluttershy There he is! 
    Rainbow Dash Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp! 
    Stellar Eclipse  Sorry, girls. Been trading all day. My belly's tellin' me it's time to eat an oatburger. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh come on, please? 
    Fluttershy Pretty pretty please? 
    Stellar Eclipse Sorry, belly says 'no'. 
    Rainbow Dash But the Exchange ends at sundown! 
    Stellar Eclipse No! 
    Rainbow Dash I've got an idea. Next! Next! Next! Next! Next! 

    Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash  
    Rainbow Dash We're home free! 
     
    Rainbow Dash As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber. 
    Fluttershy Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow. Aren't you, little boy? 

    Applejack No, I insist. You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am. 
    Rarity Well! I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that! 

    Rainbow Dash We gotta hurry!  We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Come on! 
    Fluttershy My bear call! 
    Rainbow Dash We gotta go! 
    Fluttershy Of course. It's just a bear call. There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you. 
    Rainbow Dash  Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it. We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken... 
    Fluttershy And the chicken for a lamp... 
    Rainbow Dash And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked. 
     
    Rainbow Dash So there you go! Now where's my book? 
    "Teddie Safari" Yeah, you know, the thing is... I don't really want an Orthros anymore. 
    Fluttershy But... what do we do now? 
    Rainbow Dash  
     

     
    Fluttershy Oh goodness, oh goodness! 
    Rainbow Dash Argh! Ugh... 
    Fluttershy Good boy! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros! 
    "Teddie Safari" I've been watching that thing over at the ancient beast booth! It's crazy! I don't want one in my house! 
     
    Fluttershy There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet. 
    "Teddie Safari"  All right, all right. I'll trade you. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! 
    "Teddie Safari" If she comes and stays with us in Manehattan until it's trained! 
    Fluttershy Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want... 
    "Teddie Safari" So we got a fair deal? 
    Rainbow Dash Of course it's a deal! Yeah-eah, whoo!  I did it, I did it! Fluttershy, can you believe it? Oh no. what did I do?! 
    Pinkie Pie Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia? Did I say "princess"? 
    Minuette Over here, over here! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks funâ€“ but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them? 
    Crowd Pony 3 Well, when you put it like that... 
    Crowd  
    Pinkie Pie Wait, stop, come back! Uh, these books aren't that great...  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, yes, they are. 
    Pinkie Pie But I thought you wanted to get rid of them! 
    Twilight Sparkle None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it â€“ which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie I told you I'd take care of everything! 
    Rainbow Dash Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast! 

    Twilight Sparkle I've heard what you both have to say, and I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but my hooves are tied. You said it was a fair trade. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair! 
    "Teddi Safari" Oh, come on, that's... the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Okay, the trade's off! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And with that, I declare this trial, and this year's Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange, over!  
    Pinkie Pie  Woo-hoo! 

    Rarity I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get. 
    Applejack Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this! 
    Rarity Ohhh! 
    Applejack And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, where's your double-doggie? 
    Rainbow Dash I traded it for something way better. 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, what do you know? My copy of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue. It's just a beat up old paperback, not a one-of-a-kind first edition... 
    Rainbow Dash  Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

Inspiration Manifestation

    Pinkie Pie Hear ye, hear ye! The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee, ha-ha, whoa!  
     

    Rarity Just because the attendees are young, doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work. Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair! 
    Spike How could it not be?  You're the one making it... 
    Rarity Oh! But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends! You are my favorite dragon. 
    Spike Your favorite dragon? Aw, gee... 
    Rarity The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words! 

    Claude This is awful! 
    Rarity Awful?! 
    Claude And completely unusable. Hmmm... Ugh! It doesn't travel! Oh, there's no room for my puppets! It appears I won't have a traveling puppet theater to use after all. 
    Spike I don't know what that guy was talking about. This thing is perfect! 

     

    Rarity This is terrible, simply terrible!  
    Spike So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater.  You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair. 
    Rarity  

    Spike Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere. 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike It's not "who", it's "what"! Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair? She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution. She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need. There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick. 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Come on, help a dragon out! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Ugh! It's not for me! It's for Rarity! The one who made you that bow tie you like so much? 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Okay, I get it. 
     
    Spike You don't think we should use magicâ€“ What is that? 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike  
    Owlowiscious  
     
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike What? If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get. And it's covered in spikes, like me. 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike "Inspiration Manifestation Instantly brings ideas to life." 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike I'm likin' the looks of this one. Hmmm. 

    Rarity  
    Spike Rarity! 
    Rarity Leave me be! Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am? 
    Spike But I brought you something. 
    Rarity Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested. 
    Spike It's magic! 
    Rarity Spike, precious scales, I already have magic. 
    Spike But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair. This can! 
    Rarity I suppose it's worth a try. "From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action. Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction. Projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free." 
    Spike Did it work? 
    Rarity Hm, there's only one way to find out. 
     
    Rarity  Oh, my! I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have! 
     
    Rarity Dear, dear Spike! Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors! Come! We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined! Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined. 

    Claude Ah, Miss Rarity, come to see the show, I presume? You'll notice I had to make do in light of your recent failure to produce a functioning theater. 
    Rarity Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking! 
    Claude  Ah, well, it is gorgeous, but that was never the problem now, was it? Oh, well, this one does seem to travel. Plenty of room for my puppets... I say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself. How did you manage to do so in such a short time? 
    Spike As a matter of fact, she used a sâ€“ 
    Rarity A good designer never reveals her tricks. 

    Rarity Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me! 
    Spike My pleasure. Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over. 
    Rarity Oh, yes, of course. I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well! Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer... You don't mind, do you, Spike? 
    Spike Of course not! See you tomorrow!  What? She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that. 

     
    Spike  
     
    Spike Rarity? 
     
    Spike Whoa! 
    Rarity Spike, I'm so glad you're here! 
    Spike Whoa! Are... you okay? 
    Rarity Oh, I've never been better! This book you've given me is amazing! Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating! I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons! 
    Spike Wow! 
    Rarity But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'? Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease! You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer? 
    Spike Of course I will! 
    Owlowiscious  

    Spike  What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started? 
    Rarity No time for breakfast! I want to get started right away! 
    Spike Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make thingsâ€“ Rarity? 
    Rarity Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair! 
     
    Granny Smith My eyes playin' tricks on me again? 
    Applejack What in rhubarb pie just happened? 
    Rarity Isn't it gorgeous? 
    Spike It's amazing! You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover! 
    Rarity Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling. Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones! 
    Spike You're right! Everypony does love surprises. 
    Rarity  Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share? 
    Spike The... three of us? 
    Rarity You, me, and the book, of course. My marvelous, marvelous book! 
    Spike ...Of course. 
    Rarity Promise me you won't say a word to anypony? 
    Spike  You got it! 
    Rarity I knew I could count on you, Spike. And I also know just what I want to do next! 

    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash What in the... Get... it... off... me!  
    Rarity I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her! Cloud-busting with style!  Moving on! 
    Spike She'll be fine. It's just a dress. Uh, wait for your favorite dragon! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  

     
    Fluttershy La la-la la-la la-la la la... There you go, Mr. Robin! 
    Mr. Robin  
    Fluttershy Don't you look so content in your little houseâ€“ 
     
    Fluttershy  Oh, my goodness! 
    Mr. Robin  
    Fluttershy You're lost? No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a... bedroom. Try that one over there. No, no, that leads to a... 
     
    Fluttershy Shoe closet? Oh, dear. Maybe try the staircase? Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase. 
    Rarity Isn't it gorgeous? 
    Spike It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created. 
    Rarity Go on. 
    Spike I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it. 
    Rarity Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design? What matters is what you think, Spike. And you love it. Don't you? 
    Spike Of course I do. It's so...  Rarity. 
    Rarity It is, isn't it? Ooh! 
     

     
    Rarity Oh, adorable! But it could use a touch of class, don't you think? 
    Spike Oh yeah, definitely. 
     
    Rarity This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme. Let's do something about that, shall we? 
    Spike You've already made things look really really great. Maybe you should stop while you're ahead? 
    Rarity You're right, Spike! There's so much to do elsewhere! 
    Spike Right! Elsewhere... 
    Rarity Just one more little thing before we go... 
     
    Rarity Why, this party is certain to make the society page now. Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased? 
    Pinkie Pie Happy, happy day toâ€“ huh?! 

    Rarity I am simply buzzing with ideas. Simply buzzing! 
    Spike That's great! But, uh, you've been at this for a while now. How 'bout you take a break? Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest? 
    Rarity Don't be silly! I'm not going to stop now! Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision! Starting with you, Spike! 
     
    Rarity You look fabulous! 
    Spike All because of you, heh... 
    Rarity Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend. Come, there's so much more to do! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh no, not you too! 
    Spike What do you mean, not me too? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Judging by that outfit, I thought for sure you'dâ€“ 
    Spike What? This? I just wanted to try out a new look. 
     
    Spike You like? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around? 
    Spike Uh, nope. 
    Mayor Mare Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike No! I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike  But you're right, Owlowiscious. I have to tell. And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend... I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all... 

    Spike  I can't do it. I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Spike Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book. Butâ€“ The spellbook! Of course! If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore! Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan! I... just have to figure out which way she went. 
    Stallion I can't see! 
     
    Spike I'm thinking she's headed this way. 

    Rarity  What do you think you're doing?! 
    Spike Uh, me? I was just, uh... basking in your creative radiance. 
    Rarity Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things. 
    Spike Thanks. 
    Rarity Now, where was I? Oh yes! Gold-plated rooftops for everypony! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Rarity Spike! 
    Spike  
    Rarity I have just had the most marvelous idea! 
    Spike  Of course you have. You're Rarity. 
    Rarity My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete. Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision? 
    Spike Absolutely! 
    Rarity Ooh, I'm thinking we go by chariot! Or, as everyone will soon be calling them, "Rariot"!  
    Spike Oh, yeah, we should definitely go byâ€“ 
     
    Spike Huh?! How... how did you... do that? 
    Rarity Why, whatever do you mean? 
    Spike The book! It'sâ€“ I meanâ€“ you don'tâ€“ it's gone! The book is gone! 
    Rarity Gone? Why, it's right there.  
    Spike Why would I do anything with your book? We're friends! It... it was probably the owl! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Rarity But, wait... I don't seem to need it anymore, do I? Yes... yes...! I can feel its magic flowing within me now! I'm so excited! I'm so excited! 
    Spike  I'm so scared. 
    Rarity Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius! 
    Spike ...No. 
    Rarity What did you say? 
    Spike I said 'no'. You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better. I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend.  But instead, I let you become something awful. 
    Rarity Awful? 
     
    Rarity Ugh... what happened? 
    Spike Rarity! You're okay? 
    Rarity I... I think so... though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville. 
    Spike You happened. 
    Rarity Me? 
    Spike The last part of the spell! 
    Rarity  Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free. 
    Spike The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria. I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I... I told you the truth. 
    Rarity Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth. We're friends, remember? 

    Spike Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right. A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?! 
    Spike  You don't look so good. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike What? I'm just being honest! It's what good friends do! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

Equestria Games

    Rainbow Dash This just got real! 
     
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle  
     
    Rainbow Dash Listen up, gang! We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say. First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history? 
     
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
    Rainbow Dash And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold! 
     
    Rainbow Dash ...With the possible exception of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy, and me. I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch. Let's not kid ourselves. 
    Scootaloo Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash! We have absolutely no shot at getting gold either! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony. There are no winners. 
    Scootaloo Winners or not, we still have the chance to be awesome! 
    Rainbow Dash That's the spirit! You hear that, everypony? Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome! 
     
    Rainbow Dash But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay? 

     

     
     
    Spike  It's all in there, gang! Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs. 
    Apple Bloom And the Ponyville flag? You sure? And what about the flagpole? 
    Spike In with the portable ramp! Whoa! 
     
    Scootaloo Give it a rest, Apple Bloom. 
    Spike Aw, she's just nervous, that's all. Perfectly understandable. Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick. I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time. Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy! 
     
    Spike Hey! Put me down! 
    Scootaloo What's going on?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Are you all right? 
    Crystal Guard A thousand pardons, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. 
    Spike Huh? Who the what now? 
    Princess Cadance  It's okay, Spike. We'll have our hoofponies go back for your bags. 
    Spike Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first? 

    Spike  More of the green ones, please? I like the green ones. 
    Twilight Sparkle Last time you were here, you got the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance in time to save this entire empire from destruction! 
    Princess Cadance You are known throughout my empire as "Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious". 
    Twilight Sparkle Isn't that awesome? You're a big shot here, Spike! See that? That's you! 
    Spike  Hello, gawgeous! 
    Princess Cadance This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch at the opening ceremony. You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the Equestria Games to do so. 
    Spike Of course I'll do it! And -- bonus -- I can do it with my fire breath!  

     
    Shining Armor Places for the procession, everypony! Two minutes! 
    Pinkie Pie  

    Ms. Harshwhinny And you're quite certain you also understand exactly what you're supposed to do? 
    Spike I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Mm. Couldn't be simpler. 
     
    Spike  
    Ms. Harshwhinny Mr. the Dragon, are you coming?  Would somepony help him walk? 
    Shining Armor Now, please welcome the delegation from Ponyville! 
    Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle Ponyville forever! Yay! 
    Rainbow Dash Awesome! 
    Fluttershy Yay. 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Ms. Harshwhinny  I'm giving you the signal now! Mr. the Dragon! 
    Spike  Come on, Spike! Calm yourself! Count to ten. One... two... three... thousand... fourteen thousand... Twenty thousand...! Thirty thousand...! 
    Princess Cadance What's wrong? 
    Spike  Tell me this isn't happening... 
    Twilight Sparkle Equestria, we have a problem. 

    Spike  
    Ms. Harshwhinny Mr. the Dragon! Would you light the torch already?! 
    Spike I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today! Did you bring a match? 
    Ms. Harshwhinny You're a fire-breathing dragon. 
    Spike  Then some cough drops, maybe? 
    Ms. Harshwhinny  
    Spike Nevermind. I'll keep trying.  
    Princess Cadance Somepony go down and help him! 
    Spike  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Phew! 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Oh! How did you do that? 
    Spike I'm... not sure. 
    Ms. Harshwhinny Oh, well. Better late than never. 
    Shining Armor Let the games begin! 
     

    Rarity Oh! There are our little superstars! You were fabulous! 
    Applejack Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August! 
    Rainbow Dash Ya done good, squirt! 
    Twilight Sparkle You three really were wonderful. But does anypony know what was going on with Spike? 
    Applejack He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there. 
    Rarity He put things right in time, though. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, it was me. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, so I cast a secret spell to light it for him. 
    Rarity Oh, dear. Have you told him? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, but he might have figured it out on his own. 
    Applejack You gotta tell him, just in case. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done. 
    Rainbow Dash Psst, here he comes now! Act casual!  'Sup? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Is everything okay? 
    Spike I guess. I don't know. The weirdest thing happened down there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, about that. Iâ€“ 
    Spike I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit! It was amazing! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, phew! I was afraid you'd be upset. 
    Spike Upset? Are you kidding? Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire... with my mind? 
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle What?! 
    Bright Smile Look, look, it's the Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious! 
    Elbow Grease Can we get your autograph? 
    Spike Sure! 
     
    Bright Smile How you saved our Empire last time you were here was really amazing! 
    Spike Aw. You know what else is amazing? Watch this!  
    Twilight Sparkle  Spike, may I have a word with you a moment? 
    Spike Hey, you'd better be careful with that! It might burst into flames later! Delayed reaction. Hey, Twi, what is it? Hold on, hold on, give me a second... If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner! And I predict that you are about to ask me... to set fire to something with my mind! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, because you can't! 
    Spike Oh, really? So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands ofâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle I did it, Spike. I cast a spell to do it for you. 
    Spike In front of... thousands and... thousands...? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Spike. I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that! You understand, don't you? 
    Spike I... I... I need to be alone right now. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike? 
    "Neighls Bohr" O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious, can I get your autograph? 
    Spike Sorry. You should probably ask somebody special instead. 

     
    Shining Armor Our next event...  ...the aerial relay! 
    Applejack That's Dash and Fluttershy! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, no! We can't be late for that! 
    Security Guard Miss? Step right over here. Unicorns will no longer be admitted without a disabling spell, to prevent cheating. And make sure you don't even try casting a spell, or we'll know it. 
    Rarity Hmph! 

    Pinkie Pie  If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale! Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...! 
    Spike Ms. Harshwhinny? I know you're really busy, but... 
    Ms. Harshwhinny What is it? 
    Spike Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games. Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration? 
    Ms. Harshwhinny What are you talking about? You lit the torch for the whole thing! 
    Spike Uh, well, actually, that wasn't reallyâ€“ 
    Ms. Harshwhinny That wasn't worthy enough for you? Ugh, for pony's sake! Next thing you know, you'll be asking to put on a rock concert.  Celebrities... 
    Spike Wait, that's it! 
     
    Applejack We got silver! 

    Shining Armor Congratulations to all our medalists. And now, the anthem ofâ€“ 
    Spike And I shall do the honor of singing! 
     
    Shining Armor  Spike, what are you doing?! 
    Spike You know how they always just play the music?  Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all! 
     
    Shining Armor And now... um... the Cloudsdale anthem, as sung by... Spike! 
    Spike Wait! The Cloudsdale anthem? 
    Shining Armor  They only play the anthem for the winner, Spike! The Wonderbolts are from Cloudsdale! 
    Spike But... But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem! I've never even heard it! 
    Crystal Pony in Crowd Sing for us, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious! 
    Spike 

        Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast 
        And we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria   
        That we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees 
        Yeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that 
         I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now. 

        Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast and we're cloudâ€“ from Cloudsdale 
        We like it there 'cause it's really nice and the trees are cool and I hope it is over now 
        And... it keeps going on, la la la 
        And we really love the town 
        So I wish that this... song... was over now. 
        Over... now. 
        Over... now. 

     
     
    Pinkie Pie Nailed it! 

    Apple Bloom Spike, you comin'? 
    Spike Nah, I got this stuff to pack up. 
    Scootaloo But you've been moping in here for almost the entire Games. 
    Sweetie Belle And tonight's the closing ceremony! 
    Spike Which means we leave tomorrow. Ergo, the packing. 

     
    Shining Armor And so the Games conclude as they always do, with the ice archery finals! Ice archers, take your places! 
     
    Applejack Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'. We don't have anyone to root for. 
    Pinkie Pie That's okay. Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway! Woo-hoo! 
    Rainbow Dash But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now! If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count! 
    Pinkie Pie So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?! 
    Applejack Pretty much. 
    Pinkie Pie Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! Twilight! Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count! I'll show you how Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, I was looking for Spike. Have you seen him? 
    Apple Bloom He wouldn't come. 
    Sweetie Belle We tried to talk him into it... 
    Scootaloo ...but he wouldn't listen! 
    Pinkie Pie You can have his extra seat, though. Uh... Twi? 

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle You here? 
    Spike  Uh, yeah! I'm super-busy! Look at all this packing left to do, heh. Crazy, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now. 
    Spike Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these? 

     
    Rainbow Dash Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale â€“ he's the favorite. 
    Twilight Sparkle Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself. 
    Spike I let everypony down. Twice. You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals -- no harm, no foul. 
    Spike Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet. 
     
     
     
    Shining Armor No! 
    Princess Celestia and Princess Luna  
    Rainbow Dash Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds! 
    Shining Armor Somepony cut the disabling spell! 
    Security Guard 2 There isn't time! 
    Spike Dash, Fluttershy! Move! 
     
     
     
     

    Rainbow Dash That was awesome! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Princess Cadance I just wanted to thank you personally for saving those ponies and the Games, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. You must be very proud. 
    Spike I guess. 
    All present characters bar Spike You guess?! 
    Spike I just saw what needed to be done and reacted. Just so happens I can breathe fire and... if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same. 
    Applejack Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense. 
    Spike Well, it's just how I feel. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike? 
    Spike Meh, I don't know. Can you turn back time? 'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony. 
    Princess Cadance We can't turn back time, but, would you do me the great honor of lighting fireworks in my place at the closing ceremonies tonight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks. 
    Spike Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot. 
    Main cast  

     
    Pinkie Pie We did it! Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal! 
    Rainbow Dash Hmm, wonder which medal that was? Bam! 
    Applejack How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt? 
    Apple Bloom Probably as good as it feels to close them! 
     
    Ms. Harshwhinny Okay, it's time! 
    Spike You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside.  Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past. That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky. 
     

     

Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1

     
    Spike Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed. Hey, you guys remember that? 
    Rainbow Dash You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here. 
    Rarity  Yes, and we never hear a peep out of you about your exploits. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, point taken. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm glad you all wanted to come, but I don't think it's gonna be that exciting. I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive. 
    Rarity Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess. 
    Applejack How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess? 
    Twilight Sparkle It isn't. 
    Fluttershy What's wrong, Twilight? 
    Pinkie Pie Why the looooooooong face? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much. 
    Applejack That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria. 
    Fluttershy Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so. 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess you're right. 
    Rarity Of course we are. Now hurry along! You don't want to risk having that important role diminished because you were tardy for your regal meet-and-greet. 

     
    Flash Sentry The Duke and Duchess of Maretonia! 
    Spike That was it? Princess Celestia had you come all the way to the Crystal Empire just to do that? I mean, whoa, really regal and important!  
     

     

     
    Duke of Maretonia Your highness. Thank you for understanding our desire to keep the number of those privy to these confidential discussions to a minimum. 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Is there anything else I can do to assist with their visit? 
    Princess Cadance I'm sorry, Twilight, but their visit is already over. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. 
    Princess Luna Something wrong? 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess I just don't really understand why I'm here. Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner? 
    Princess Celestia Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one. 
    Princess Cadance Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favorite sister-in-law. 
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm happy to see you. All of you. 
    Princess Cadance But...? 
    Twilight Sparkle But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave. 
    

        It isn't that I'm ungrateful 
        For all the things that I've earned, 
        For all the journeys I have taken, 
        All the lessons that I have learned 

        But I wonder where I'm going now, 
        What my role is meant to be 
        I don't know how to travel 
        To a future that I can't see 

        I have my wings, I wear this crown 
        I'm a princess, this is true 
        But it's still unclear to me 
        Just what I am meant to do 

        I wanna have a purpose 
        Wanna do all that I can 
        I wanna make a contribution 
        I want to be a part of the plan 

    

        Your destiny's uncertain 
        And that's sometimes hard to take 
        But it will become much clearer 
        With every new choice you make 

    

        Patience is never easy 
        I understand wanting more 
        I know how hard it is to wait 
        To spread out your wings and soar 

    

        But you stand here for a reason 
        You're gifted and you are strong 
        That crown is upon your head because 
        You belong 

    

        Know that your time is coming soon 
        As the sun rises, so does the moon 
        As love finds a place in every heart 
        You are a princess; you'll play your part 

    

        We understand you wanting more 
        A chance to shine, a chance to soar 

    

        Soon will come the day it turns around 

    

        Know that your time is coming soon 
        As the sun rises, so does the moon 
        As love finds a place in every heart 
        You are a princess; you'll play your part 

    

        You are a princess; you'll play your part 

    Princess Celestia Your time will come. 

     
    Lord Tirek  
    Rare Find Very sorry.  You came out of nowhere. 
    Lord Tirek "Is he friend or is he foe?", the pony wonders. I can assure you... I am no friend. I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago.  

    Princess Celestia  
    Princess Luna Sister, are you alright?! 
    Princess Celestia I've just had the most terrible dream. 
    Princess Luna Why do you think I'm here? You know as well as I that this was not a dream, but a vision. 
    Princess Celestia Then we haven't much time. The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger. 

     
    Princess Celestia  Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard. 
    Princess Luna  Scorpan urged his brother to abandon their plans. When Tirek refused, Scorpan alerted us to Tirek's intentions. 
    Princess Celestia  Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape. 
    Princess Luna We believe it happened when Cerberus left his post at the gates. 
    Twilight Sparkle But that was a long time ago. Why is he just now starting to steal magic? 
    Princess Celestia His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers. 
    Princess Luna But with each passing moment, he grows stronger still. 
    Princess Cadance And I know just the princess who can stop him. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. I'll find him andâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord. 
    Twilight Sparkle, Princess Luna, Princess Cadance  

    Applejack ...As in Discord Discord? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes! 
    Fluttershy I don't think it's that big of a surprise. He can be very helpful. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle He can sense when there's a magical imbalance. The next time Tirek steals magic, Discord will be able to track him down! 
    Rainbow Dash So what are you supposed to do in the meantime? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Nothing. Unless of course one of you needs me to smile and wave. 
    Spike Where are you going? 
    Twilight Sparkle To the Castle of the Two Sisters. I'm not really needed anywhere else. Might as well catch up on some of my reading. 
    Rainbow Dash You want some company? 
    Applejack It has been a while since we visited the castle. Might be fun! 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe I could use a little company right now. 

    Rainbow Dash  I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements. 
    Rarity It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived. 
    Fluttershy But Twilight was right. Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever. 
    Applejack I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up. 
    Discord  Oh, you're talking about me, I presume? 
    Applejack How'd you guess? 
    Discord My ears were burning. 
     
    Rainbow Dash What are you even doing here, Discord? 
    Discord Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee. 
    Spike Big deal. 
    Discord You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess. 
     
    Discord Mmwah! Mmwah! 
    Rainbow Dash In your dreams! 
     
    Discord Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna. 
    Applejack Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down? 
    Discord Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait a minute! How do you know how she was feeling?! 
    Discord  Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend? 
     
    Discord  Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit. 
     
    Applejack And good riddance! 
    Discord Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look!  We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy I wouldn't miss it. 
    Discord  Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...! 
     
    Applejack Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord. 
    Rarity Indeed. 
    Fluttershy But he could be right, couldn't he? What if there is something important in that chest? 
    Twilight Sparkle There's only one way to find out. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Anything? 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle There must be something in this library that can help me figure out how to open it. The answer's in one of these books. I just know it. 
     

     
    Discord Tirek, I presume? 
    Lord Tirek Discord. You're free? 
    Discord As a bird. 
    Lord Tirek I commend you on your escape. 
    Discord I'm afraid the feeling isn't mutual.  
     
    Lord Tirek Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself. 
    Discord Oh, I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for my friends.  
    Lord Tirek Fluttershy? You're not saying you're friends with ponies? 
    Discord Surprise! 
    Lord Tirek I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment. Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces. 
     
    Discord I have done nothing of the sort! 
    Lord Tirek Oh, please, I've seen this before. But he was always weak minded. You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother! Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship. Freedom. Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down. Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself? Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world. 

    Twilight Sparkle I think I found something! I've been reading our journal, and there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony that the tonic Granny bought from the Flim Flam brothers didn't really work? 
    Applejack How could I forget? It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. 

    Granny Smith  
    Applejack  I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake! 
     

    Applejack  And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest. I just knew it. But what's that got to do with openin' the chest? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've found that each of you has had to face a situation where living up to the Element of Harmony you represent wasn't easy. Fluttershy, it was when you realized that the way to show kindness to the Breezies was by forcing them to leave your home. 
    Fluttershy Oh, the looks on their poor little faces! But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, even after Suri took advantage of your generosity at Fashion Week in Manehattan, you didn't let it cause you to abandon your generous spirit. 
    Rarity I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash, you had the chance to fly with the Wonderbolts at the Equestria Games, but instead you chose to compete with your friends. 
    Rainbow Dash Sure! But being loyal to my friends was wayâ€“ 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, my turn, my turn! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you realized that seeing your friend laugh was more important than proving you were a better party planner than Cheese Sandwich. 
    Rainbow Dash Best party I've ever had. 
    Rarity It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack. What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest? 
    Twilight Sparkle All of you had tough choices to make. But when you made the right one and embraced your element, it helped somepony else make the right choice too. Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something special about those objects that could lead us to the location of the keys. The chest is connected to the Tree of Harmony, the Tree is connected to the Elements, and the Elements are connected to all of us. There must be a connection! I hate to admit it, but maybe Discord was trying to be a good friend after all. 

    Twilight Sparkle I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue as to where the keys might be. They're just... ordinary, everyday objects. 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, Boneless! Give us that key! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think that's going to work. 
     
    Main cast  
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle There's still one key missing. The key that represents the element of magic. My element. 
    Fluttershy Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight. 
    Rarity Think, Twilight. When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same? 
    Twilight Sparkle I haven't. If I had, I would have written about it in the journal. 
    Spike Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure you'll get your key eventually.  
     
    Spike What's it say? 
    Twilight Sparkle That I'm needed in Canterlot at once! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle I came as quickly as I could! Is something wrong? Is it Tirek? 
    Princess Celestia I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him. 
     
    Princess Luna Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek. 
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle How could he do this?! I thought our friendship meant something to him! I thought he had changed. 
    Princess Celestia Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land. 
    Princess Luna Ponies will no longer be in control of their world. That power will belong solely to Tirek. 
    Princess Celestia There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it. 
    Princess Luna Once it is in his possession, his power will know no bounds, and all hope will be lost. 
    Princess Celestia But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     

     

Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2

     

    Fluttershy What's wrong, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much. 

    Lord Tirek I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago. 

    Princess Luna With each passing moment, he grows stronger still. 
    Princess Cadance And I know just the princess who can stop him. 
    Princess Celestia I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. 

    Discord  Oh, you're talking about me, I presume? 

    Discord Haven't you girls just learned so much? 

    Twilight Sparkle And there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. 

    Twilight Sparkle Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. 

    Twilight Sparkle There's still one key missing. My element. 

    Lord Tirek Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. 

    Princess Luna Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek. 

    Princess Celestia There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. 

    Princess Celestia We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Princess Luna Tirek is set on possessing Alicorn magic. When he comes for us, we cannot have what he is looking for. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm more than willing to do my part and give up my magic. 
    Princess Luna You misunderstand. Our magic cannot just disappear into thin air. Somepony must keep it safe. 
    Princess Cadance That somepony is you, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why me? 
    Princess Celestia We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone. 
    Princess Cadance Do you understand what we're asking of you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. It's just... I'm only now learning how to control my own Alicorn magic. To take on even moreâ€“ 
    Princess Cadance Twilight, you represent the element of magic. If there is anypony who can do this, it's you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Taking on this task will be one of the most difficult things I'll ever do, but with the help of my friendsâ€“ 
    Princess Celestia I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is the role I am meant to play as a princess of Equestria! I will not fail to do my duty! 
    Princess Celestia Then we must begin at once. 
     

     
    Discord  That can't be right. 
    Lord Tirek What can't be right? 
    Discord Nothing. Carry on. 

     
    Princess Celestia  It is done. 

     
    Spike  You weren't gone very long. Does that mean everything's okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yep! Everything's fine!  
    Spike In that case, I'm going back to bed. Sun's not up... and neither am I. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You can do this. 
     

    Discord Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here? 
    Shining Armor Back off, traitor. 
    Lord Tirek The only one Discord betrayed was himself. Abandoning his true nature to make friends with weak-minded equines who offer him nothing! 
     
    Lord Tirek  
    Shining Armor  How... could you... do this...? 
    Lord Tirek Why don't you go and have a little fun? I won't stand in your way. 
    Discord  

     
     
    Lord Tirek  Where is your magic?! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle I have to gain better control. I sure can't practice here. 
    Spike Uh, Twilight,  where are we goin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, uh, hi, Spike. Uh, gotta go... somewhere... else. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Waaaaah! Whoa! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yiiiipe! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness, are you all right? 
    Applejack Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight! When did you learn to fly that fast? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I must have caught a particularly strong breeze... or something. 
    Rainbow Dash Must have been "or something", because there wasn't any breeze up there. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what happened, but I don't really have time to figure it out right now. 
     
    Rarity Another visit to the Castle of the Two Sisters, I presume? We'd be more than happy to accompany you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Not today! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Tirek may still be a threat. I need you all to stay here and encourage everypony to remain inside. 

    Lord Tirek Getting rid of your magic so that I cannot take it from you? That was your plan? How does it feel, knowing that soon, every Pegasus, unicorn and Earth pony will bow to my will, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it? 
    Princess Celestia You will not prevail, Tirek. 
    Lord Tirek Give my regards to Cerberus. 
    Discord You meant our will, didn't you? 
    Lord Tirek Of course. Here, I want you to have something. This was given to me by someone very close to me. I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty. 
    Discord Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence. 
    Lord Tirek  Amusing. But we have no time for such things. With the princesses out of the way, we can nowâ€“ is this meant to be humorous?! 
    Discord Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet. 
    Lord Tirek There's a fourth? And you did not tell me this?! 
    Discord I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it. 
    Lord Tirek Then where can we find this fourth princess? Where is her castle? 
    Discord Castle?  
    Lord Tirek Not for much longer. 

    Applejack Alright, y'all. I think we've warned everypony to stay inside. 
    Fluttershy I'm sure Discord will catch Tirek and this will all be over soon. 
    Rainbow Dash I'll bet he takes his sweet time. 
    Discord Or perhaps these things just take time. 
    Fluttershy  You're back! Did you bring the cucumber sandwiches? 
    Discord I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time. 
     
    Main cast bar Twilight  
    Discord Ta-da! 
    Lord Tirek You've gathered up all of them? 
    Discord And her little dragon, too. 
    Spike  
    Fluttershy  Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends! 
    Discord Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming. 
    Fluttershy  I didn't. I really didn't. 
    Lord Tirek  
     
    Lord Tirek You really think she'd do anything for them? 
    Discord If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us. 
    Lord Tirek Us? Who said anything about us? 
    Discord You did. 
    Lord Tirek You've helped me grow strong, you've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me. 
     
    Discord  But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you. 
    Lord Tirek My brother who betrayed me. It is as worthless as he is. 
    Applejack Surely you saw this comin'. 
    Discord  I didn't. I truly didn't. 

    Twilight Sparkle I can do this. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle See! Ha! Perfectly controlled teleportationâ€“ 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Lord Tirek Princess Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Tirek! 
    Lord Tirek You have something that belongs to me! 
     
    Lord Tirek You're going to give me what I want!  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Lord Tirek Now I understand what your fellow princesses have done! 
     
    Lord Tirek  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Lord Tirek  
     
     
     
    Lord Tirek It appears we are at an impasse. How about a trade, Princess Twilight? Their release for all the Alicorn magic in Equestria. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rest of main cast  
    Lord Tirek What's it going to be, Princess? 

    Rainbow Dash  Don't do it, Twilight! 
    Fluttershy  We aren't worth it! 
    Discord  Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either. 
    Lord Tirek Enough! I want an answer, and I want it now! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I will give you my magic, in exchange for my friends. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Lord Tirek As you wish. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle All of my friends. 
    Lord Tirek After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a 'friend'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Release him! 
    Lord Tirek If that's what you want. 
     
    Discord Thank you, Twilight.  I'm sorry. 
    Fluttershy I know. 
    Lord Tirek Your turn. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Lord Tirek  Yes! 
    Spike Twilight, what were you thinking?! 
    Discord Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth. 
    Applejack You think that might be the last one we need? 
    Twilight Sparkle We have to get to the chest. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Together! I think we have to do this together! 
     
    Main cast  
     
    Lord Tirek How is this possible?! You have no magic! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're wrong, Tirek! I may have given you my Alicorn magic, but I carry within me the most powerful magic of all! 
    Lord Tirek  
     
     
    Rarity Sweet Celestia! Are you all seeing what I'm seeing? 
    Twilight Sparkle But... whose is it? 
    Princess Celestia I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight. 

    Princess Celestia You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now? 
    Twilight Sparkle As princess, I believe I have the power to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. That is the role I am meant to have in our world! The role I choose to have! But I didn't defeat Tirek on my own â€“ it took all of us to unlock the chest! 
    Princess Celestia Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone. 
    Main cast  
    Pinkie Pie Wowee! 
    Princess Celestia You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends? 
    Discord Wait a minute, where's my throne?! 
    Fluttershy I don't think you're quite there yet. 
    Discord  Yes, well, I suppose not. 

    

        Each one of us has something special 
        That makes us different, that makes us rare 

    

        We have a light that shines within us 
        That we were always meant to share 

    

        And when we come together 
        Combine the light that shines within 
        There is nothing we can't do 
        There is no battle we can't win 

        When we come together 
        There'll be a star to guide the way 
        It's inside us every day 

        See it now! See it now! 

        Let the rainbow remind you 
        That together we will always shine 
        Let the rainbow remind you 
        That forever this will be our time 

     

    

        Let the rainbow remind you 
        That together we will always shine 

     

The Cutie Map - Part 1

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Let's go through this one more time. 
    Rainbow Dash  We've been over it like a million times, Twilight! We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle! End of story! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but why? 
    Applejack I dunno, sugarcube. Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that. 
    Rarity I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine! 
    Fluttershy I agree with Twilight. And Rarity. And Applejack. And Rainbow Dash. And Pinkie Pie. Oh, and probably Spike. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense. 
     
    Spike  Is that new? I like it. 

     

    Spike This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria! 
    Pinkie Pie Hi, Mom and Dad! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we not follow it? 
    Rainbow Dash Y'know what? There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route. Count me in! 
    Applejack Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay! 
    Rarity  Very well. 
     
    Fluttershy Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike. 
    Spike Awesome! Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and... and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats... 
    Fluttershy O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them. In case they need me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like it's time for a road trip. 
    Spike Well, suit yourself. But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws. 

     
     

    Twilight Sparkle That's it! That's the place on the map! 
    Rarity Right. Let's get down there and find the spa. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! 
    Pinkie Pie Stay behind me, everypony! I'm on it! 
    Applejack Careful, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Rainbow Dash This is where the map sent us? It looks like the most boring place in Equestria. 
    Applejack It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk. 
    Rarity It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or any architectural flourishes. 
    Fluttershy I think it's lovely. 
    Pinkie Pie I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I know smiles. And those smiles? They're just not right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, that's weird. 

    Twilight Sparkle An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be? 
    Rainbow Dash I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it. 
    Twilight Sparkle What makes you say that? 
    Rainbow Dash 'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome! 
    Applejack I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on. 
    Rainbow Dash Great idea, AJ. Let's go! 
    Pinkie Pie Those smiles are bad news. 

    Male Creepy Pony 1 Welcome! 
    Female Creepy Pony 1 Welcome! 
    Male Creepy Pony 2 Welcome! 
    "Bacon Braids" Welcome! 
    Male Creepy Pony 3 Welcome! 
    Female Creepy Pony 3 Welcome! 
    Creepy Foals Welcome! 
    Fluttershy This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria! 
    Night Glider Welcome! 
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. Thanks a lot, map. 
    Party Favor Welcome! Pardon my forwardness, but are you an Alicorn? 
    Applejack That there's the Princess of Friendship! 
    Party Favor Well, you've certainly come to the right place for friendship. 
    Double Diamond What brings you to town? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're not entirely sure. 
    Double Diamond I see. Well, all are welcome here in our little village. My name is Double Diamond, and this is Party Favor. 
    Applejack Howdy, Double Diamond. I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle. 
    Double Diamond And you all have your own unique cutie marks. 
    Twilight Sparkle If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately? 
    Double Diamond Trouble? Why, I don't think we've ever had trouble in our little village. 
    Party Favor It's true. You'll see. Hm. 
    Double Diamond Perhaps you'd care to speak to our founder Starlight Glimmer. 
    Fluttershy I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are. 
    Pinkie Pie I've got my eye on them. Something's rotten in... whatever the name of this village is that we're in right now! 
     
    Double Diamond Starlight, we have some new visitors. 
    Rainbow Dash  Be ready to fight. We don't know what's gonna come through that door. 
    Starlight Glimmer Welcome! I'm so pleased to have you here. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Double Diamond This is Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle. 
    Starlight Glimmer Forgive my bluntness, but I'm assuming it's Princess Twilight Sparkle? We don't get many Alicorns around here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but "Twilight" is fine. 
    Starlight Glimmer So! How did you hear of our little village? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map. 
    Pinkie Pie Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map! 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience true friendship for the first time. 
    Applejack Say what? 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt. 
    Twilight Sparkle Is that why you all have those cutie marks? 
    Starlight Glimmer Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Heads high, ponies! Marching proud!  All together now! Every one of you! No pony left behind! 

        Life is so grand in Our Town 
        We're always filled with cheer 
        We never have to look around 
        To know that we're all here 

    

        In Our Town, in Our Town 
        We don't have to wait 
        To find out that our destiny 
        Is just to emulate 

    Starlight Glimmer Let's see those big, happy smiles! 

        Life is a smile in Our Town 
        Our cutie mark's the same 
        Because we do not separate 
        Ourselves by more than name 

    

        In Our Town, in Our Town 
        We dare not compete 
        Winning only breeds the worst 
        Ego-filled conceit 

    Starlight Glimmer You see? Now everypony wins! 

        Life is a joy in Our Town 
        We're all equal here 
        No one is superior 
        And no one shakes in fear 

    

        In Our Town, in Our Town 
        We work as a team 
        You can't have a nightmare 
        If you never dream 

    

        Other ponies argue 
        Do you ever wonder why? 
        When you think your talent's special 
        You don't see eye-to-eye 

        There's just too many differences 
        That lead to disarray 
        But when you learn to act as one 
        It's like a holiday 

    

        In Our Town, in Our Town 
        We don't complicate 
        When you learn to simplify 
        Life is oh, so great 

        Join in our utopia 
        Come out of the dark 
        Banded by equality 
        By our cutie mark! 

    Rainbow Dash  You're kidding, right? Give up our cutie marks? No way! 
    Fluttershy Rainbow Dash, don't be so rude. I don't think we should judge them. They all seem perfectly happy with their choice. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this. 
    Starlight Glimmer We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks. 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is she for real? 
    Twilight Sparkle When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help. 
    Starlight Glimmer Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so we could help you? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely your choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need. 
    Double Diamond Of course. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community. When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish. 

    Male Creepy Pony 3 Welcome! 
    Female Creepy Pony 4 Welcome! 
    Male Creepy Pony 1 Welcome! 
    Twilight Sparkle A cutie mark is a representation of a pony's unique talents and skills. How is it possible toâ€” 
    Rarity  What in the name of Equestria is that?! 
    Shopkeeper Welcome! Care to sample some local fashion? We've got cloaks this month! 
    Rarity  No wonder nopony's wearing anything! 
    Fluttershy  Really, girls! They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude. 
    Rainbow Dash  No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us! 
    Double Diamond Need something? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, no! We're good!  Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies. 
    Applejack I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was! 
    Pinkie Pie If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'!  Get it? 
    Rarity Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong. 
    Applejack That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider. 
    Sugar Belle Is this a bad time? 
    Fluttershy We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends. Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Don't drag me into this! 
    Sugar Belle Is your friendship ending? 
    Pinkie Pie Are you crazy?! We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food! 
    Sugar Belle O-kay, well, my name is Sugar Belle. What can I bring you? We have muffins... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Then I guess we'll take six muffins! 
    Pinkie Pie Make that twelve! What? I'm hungry! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now. 
    Applejack I guess you're right. And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home. 
    Sugar Belle Forgive me for overhearing, but just a moment ago you were disagreeing, and now it sounds like you're... agreeing. 
    Applejack Uh-huh... 
    Sugar Belle Well, you had such differing opinions â€“ and cutie marks. 
    Rarity We have differing opinions all the time, darling. 
    Sugar Belle But you look like you're friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle We are friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that. 
    Sugar Belle I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time understanding. Different talents lead to different opinions, which lead to bitterness and misery. So... why aren't you bitter and...? 
    Pinkie Pie  Blech! Mmmm... good... 
    Sugar Belle It's all right. I know I'm not a very good baker. At least, I know I'm not any better than anypony else in the village. Well, I... hope you enjoy our little village! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Sugar Belle  Come inside before you go! Meet me downstairs! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, that was weird too. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched. 
     
    Rainbow Dash You think? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle. 
    Double Diamond  
    Applejack I got an idea. But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Me?! Why me?! 
    Applejack  You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here. 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack  I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie! We'd best go inside and get some more! 
    Twilight Sparkle Nice work, Pinkie. 
     
    Pinkie Pie I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that... 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello? Sugar Belle? 
    Sugar Belle Thank you for coming! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why did you want us to come down here? 
    Sugar Belle So nopony could see what's about to happen. 
    Party Favor Are you really the Princess of Friendship? 
    Night Glider Do you know Princess Celestia? 
    Sugar Belle I love your cutie mark! 
    Night Glider How can you be friends with different cutie marks? Don't you end up hating each other? 
    Sugar Belle Oh, look at this one! This one's great too! I'd love to have my special talent back even just for a day! Make something besides those disgusting muffins... 
    Rainbow Dash So what's stopping you? Go get your cutie marks back. 
    Party Favor Daydreaming is one thing, but you mean actually having it put back on? That seems extreme. 
    Sugar Belle I'm not sure Starlight would like that. She wants us all to be happy in our sameness. 
    Twilight Sparkle How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway? 
    Night Glider The cutie unmarking is a beautiful experience! Starlight uses the Staff of Sameness to magically take them away and replace them with these. 
    Twilight Sparkle But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are. 
    Night Glider Oh, we're not kept from them. They're in the vault up in the caves. We can visit them any time we like to remind us of the heartache of a life with special talents. 
    Twilight Sparkle Can we visit this cave? 

    Starlight Glimmer I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of  perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land. 
    Twilight Sparkle  This must be the reason we're here. 
    Pinkie Pie  "Pilgrimaging"? 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back. 
    Fluttershy  Oh, are you sure, Twilight? Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right. 
    Starlight Glimmer Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault! 
    Twilight Sparkle I've never seen anything like it! 
    Starlight Glimmer And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious â€“ how did the subject of the vault come up? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, andâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Oops... 
    Starlight Glimmer  Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you? 
    Rarity  Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming littleâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Good. Let's just make sure of that, shall we? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's a trap! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rest of main cast  
    Starlight Glimmer Aw. I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today. You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Give them back! 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here with us! And we'll teach you just how much better life can be without your cutie marks! 
     

     

The Cutie Map - Part 2

     

    Twilight Sparkle As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? 
     
    Spike This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria! 

    Fluttershy Why are our cutie marks over there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Seems like the map wants us to find out. 

    Twilight Sparkle An entire village with the same cutie mark? 

    Starlight Glimmer Welcome! 

    Fluttershy This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria! 

    Starlight Glimmer I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. 

    Twilight Sparkle It's a trap! 

    Twilight Sparkle  

    Starlight Glimmer Now you can spend the rest of your lives here without your cutie marks! 

     

    Starlight Glimmer  In sameness, there is peace. Exceptionalism is a lie. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Free yourself from your cutie mark. Choose equality as your special talent. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Starlight Glimmer  Difference is frustration. To excel is to fail. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, this is pretty good! 
    Starlight Glimmer  Be your best by never being your best. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh, we've gotta find a way out of here! I can't take much more of that voice! 
    Rarity Oh, this is horrible!  
    Fluttershy There, there, Rarity... It's not so bad... 
    Rarity Yes, it is! Look at those drapes! I have no idea if they're tacky or not! 
    Fluttershy Well, I think they're nice. 
     
    Rarity  So do I! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, thank goodness! Can you help us, little birdie? 
     
     
    Fluttershy Go on, now! Fly away and get us help! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, even tweets don't make sense any more! 
    Applejack  This door's shut tighter than a... summer of... 
     
    Applejack ...uh, piglets in... shoot! I can't even make countryisms no more! 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know! Maybe it'll be super fun to be all the same! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Sort of. More pleasant than fun, I guess... 
    Twilight Sparkle Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had eight magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff. 
    Applejack Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it. 
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Twilight Sparkle I've got it! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle I know how we can get out! 
    Rainbow Dash  Forget it, Twilight. This door's not opening. 
    Rarity And I'm afraid the windows are much too small for escape. 
    Twilight Sparkle But there is a third way. 
    Pinkie Pie Of course! Eventually the wind and the weather will wear down the walls until they start to crumble! Then all we have to do is wait for a big enough hole to form and we can just walk out! It's the perfect plan! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I guess. 
    Twilight Sparkle We don't actually have to escape. They'll just let us out when they think we've accepted their philosophy! 
    Applejack But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night. 
    Twilight Sparkle There's one of us they might believe. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! Me?! 
    Rainbow Dash You've been saying how great this place is since we got here! 
    Fluttershy But that's because everypony's so nice and their village is so pretty, and, and... Oh, you're right. They probably would believe me. I hate to lie to them. They've been so welcoming and friendly... aside from locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special... Okay. I'll do it. 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! I mean, cool. 
    Fluttershy But what do I do once I'm out? 
    Twilight Sparkle You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back. 
    Fluttershy  
     
    Starlight Glimmer  Oh, good morning! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer I trust you had a pleasant night? This way, please. There are some friends who'd like to see you. Gather round, friends, gather round! We've come to ask if any of you are ready to join us! There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutie marks or the talents that come with them. 
    Double Diamond We have a welcome ceremony for new friends! The whole village joins together to build you your own cottageâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Not interested! You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back! 
    Applejack Y'all don't understand, do ya? You can't force nopony to be friends! It don't work like that! 
    Pony 1 Please, join us! 
    Pony 2 We love new friends! 
    Starlight Glimmer It's all right, everypony. This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't... quite seen the light yet. We'll try again tomorrow once you've had a bit more time to consider our philosophy! 
    Fluttershy I'd like to join! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy? How could you?! 
    Fluttershy If giving up my cutie mark means I get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then I'll do it. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer We have a new friend, everypony! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Now, there's one more order of business. It seems some in our midst might be... dissatisfied with the village life! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Unfortunately, it's all too true, my friends!  Will you kindly tell us the names of those friends who so desperately miss their cutie marks that they would sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it? Just so we can be sure your intentions are indeed pure. 
    Fluttershy  

    Fluttershy Um, I don't know who they were. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know your names and faces yet. 
    Starlight Glimmer Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly. Kindly point them out! 
    Party Favor It was me! It was only me! But I only wanted it back for a little while! 
    Starlight Glimmer And you're quite certain it was only you? 
    Party Favor I just wanted to remember what it was like. 
    Starlight Glimmer And no thought to the pain you'd cause your friends. Such selfishness. 
    Party Favor I'm sorry, everypony! I never wanted to leave the village! I love all ofâ€” 
     
    Party Favor What was I thinking?! I can't believe I even considered asking for my cutie mark back. 
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry. Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time! 
    Party Favor Didn't you see what just happened out there?! Your friend has accepted our way! You will all accept our way! It's only a matter of time! 
    Rainbow Dash This guy's a barrel of laughs. 
    Pinkie Pie  Laughs don't come in barrels. They come from inside you as your body's response to delight. 
    Applejack  cutie marks? 
    Twilight Sparkle We have to stay as positive as we can. If Party Favor sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different, maybe we can use him to spread our message to the rest of the village. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Rarity Let's hope they don't convert any of us first. 

    Mare 1 Welcome! 
    Mare 2 Welcome! 
    Stallion 1 Welcome! 
    Fluttershy Gosh, you really are the nicest ponies I've ever met. 
    Starlight Glimmer Come. All new friends stay with me until their cottage is completed. Let's get you settled, and then you can enjoy all that our little village has to offer. 

     
    Fluttershy  Get the cutie marks back. That's all you've gotta do, Fluttershy. Just sneak through the dark up to that spooky old cave with the scary magical staff and get the cutie marks back. 

    Fluttershy Okay, you're doing great. The cave's gotta be close now... 
    Starlight Glimmer Excellent work, Double Diamond. 
    Double Diamond Of course, but I don't understand why you wanted me to bring them here. Fluttershy is one of us now. Surely she can be trusted. 
    Starlight Glimmer This one belongs to a princess. It could be very important to our cause. 
    Double Diamond But if Twilight Sparkle becomes our friend, then why do we care about this old cutie mark? 
    Starlight Glimmer I just want to keep them close until everything is... settled. You may go, Double Diamond. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, dear. How am I ever going to get the cutie marks back now? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Ow! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! Starlight, you clumsy foal! 
    Fluttershy  Oh, no... 

    Starlight Glimmer I've got a good feeling about today! So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say? Aw, pity. Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid! 
    Fluttershy Wait! I'd like to lock them in. 
    Starlight Glimmer Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please? 
    Party Favor I'm sorry, Starlight! I'm sorry, everypony! I've seen the error of my ways! I never want to look at my cutie mark again! 
    Starlight Glimmer It seems there's cause for celebration after all! 
    Crowd Hooray!  
    Party Favor They tried to break me! They wouldn't stop talking about how different they are, and that somehow makes their friendship stronger! 
    Starlight Glimmer Such backwards thinking. 
    Party Favor But I didn't listen! I knew what they were up to, and I didn't listen! 
    Starlight Glimmer Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves! 
    Fluttershy Um, Starlight? I think we might have one more friend joining us today. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Is this true? 
    Twilight Sparkle I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier? 
    Starlight Glimmer Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known! 
    Twilight Sparkle And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark? 
    Starlight Glimmer Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here! 
     
    Fluttershy Then how do you explain this?! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer I knew you couldn't be trusted! No! Get away! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me! 
    Party Favor How could you? 
    Double Diamond You said cutie marks were evil! You said special talents led to pain and heartache! 
    Starlight Glimmer They do! Don't you see?! Look at them! 
    Sugar Belle Then why? Why did you take ours and not give up your own? 
    Starlight Glimmer I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?! 
    Night Glider But the staff has all the magic we need! 
    Starlight Glimmer The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's my magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for my magical abilities! I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I created harmony! 
    Double Diamond You lied to us! 
    Starlight Glimmer So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal! 
    Party Favor Except for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how reaâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer QUIET! 
    Sugar Belle You can't have a cutie mark, Starlight! Either we're all equal, or none of us are! 
     
    Double Diamond Come on! Let's get our cutie marks back! 
    Crowd Yeah!  
    Rainbow Dash Come on! Let's go get our cutie marks! 
    Fluttershy Our cutie marks aren't in the vault! They're in there with her! 

     
    Double Diamond Stand back, everypony! 
     
     
    Rarity Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful! 
    Starlight Glimmer They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks! 
    Applejack  
    Rarity  
     
    Night Glider Stand back, everypony! 
     
     
     
    Fluttershy They're gone! They were right over there! 

    Rainbow Dash Look! 
    Party Favor  
     
    Party Favor She's headed for the pass! If she makes it into those mountains, we'll never find her! 
    Pinkie Pie These are amazing! 
    Sugar Belle There's a whole network of caves up there! Your cutie marks will be gone forever! 
    Applejack Then let's get moving, y'all! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, come on! 

     
    Starlight Glimmer Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these strangers?! 
     
    Sugar Belle We gave up everything for you, because we thought you were our friend! 

    Rainbow Dash I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks! 
    Twilight Sparkle If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us! 
    Fluttershy And I know they can do it! 

    Sugar Belle My newest recipe â€“ snow pie! 
     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash She's gonna get away! 
    Double Diamond Whoa! These are my old skis! This is where I first met Starlight! 
    Night Glider Maybe you can reminisce another time! She's almost to the caves! 
    Double Diamond Feel like an air drop? 
     
     
     
     
    Applejack Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again! 
    Fluttershy And you got your countryisms back, too! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Whâ€“ I studied that spell for years! How can youâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now! 
    Starlight Glimmer Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise! 
    Double Diamond How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance! 
     
    Rainbow Dash She's getting away! 
    Double Diamond We'll never find her in there! 
    Twilight Sparkle We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all have taught her something. 
    Party Favor It's you who have taught us something. We all came to this village because we were searching for something missing from our lives. We thought Starlight had given it to us, but now... now it seems it was in front of us all along. It's us! 
    Twilight Sparkle Does that mean you'll stay in the village? 
    Night Glider It's our home. I'm not going anywhere. 
    Double Diamond This is a chance for all of us to get to know each other again for the very first time! 
    Sugar Belle And I finally have a chance to bake something besides terrible muffins! 
    All  

     
     
    Pinkie Pie Now those are real smiles. 
     
    Applejack I'll never get used to that. 
    Rarity I think it's divine. 
    Fluttershy Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else? 
    Twilight Sparkle I have a feeling it means our work here is done. 
    Applejack Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map did have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship. 
    Twilight Sparkle But the map didn't send me. It sent us. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too. 
    Main cast  
    Pinkie Pie This feels like an ending! It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right? 'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake! 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe we can stay a little while longer. Come on! 

     

Castle Sweet Castle

     
     
     
    Fluttershy Phew! Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle No problem, happy to do it! 
    Fluttershy You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Aren't there more animals that need cleaning? 
    Fluttershy I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, no! Angel got dirty! I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too! 
     

     

    Fluttershy Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um... I think he's dry. 
     
    Fluttershy Goodness! It's gotten late! You really didn't have to stay all day. Not that we don't appreciate it. Isn't that right? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy I for one am exhausted.  And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle No! The castle's... fine! But maybe I'd better see if Pinkie Pie needs help with the pancakes! 
     
    Fluttershy  Um, Angel? 

     
    Applejack  Mm, these are delicious, Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie  Thanks! Twilight spent all night helping me pick the flavor! I kept thinking we'd found the right one, but she insisted I make even more to try. And more. And more and more and more and more! It was like she never wanted toâ€” 
    Fluttershy Leave? 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly!  The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter. Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake! 
    Rainbow Dash Up all night, huh? Is that why she's so, uh... out of it? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately? 
    Applejack Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight. Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten. 
    Rarity She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique. An entire afternoon! 
    Rainbow Dash You think that's weird? She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day. And lost every time! She just kept goin'! Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred! I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing thanâ€” 
    Fluttershy Leave? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. Who does that? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Applejack Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what. 
    Pinkie Pie  I win! 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh?! I'm pancake! I mean, awake... 
    Applejack Uh, Twilight? Is there somethin' you wanna tell us? 
    Rarity You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around... but... we worry you might be... ahem... avoiding something else? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, has it been that obvious? I've been... the thing is... I know it's silly, but I... I've been avoiding... this place. 
    Rarity  Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle? 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, this place has everything! Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny! Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch! Brrr! And it even has loooong empty hallways! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, I get it. 
    Twilight Sparkle The castle is amazing. But it just...  It doesn't feel like home. 
    Rarity  Oh, is that all? Why, you simply need to decorate, darling. Make this space your own! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's just so daunting! Look how big it is! I-I don't even know where to start! 
    Rarity You can start by letting us do it for you. We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation. I'm saying this with love, but... have you looked in a mirror lately? I've never seen you look this... mmmm... 
    Fluttershy Frazzled? 
    Rarity Yes! That is absolutely the word I was going to use. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh, I guess I do need a little help. And so does my castle. And I just know you'll do a great job, because nopony knows me better than you. 
    Applejack We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day. 
    Rainbow Dash  Uh, I mean, let's decorate! 
    Spike Oh, no! Did I miss the pancakes?! 
     
    Spike I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling. 
    Rarity Spike, I'm so glad you're here! 
    Spike Really? 
    Rarity Yes! You're taking Twilight to the spa! 
    Spike Great! I've been meaning to get my claws done!  
    Applejack Come on, y'all! We've got work to do! 
    

        Let's all work together 
        To make this castle shi-i-ine 

    

        Once we add some sparkle 
        It'll feel, it'll feel, it'll feel... 

    

        It'll feel divine 

    

        Crates of apples an' bales o' hay 
        Just makes ya feel at home 

    

        Furry friends and some popinjays 
        So she won't be alone 

    

        And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make 
        This castle a home 

    

        There's nothing like balloons and confetti 
        To greet you every time you walk through the door 

    

        She'll need this and those 
        Posters of all my heroes 
        How could anypony awesome ever ask for more? 

    

        And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make 
        A home she'll adore 

    

        Bright curtains of flowing silk and lace 

    

        This picture of me winning a race 

    

        Party cannons to give her a surprise 

    

        Hoes and rakes and some more garden supplies 

    

        Getting hugs from this nice, big, friendly bear 

    

        Decorate with some gemstones bright and rare 

    

        More of this and that 

    

        Don't forget the party hats 

    

        How could anypony awesome ask for more than that? 

    

        Let's all work together 

    

        To show that we have shown 

    

        Princess Twilight Sparkle 

    

        How we make, how we make, how we make 
        This castle a home 
        How we make, how we make 
        This castle a home 
        How we make, how we make 
        This castle a home! 

     
     

    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash We sure did... something. 
    Pinkie Pie  Together. 
    Rarity  All together. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Fluttershy, I love that you brought so many animals. 
    Fluttershy Are these your trophies? 
    Rainbow Dash I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies but with my name permanently etched onto them. 
    Rarity  Are these quilts vintage? 
    Applejack Nope, just old! Unlike your sparkly window doohickeys which are... why, they're just swell!  
    Pinkie Pie No one said anything about my hidden confetti cannons!  
     
    Spike Hey guys, how do my claws lookâ€”Sweet Celestia! 
    Rarity Oh, Spike! Are you and Twilight done already? 
    Spike Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out! She'll be a while. Man, this place looks terrible! 
    Main cast sans Twilight Phew! 
    Fluttershy Thank goodness somepony said something! 
    Rainbow Dash It's pretty bad, right? 
    Applejack This place looks like a mishmash of knickknacks. 
    Rarity Hmm, I suppose it is a little cluttered. 
    Pinkie Pie What are you guys talking about? I think it looks super fun! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
    Fluttershy Oh! Oh, no! Please don't do that! If you all just take a deep breath and calm downâ€” 
     
    Rarity No! That bunting is embroidered by hoof! Don't you move one more paw! 
     
    Rarity Everypony, stop! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, now it's a mess. 
     
    Rainbow Dash What're we gonna do?! 
    Spike I dunno. But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long. If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, guys, we've gotta do something! Twilight's counting on us! 
    Rarity Spike, you've got to get back to that spa and stall her! Whatever you do, don't let her come home! 
    Spike Like, forever? But we live here. 
    Rarity Uh, yes, well, uh, maybe you could manage it 'til... sunset-ish?  
    Spike Anything for you, Rarity... 
    Applejack Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right? So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks? 
    Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  

    Twilight Sparkle Spike, you're back! How do I look? 
    Spike Great! 
    Twilight Sparkle And more importantly, how does the castle look? 
    Spike Great? 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't wait to go home and see it! 
    Spike Great! I mean, no! I mean, uh, I'm not... quite ready to go yet. Uh, why don't we have a massage? I was really hoping to get, uh... this thingy! 
    Twilight Sparkle  The 'Extra-strength-hot-stone-deep-tissue massage'? 
    Spike  Yep! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think I'll just have a traditional massage, but you go for it. 
    Aloe Did somepony order massages? 
     
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! Let's do this, little dragon! 
     
    Aloe Oh, I hate it when he does that. Come with me, princess. 

    Applejack Come on, Rarity. Everypony has taken somethin' out except you. 
    Rarity Ooh, I know! I simply can't decide. 
    Rainbow Dash How about this? 
    Rarity No! Not that! Anything but that! 
    Rainbow Dash How about these? 
    Rarity Oh, but those brighten up the whole room! They're my favorite accent! 
    Rainbow Dash Then let's lose the curtains! The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark! 
    Rarity Not them! They're my favorite too! 
    Rainbow Dash  They can't all be your favorite! Okay, I'm taking down the portrait. We all know what we look like. 
    Rarity  Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it? Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two. Only to be helpful, of course! 
    Applejack Okay, everypony calm down. I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter together. 
    Rarity You're absolutely right, dear. 
    Applejack Hey, those are my warmin' quilts! 
    Rainbow Dash and Rarity Together! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy, tell your birds to stop pecking at my balloons! 
    Fluttershy I guess they must not like being scared out of their wits by exploding confetti cannons or something. 
    Pinkie Pie But we can't get rid of the cannons! I don't remember where I hid them. 
     
    Rarity Allow me to help. 
    Applejack Oh, no, I'll help you. 
    Rainbow Dash Not if I help you first! 

    Twilight Sparkle  Great suggestion, Spike. I feel totally relaxed. 
    Spike  Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow... 
    Twilight Sparkle You want to hop on? Maybe I can get us to the castle faster. 
    Spike  Ow! I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know. 
    Spike Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? I've never heard that theory. 

    Twilight Sparkle  I really miss this place, Spike. We had so many wonderful memories here. 
    Spike We did, didn't we...? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Spike, I'm so sorry. Of course losing the Golden Oak Library was hard for you too.  I've got an idea. Why don't we have the girls add some things to make the castle feel more like your home as well? 
    Spike Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle Hop on! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ow! What are you doing? 
    Spike I, um... I just thought of what I want! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, okay. What is it? 
    Spike It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed! 
    Twilight Sparkle I thought you said you sleep like a baby in the castle. 
    Spike  Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go! 

    Rarity There! Now nothing is cluttering the castle! 
    Rainbow Dash You're right. There is literally nothing cluttering this castle. 
    Fluttershy What do we do now? 
    Rarity I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset. If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her! 
    Rainbow Dash Why is this so hard?! We're Twilight's best friends! This should be easy for us! 
    Applejack She said it herself â€“ if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us. If we can't do it... 
    Fluttershy Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel... sad! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wow, Fluttershy! I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo! 

    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie What do we do? What do we do?! If Twilight comes home now, she'll be like "What did you guys do?" And we'll have to be like "Nothing!" And then she'll be like "I was counting on you! Some friends you are!" And we'll be like...  
    Applejack Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right. 
    Rarity Well, I didn't do anything wrong! I did exactly what I would do if this were my home! 
    Rainbow Dash But it's not your home. It's Twilight's home! 
    Rarity Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies? 
    Rainbow Dash TouchÃ©. 
    Fluttershy Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight. 
    Applejack Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library? 
    Fluttershy Oh, everything! The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books... 
    Rainbow Dash Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up?  That was good times. 
    Applejack Yeah, for you, maybe. 
    Rarity Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there? That turned out to be so much fun! 
    Pinkie Pie Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?! Wait, no, that was the worst. 
    Applejack We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home. 
    Rest of main cast sans Twilight Yeah... 
    Applejack  That's it! 

    Twilight Sparkle How's that one? Too soft? Too hard? Too lumpy? 
    Spike Um... Just right! I'll take it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, thank goodness. I thought you'd never find one you liked! Let's find a salespony and get out of here. 
    Spike Sounds good to meeeâ€”I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that?  Too squeaky! Better keep looking! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Applejack  Maybe my plan won't work after all. 
    Rarity Of course it will, darling. I can see it! You and Fluttershy stay here. Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me. We're going shopping! We'll meet back at the castle. 
    

        It's not the things that ya gather 'round 

    

        It's not how much you own 

    

        The things that hold the meaning in your life 
        Are the memories you've sown 

    

        So we make, so we make, so we make 
        This castle a home 
        So we make, so we make 
        This castle a home 
        So we make, so we make 
        This castle a home! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Hello? We're home! 
    Rest of main cast Welcome home! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I, uh... love what you've done with the place. You did such a good job of... preserving the integrity of the original design. 
    Spike Aw, come on! It looks exactly the same! Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?! I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait. Keep me from coming back here? 
    Rarity  It took a teensy bit longer than we thought. 
    Applejack What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there. 
    Rarity So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville. 
     
    Fluttershy The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together. 
    Pinkie Pie That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville! 
    Fluttershy The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala! 
    Rarity We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones. 
    Applejack And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's exactly what the castle needed. And I am ready to make new memories here. 
    Pinkie Pie Then let's start right now with a new memory cake! Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise! These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans! 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's go to the dining room. It's a little sparse, but  at least there's a table and chairs. Whoa! What happened in here? Last I checked, this place was empty! 
    Rarity I couldn't help myself! It was just begging for the personal touch! 
    Applejack Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight. 
    Rainbow Dash And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library. 
    Fluttershy And some stuffed animals in your bedroom. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What was that?! 
    Applejack  One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons. 
    Pinkie Pie What? It's not my fault I hid them so well! 
    Main cast  
    Applejack  Oh, Pinkie... 

     

Bloom & Gloom

     
    Apple Bloom Hear ye, hear ye! This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! Who wants to do roll-call? 
     
    Scootaloo I'm pretty sure we're all here. 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about? 
    Apple Bloom Oh, nothin'... except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle What?! 
    Apple Bloom She says it's a pair of scissors! 
    Scootaloo So... she's good at cutting stuff? 
    Sweetie Belle Of course! She was always fussing with her bangs and tail! I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist! 
    Apple Bloom But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs? 
    Scootaloo Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, wow. I guess you're right. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like? 
    Apple Bloom No... or at least I hadn't... 
    Sweetie Belle Don't worry, Apple Bloom. Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks. I bet yours will be, too. And what's not to like about apples? 
    Scootaloo There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in themâ€” What? 
    Sweetie Belle Not helping. 

     

    Apple Bloom I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered. 
    Applejack I'm sure there are, but you don't need toâ€” 
    Apple Bloom What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me? 
    Applejack Well, that's just ridicuâ€” 
    Apple Bloom What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore!  What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! Where will I live?! 
    Applejack All right, that's enough, sugarcube. Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night. 
    Apple Bloom Butâ€” 
    Applejack And nopony's gonna make ya move out. 
    Apple Bloom Are you sure, Applejack? 
    Applejack Of course, I'm sure. Now get some sleep. You'll see. Everything will be better in the mornin'.

        Hush now, little sister 
        You're loved by all you know 
        You'll never lose their friendship 
        No matter where you go 

        There ain't no call to worry 
        So don't you cry or fret 
        A cutie mark won't change you 
        No matter what you get 

     
    Apple Bloom  No matter what I get. 

    Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom Hoo-ee! Nothin' like a good night's sleep! 
    Applejack  Breakfast! 

    Apple Bloom You were right, Applejack! I feel much better! I don't know what I was so worried about last night! 
    Applejack See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about anâ€” Well, no wonder you were so worked up! 
    Apple Bloom What? What is it? 
    Applejack Looks like somepony got her cutie mark! 
    Apple Bloom  I got my cutie mark! Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it? 
    Applejack I have no idea what it means. 
    Pest Control Pony  

    Apple Bloom Infestations? You mean like... parasprites? 
    Pest Control Pony Hah, please. Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites. I'm talking about the serious stuff! You ever hear of... twittermites? 
     
    Apple Bloom Twittermites? 
    Pest Control Pony Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria! 
    Apple Bloom Pest ponies? 
    Pest Control Pony It's no easy trade! Even the best of us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures. Oh, now that you're here to take over, my day has finally come! 
    Apple Bloom Take over? 
    Pest Control Pony You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything. 
    Apple Bloom I'm sorry. I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'. 
    Pest Control Pony Don't worry. With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch. 
    Apple Bloom The touch? Oh, sorry. 
    Pest Control Pony Now, you're gonna need to be quick. Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking. 
     
    Apple Bloom Wait, what do you mean? 
     
    Apple Bloom Ow! 
    Pest Control Pony Hah, told you! And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get! 
    Apple Bloom What do I do?! 
    Pest Control Pony Call 'em back, of course. 
    Apple Bloom Twittermites!  
     
    Apple Bloom Twittermites! 
     
    Apple Bloom Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug! 
     
    Pest Control Pony Well, looks like you're all set. Drop me a note sometime at the Piney Shade Retirement Community. 
    Apple Bloom Now, hold on! I'm sure this job is real important, but... I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life. Hey, where'd he go? 
    Diamond Tiara Well, well, well! Look at the new bug pony! 
    Apple Bloom It's pest pony. 
    Silver Spoon Ew, it sure is! Ew! 
    Diamond Tiara I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
    Silver Spoon But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one! 
    Apple Bloom That's not funny. 
    Diamond Tiara Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend! 
    Apple Bloom Stop it! 
    Silver Spoon Here, bug! Here, bug! Will you be my friend, bug? Because nopony else will!  
    Apple Bloom You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are! 
    Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon  
     

    Apple Bloom  I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for. 
    Mysterious Voice Why should you have to keep it, then? 
    Apple Bloom Who's there?! What do you mean?! 
    Mysterious Voice If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it! 
    Apple Bloom Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead! 
    Mysterious Voice As easily said as done. 
     
    Apple Bloom Huh. Now that is some serious magic. 

     
    Apple Bloom Hey! Where's everypony goin'?! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Mayor! What's goin' on?! 
    Mayor Mare Apple Bloom, you've got to get your family out of town! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Twittermites!  
     
    Apple Bloom Twittermites! Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug! 
     
    Apple Bloom Here, bugs! 
     
    Apple Bloom Come on, here! 
    Applejack Apple Bloom! What in tarnation are you doin'?! 
    Apple Bloom I'm tryin' to stop the infestation, of course! 
    Applejack Only a pest pony can do that! Now come on! We gotta skedaddle! 
    Apple Bloom But I've gotta do somethin'! 
    Applejack Are you crazy?! 
     
     

    Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom Aaaaaaahhh! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real. 
    Applejack  Breakfast! 

    Apple Bloom Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought! 
    Applejack See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just aboutâ€”  Well, no wonder you were so worked up! 
    Apple Bloom What? 
    Applejack Looks like somepony got her cutie mark! 
    Apple Bloom Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it! 
    Applejack More like what? 
    Apple Bloom Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off! 
    Applejack I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark. But before you go, make sure you do all your... chores...? 

     
    Apple Bloom Whooo! 
    Scootaloo Why all the excitement? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah, what's going on? 
    Apple Bloom  Oh, nothin'... except this brand new cutie mark! 
    Scootaloo That's amazing! 
    Sweetie Belle Wow! 
    Apple Bloom I know! 
    Scootaloo That's so cool! 
    Apple Bloom I don't suppose either of you got yours? 
    Scootaloo Nope. 
    Sweetie Belle Me neither... 
    Apple Bloom I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together. 
    Scootaloo Me too... 
    Sweetie Belle But I'm still super excited for you! 
    Scootaloo Absolutely! 
    Apple Bloom I know!  Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks. 
    Sweetie Belle Um, yeah... the thing is... 
    Apple Bloom What? 
    Scootaloo Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark... 
    Apple Bloom Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do... 
    Sweetie Belle Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only. 
    Apple Bloom Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...? 
    Sweetie Belle Why? I mean, you can't come in then either. 
    Apple Bloom Oh. 
    Sweetie Belle Rules are rules. 
    Scootaloo I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends. 
     
    Apple Bloom What?! 
     
    Apple Bloom Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny! 
     
    Mysterious Voice More trouble with cutie marks? 
    Apple Bloom No! I mean, wâ€” yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble! 
    Mysterious Voice Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod. 
    Apple Bloom I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem! 
    Mysterious Voice Your wish is my command. 
     

     
    Scootaloo Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here? 
    Apple Bloom Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere! 
    Scootaloo Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks. 
    Apple Bloom You did?! What are they? 
    Scootaloo Oh, we don't have time to go into all that. 
    Sweetie Belle And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, we've got responsibilities now. 
    Sweetie Belle But maybe we'll see you later. 
    Scootaloo Much later. 
    Apple Bloom Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo! 
     
    Apple Bloom What in Equestria's goin' on?! 
    Applejack  Breakfast! 
    Apple Bloom I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is. 

    Apple Bloom Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse. 
    Applejack See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fixâ€” Well, no wonder you were so worked up... 
    Apple Bloom Whâ€” Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying toâ€” 
    Granny Smith Weeeell, what do we have here? 
    Apple Bloom What is it, Granny? What's wrong?! 
    Granny Smith Oh, nothin', right, Applejack? 
    Applejack Right... Nothin' at all... Right, Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark. 
    Applejack Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, no! What is it now?! 
     
    Big McIntosh  Well, I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't no apple. 
    Granny Smith Nnope! 
    Apple Bloom What?! 
    Applejack  And we don't have room for non-apples. 
    Big McIntosh  Nnope. 
    Granny Smith  Time for you to mosey on. You can't stay here. 
    Apple Bloom But this is my home! 
    Big McIntosh Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name. 
    Granny Smith Eeyup! 
    Big McIntosh I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack? 
    Applejack Eeyup! 
     
    Apple Bloom Noooooooooo! 

     
    Apple Bloom Ugh! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Apple Bloom Alright, this is getting ridiculous.  Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark. What the?! 
     
    Apple Bloom  I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live! 
    Mysterious Voice Back so soon? 
    Apple Bloom All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now! 
    Mysterious Voice I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else. I only did what you wanted. 
    Apple Bloom Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?! 
    Mysterious Voice You didn't want to catch bugs, and I helped. You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped. If there's a problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too. 
    Apple Bloom I don't want your help! Just get away from me! 
    Princess Luna Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow. 
    Apple Bloom Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself? 
    Princess Luna Of course, Apple Bloom. It's your dream. 
    Apple Bloom If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up? 
    Princess Luna Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare. I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark. 
    Princess Luna Well, that is the same as worrying about who you are. That is all a cutie mark is. If you cannot accept who you are, your life might seem like a bad dream.  
    Apple Bloom But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too? 
    Princess Luna Of course. 
    Apple Bloom Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is! 
    Princess Luna Indeed. 
    Apple Bloom But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark. 
    Princess Luna Oh, I wouldn't say that. 
     
    Sweetie Belle  
     
     
     
     
     
    Scootaloo  
     
    Scootaloo  
    Apple Bloom Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too? 
    Princess Luna It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close. 
     
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Princess Luna! 
    Princess Luna I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake. 
    Sweetie Belle We're still asleep? 
    Scootaloo Cool! 
    Apple Bloom Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order! 
     
    Apple Bloom I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours! 
    Scootaloo Me neither! 
    Apple Bloom And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us! 
    Sweetie Belle It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are! 
    Princess Luna And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T. 
    Apple Bloom Exactly! 
    Scootaloo Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff? 
    Apple Bloom I know! Let's put together a care package for her! 
    Sweetie Belle That way she'll know she isn't alone! 
    Apple Bloom We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up. 
    Princess Luna Good idea. 

    Apple Bloom  
     
    Apple Bloom  

     
    

        There ain't no call to worry 
        So don't you cry or fret 

    

        A cutie mark won't change me 
        No matter what I get 

    Applejack Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better. 
    Apple Bloom You have no idea. 
    Applejack See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'. 
    Apple Bloom I guess so. I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'. 

     

Tanks for the Memories

    Rainbow Dash Look at that, Tank! Cloudsdale's here! That means Ponyville is next up for winter! 
     
    Rainbow Dash You're doing awesome, everypony! Keep it up! We need those leaves off those trees! Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter! 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash Was that a yawn I just saw? 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner? And don't forget the best part â€“ our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding!  And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Everything's looking great, don't you think? 
    Rainbow Dash Almost everything. Does Tank look alright to you? 
    Tank  
    Twilight Sparkle Well, he does seem to be moving a little slowly. 
    Rainbow Dash I know, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle And he looks kind of sleepy... 
    Rainbow Dash Totally! 
    Twilight Sparkle ...just like he always does. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right. 
    Tank  

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Well?! 
    Fluttershy I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual... 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, so give him a vitamin or something! 
    Tank  
    Fluttershy I don't think he needs that. 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe we're just staying up too late. Uh, too many Daring Do stories. 
    Fluttershy Oh, that's not it either. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, what's wrong with him then?! 
    Fluttershy Nothing! He's perfectly fine. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy He's just going to hibernate. 
    Rainbow Dash You do realize he's not a bear, right? 
    Fluttershy  When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground. 
    Tank  
    Fluttershy But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke. 
    Fluttershy It's not a joke. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, then your book must be wrong! 
    Fluttershy Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate. It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us. 
    Rainbow Dash  Whatever. Okay, thanks. Come on, Tank. 
    Fluttershy Where are you going? 
    Rainbow Dash To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert. 

    Spike I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon! 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash Come on! You're practically twins! 
     
    Spike I'm purple. 
    Rainbow Dash But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?! 
    Spike Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon! 
    Rainbow Dash Same family though, right? 
    Spike No! 
    Rainbow Dash I'll take that as a yes. 
    Spike Ugh! Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiberâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Well, what would you know?! You're a dragon! 
     

    Rainbow Dash Nopony knows you like I do, Tank. All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping. 
    Tank  
     
    Rainbow Dash Come on! 

    Rainbow Dash  These things are heavy! Chock full of snowflakes! We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank. Tank? Tank! 
    Pinkie Pie Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibernâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Don't say that word! 
    Pinkie Pie Which one? "Snuggly"? "Wuggly"? "Tankie"? "Hibernate"? 
    Rainbow Dash That one! 
    Pinkie Pie I was just saying how cute heâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash If you think hiber... â€“ you know, that napping thing â€“ is so cute, why don't you go do it?! Somewhere far away from here?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  What are you looking at?! Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation! 
    Twilight Sparkle Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiberâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Shhhh! Don't say that word! That's what started this all! 
    Twilight Sparkle We all know how upset you are about Tank. But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends. 
    Rainbow Dash Who said anything about anger?! I didn't say anything about anger! I'm not upset! And I am not angry! Do I look angry?!  Come on, Tank! Let's get out of here! 

    Rainbow Dash I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed! Which... is exactly what you are. But get up anyway! 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash You can't hiberâ€“ you know. What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter? Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire. 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash Don't you wanna do those things with me?! Think, Rainbow Dash, think! Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right? Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold...  I just have to stop winter! 

    Sunshower So where do these clouds go? 
    Open Skies Over by Clear Skies. 
    Sunshower But there's clear skies everywhere. 
    Clear Skies Yo, Clear Skies right here! 
    Sunshower But there's clear skies over there, too! 
    Clear Skies That's Open Skies! 
    Sunshower There's open skies everywhere! 
    Open Skies I'm not everywhere. I'm right here! 
    Sunshower  Wait. So you're Open Skies, and you're Clear Skies. Then what's all that? 
    Clear Skies and Open Skies Open, clear skies! 
    Open Skies Hey, where'd our fluffy clouds go? 
    Clear Skies Fluffy Clouds? He's over there! 
    Rainbow Dash Hah! Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze! 
     
     

    

        When life gives you lemons 
        You can make lemonade 
        But life gave me Tank here 
        And my choice has long been made 

        No winter will come to Ponyville 
        I'll do it on my own 
        I will keep you by my side 
        So I will not be alone 

        And I'll fly, and I'll fly 
        Until the end of the sky 
        So I'll be the one who doesn't 
        Have to say goodbye 

        I'll clear the skies forever 
        So we won't be apart 
        I'll keep the weather warm for you 
        And the winter will never start 

        Weather-makers Pegasi 
        You make the seasons in the sky 
        I don't want to sabotage you 
        But you see, I've got to try 

        No winter can come here now 
        I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow 
        I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be 
        For I need my friend and he needs me 

        I know it's wrong, but what does it matter? 
        'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now 
        I'll change it all, it's only the weather 
        And nopony's gonna bring me down 

        I'll keep the sunlight shining free 
        And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me 

        And I'll fly, and I'll fly 
        Until the end of the sky 
        So I'll be the one who doesn't 
        Have to say goodbye 

        I'll clear the skies forever 
        So we won't be apart 
        I'll keep the weather warm for you 
        And the winter will never start! 

    Tank  
    Sunshower Here comes the next shipment! Move those clouds over! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward! What are we gonna do?  Cloudsdale. That's it, Tank! If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source! 
     

     
    Tank  
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Lunch hour! Perfect! 

     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash The winter lab. We're in, Tank! Now we just gotta figure out a way to shut it down. Sabotage snowflakes? I think we gotta go bigger than that. Wait here. Hmm. We could get rid of these clouds, but... that's still not big enough.  
     
    Rainbow Dash Slam dunk! With no water, they can't make clouds or snow! They can't make winter! 
     
    Rainbow Dash I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oopsies! Looks like these were a little loose! 
     
    Rainbow Dash And there goes winter down the drain! 
     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I can't see! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Aaaaaah! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Let's get out of here! 
     
     
     
    Applejack What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Prepare yourselves, everypony! Winter is coming! 

     
    Noteworthy  
    Parasol  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony, look out! 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy  
     
    Rainbow Dash  You okay, Tank? 
    Tank  
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash! Are you alright? 
    Rainbow Dash  No... 

    Tank  
     
    Pinkie Pie Knock, knock! 
    Fluttershy How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash  Whatever... 
    Rarity The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what we can do. 
    Applejack Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days. 
    Rainbow Dash  Whatever... 
    Rarity Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash. 
    Pinkie Pie I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...!  A party pooper! 
    Rainbow Dash Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine. 
    Fluttershy Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Whatever did you do that for?! 
    Fluttershy Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months. 
    Rainbow Dash Months?!  
    Applejack Alright, alright. There, there.  Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop? 
    Fluttershy  She's got to be about done by now. Can't be too much left in there. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy Feeling better? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy Oh, you poor, poor thing...  
    Rarity  I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry! 
    Pinkie Pie  It's just heart-wrenching! 
    Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle  You too?! 
    Applejack Nope, I'm good. 
    Twilight Sparkle Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbyeâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie  I'm mostly sad because you're not sad! 
    Twilight Sparkle What?! Me?! What about Applejack? 
    Pinkie Pie  Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight! 
    Applejack It's true. 
    Rainbow Dash  It's alright, Fluttershy. It's alright. 
    Applejack  You think she's done or just getting a third wind? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know... Rainbow Dash? Are you okay? 
    Rainbow Dash  Oh, Tank... I'm sure gonna miss you. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang. 
    Applejack The fun's come early! Yee-haw! 
     
    Pinkie Pie You think we could mess up winter every year? It's way less work! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it. 
    Rainbow Dash Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome. 
    Tank  
    Rainbow Dash I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!' party! 
    Rarity And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being. 
    Applejack I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, me too. 
     
    Rainbow Dash So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh? 
    Rarity Goodbye, Tank. 
    Fluttershy Happy winter. 
    Applejack See you later, little feller. 
    Pinkie Pie Have a good sleep, Tank! 
    Twilight Sparkle Goodbye, Tank! We'll miss you! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well? Ready for some winter fun? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit. That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story. I'll be right there. 

     

Appleoosa's Most Wanted

    Apple Bloom Aren't you glad y'all came with me to see Applejack compete in the Appleloosa rodeo? 
    Scootaloo Totally! This place is a cutie mark gold mine! There's barrel racing... 
     
    Scootaloo ...roping contests, rodeo clowning... 
     
    Scootaloo ...steeplechase...! 
    Apple Bloom If we can get into some of these events, we could all three walk off the train back in Ponyville with brand spankin' new cutie marks! 
    Scootaloo Wouldn't a barrel look good here? 
    Apple Bloom I want a lasso! 
    Sweetie Belle I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous. 
    Apple Bloom No risk, no reward. 
    Sheriff Silverstar Alright, everypony, listen up! We need a big presence at this here rodeo, so make yourself plenty seen! I want that low-down varmint to know we mean business! 
    Sweetie Belle I hope nothing bad is going on. 
    Apple Bloom A cutie mark-apalooza and a low-down varmint? This is shapin' up to be the most excitin' rodeo ever! 
    Scootaloo Yeah, come on! 
     

     

     
    Braeburn Woo-hoo! Yee-haw! That's my cousin! Go, Applejack, go! 
    Applejack Whew! It's been a dog's age since I got to compete. All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason. 
    Braeburn Well, I guess havin' injured kinfolk in Appleloosa sure paid off then, huh, cuz? 
    Applejack Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn. 
    Braeburn Keep tossin' like that and I'll be out of a job! 
     
    Braeburn Ow, ow! 
    Applejack Ooh, sorry. Say, where's my sister and her friends? 
    Braeburn Uh-oh. Gee, uh, I guess I got so caught up watchin' you that Iâ€” 
    Applejack You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies! How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonnaâ€” 
    Braeburn There they are! Heh, right where I left 'em... Aw, don't be mad!  Owwwwch! My foreleg! Hurts so much...! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Applejack Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear? Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground! 
    Apple Bloom Sorry, Applejack. We won't wander off again. But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo... what would you say about me and the Crusaders maybe competin' in one teensy-weensy little event or three? 
    Braeburn Look out! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Applejack  What the hay just happened? 
    Braeburn You fillies alright? 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Uh-huh... 
    Sweetie Belle  Yeah... 
    Sheriff Silverstar Sugar and salt licks! Well, I'll be... 
    Applejack What is it, Sheriff? 
    Braeburn Is it him? 
    Sheriff Silverstar Ain't no doubt. It's Trouble Shoes. 
    Caramel  
    Sheriff Silverstar  

    Crowd  
    Townspony 1 Is it true? Is Trouble Shoes here? 
    Townspony 2 You ain't gonna shut down the rodeo, are ya?! 
    Sheriff Silverstar All right now, I called for a meetin', not a mob scene. Now, as many of you know, the Equestria rodeo circuit has been plagued by the dirty dealin's of a notorious outlaw. 
    Townspony 3 He knocked barrels every which way at the Hoof City rodeo! Nearly crushed my Aunt Bae Mare! 
    Townspony 4 That's nothin'! He sabotaged the steer pen at Pinto Creek rodeo, settin' off such a stampede they cancelled the whole dadgum thing! 
    Crowd  
    Sheriff Silverstar Now, now, it's true we had an incident this mornin' at our own Appleloosa rodeo. Hay bale stack came down right near on top of three little fillies! I examined them hoof-prints myself and, uh... it was Trouble Shoes, all right. 
    Crowd  
    Sheriff Silverstar I reckon I oughta cancel this rodeo like all the others done. But dag-hoof it, this has gone far enough! We'll double the patrols! This rodeo will go on! Appleloosa ain't gonna be intimidated! 
     
    Apple Bloom Glad that's settled. So, uh, Applejack, about me and my pals competin' in the rodeo...  

    Apple Bloom Don't send us home! It's not fair! 
    Applejack Now, quit yer bellyachin'. I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose. Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too. 
    Braeburn No, you can't! This rodeo is important to Appleloosa! And with you in there, we got a real shot at winnin'! Come on, now, you head on back to practice and don't worry none about these three. I won't let 'em outta my sight. 
     
    Braeburn  Ya hear? Y'all ain't leavin' my sight! 

    Braeburn  
     
    Sweetie Belle I thought we weren't going to wander off again. 
    Apple Bloom This ain't wanderin'. We know exactly where we're headed â€“ to find Trouble Shoes! 
    Sweetie Belle But isn't he a dangerous criminal? 
    Apple Bloom We only need to find him. We don't need to capture him. The sheriff can handle that! 
    Scootaloo And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's... 
    Apple Bloom and Scootaloo Cutie mark city! 
    Sweetie Belle Worst idea ever. 

     
    Apple Bloom It's another giant hoof print! 
    Sweetie Belle Do either of you have any idea where we are? 
     
     
    Scootaloo Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later. 
    Apple Bloom C'mon, before we lose the trail! 
     
    Sweetie Belle  

    Sweetie Belle Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back! 
    Scootaloo The rain is only getting worse, Apple Bloom! Let's come back tomorrow. 
    Apple Bloom Maybe y'all are right. So, how do we get back? 
    Sweetie Belle You mean you don't know?! 
     

    Applejack Whew! Good job, y'all. I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm. 
    Braeburn  
    Applejack Braeburn? Where are the girls? 
    Braeburn  
    Applejack  What?! 

    Sheriff Silverstar Ha! Fish my wish! 
    Star Spur Aw! 
    Senior Deputy Dagnabbit! 
    Applejack Sheriff Silverstar! You gotta help! My sister's gone! And her friends too! 
    Braeburn I've searched and searched, but no sign of 'em anywhere! 
    Applejack It must've been Trouble Shoes! 
    Sheriff Silverstar Now, now, hold on there. Trouble Shoes done a lot of bad things in his day, but nothin' like that! 
    Applejack You really wanna take that chance? 
    Sheriff Silverstar Come on, y'all! Let's ride! 

    Sweetie Belle You sure about this, Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo I thought I was, but now I'm not. 
    Apple Bloom So I pretty much got us completely and totally lost. How could this get any worse? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
    Apple Bloom We gotta get out of this rain. There's no tellin' how long this storm could last. 
    Scootaloo Look! 
    Apple Bloom It looks abandoned. Let's go see if we can find some blankets or somethin'. 
     
     
     
     
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Trouble Shoes  
     
    Trouble Shoes  
     
     
    Trouble Shoes  
    Apple Bloom  Hello? You alright? 
    Trouble Shoes Surely. 
    Apple Bloom We didn't mean no harm. We just came in to get out of the rain. 
    Trouble Shoes Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived. 
     
    Trouble Shoes I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance. My lot in life, I suppose. 
    Apple Bloom Are you... Trouble Shoes? 
    Trouble Shoes That's me. 
    Scootaloo W-what are you doing? 
    Apple Bloom I'm gonna unwrap him. 
    Sweetie Belle You can't do that! That's Trouble Shoes! 
    Apple Bloom Aw, he don't seem so bad. 
     
    Trouble Shoes Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes. Wh-whooaaa! 
     
    Trouble Shoes Typical. Bad luck never rests. 
    Apple Bloom You sure that's bad luck? Seems like maybe you're just a little, um... 
    Sweetie Belle Klutzy? 
    Trouble Shoes Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe â€“ bad luck. Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk. Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all. Get along! Skedaddle! 
     
    Trouble Shoes Am-scray! 
    Scootaloo Um, we don't really know the way back to Appleloosa... 
    Trouble Shoes But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day. 

    Sweetie Belle It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this. 
    Scootaloo I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it. 
    Apple Bloom Say there, Trouble Shoes, you might not want to take us all the way back to Appleloosa. The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that you're a no-good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo. 
    Trouble Shoes My kind of luck he'd think that. 
    Apple Bloom But... is it true? 
    Trouble Shoes Y'all like stories? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Mm-hmm! 
    Trouble Shoes Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no.  When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it. 
     
    Young Trouble Shoes Whoooa! 
    Buffalo  
    Young Trouble Shoes  Awww! 
    Buffalo  
    Trouble Shoes  I practiced and practiced... 
    Young Trouble Shoes Whoooa-oof! 
    Trouble Shoes  And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school. Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to. And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark. 
     
     
    Judges  
    Trouble Shoes  I can still remember them judges a-laughin'. Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate. That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em. So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it? Bad luck would strike again. Just my lot in life, I reckon... 
    Sweetie Belle Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that. 
    Apple Bloom Don't you see? They weren't laughin' at him. They were just enjoyin' the show. 
    Scootaloo What are you saying? 
    Apple Bloom Think about it. If we saw a rodeo clown doin' what he did back in that shack, we'd think he was the greatest! 
    Sweetie Belle You're right! He could still be in rodeos, just not the way he thought! 
    Scootaloo So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it'sâ€” 
    Sheriff Silverstar Gotcha! 
    Trouble Shoes Just my luck. 
    Sheriff Silverstar Trouble Shoes, you're under arrest for vandalizin' the property and peace of mind of the good rodeo-lovin' ponies of Equestria! Not to mention fillynappin'! And... generalized mayhem! 
    Apple Bloom Wait! 
    Applejack Braeburn? Get these fillies someplace safe. 
    Apple Bloom Wait, no! Listen, Applejack! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders No! 

    Apple Bloom But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace everypony thinks! 
    Applejack Sakes alive, what's with you? Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?! Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack. 
    Apple Bloom Um, Applejack? 
     

    Trouble Shoes  Well, at least I get me a view of one small corner of the rodeo. 
     
    Trouble Shoes Figures. 
    Sheriff Silverstar Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes! I'm runnin' out of mattresses! 
     
     
     
    Apple Bloom Come on, sheriff! You're about to miss the hay bale monster stack! 
    Sheriff Silverstar Jiminy, that's startin' already?! 
     
    Apple Bloom Let's go, Trouble Shoes! This here's a jailbreak! 
    Trouble Shoes Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage. 
    Scootaloo But we've got a plan to help you live your dream! 
    Trouble Shoes Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo? 
     

     
     
    Apple Bloom Go, Applejack! 
    Scootaloo  You can do it! 
    Sweetie Belle  Woo-hoo! 
    Trouble Shoes Well, how do I look? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Trouble Shoes Come on now, stack them bales! Woo-hoo! 
     
     
     
    Apple Bloom That's my sister! 
     
    Apple Bloom 'Kay now, Trouble Shoes, you're on! 
    Trouble Shoes Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown. 
    Apple Bloom You got your cutie mark all wrong, Trouble Shoes! You were born to entertain! You've got a gift for makin' folks laugh, don't you? 
    Trouble Shoes But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck. 
    Sweetie Belle That all depends on how you look at it. 
    Apple Bloom You always wanted to be a part of the rodeo, right? Well, now's your chance. Go on! 
    Trouble Shoes Whoa! 
     
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Applejack There y'all are! How 'bout your big sis, huh? 
    Apple Bloom  Yeah, way to go. 
    Applejack Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns? 
     
     
    Trouble Shoes Just leave me be, cutie mark! I aim to clear that there hoop! 
     
     
    Trouble Shoes  
     
     
     
    Applejack That's the best rodeo clown I ever seen!  
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
     
     
     
     
     
    Crowd Trouble Shoes! 
    Applejack What the hay?! 
    Female Townspony #1 He escaped from jail! 
    Male Townspony #1 Ruinin' another rodeo! 
    Female Townspony #2 Let's get him! 
     
    Apple Bloom Wait, y'all! He ain't what you think he is! 
    Sheriff Silverstar Stand aside, young'uns! This one's goin' back to jail. 
    Sweetie Belle But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents! 
    Applejack Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about? 
    Scootaloo Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen! 
    Judge That's true! He is awful funny. 
    Apple Bloom He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, but deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be. He just didn't know how to do it. 
     
    Trouble Shoes What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'. I know it now. I didn't mean no harm, honest! I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo, so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things. Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong. 
    Sheriff Silverstar That may be so, Trouble Shoes, but you still gotta face charges for the problems you've caused! 
    Trouble Shoes If I done wrong, I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts. 
    Sheriff Silverstar Truth be told, we could understand all the trouble with the rodeos, but why'd you have to run off with these here little'uns last night? 
    Apple Bloom Uh, yeah, about that... 

     
     
    Apple Bloom  You really want us to clean up all this mess Trouble Shoes made? 
    Applejack Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to! 
    Apple Bloom Ugh. Ain't it bad enough that you get to go back to Ponyville with a shiny trophy, and all we're bringing back is these same old blank flanks? 
    Applejack Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means. Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you? 
    Sweetie Belle I guess we did make things a little better. 
    Scootaloo It does feel kinda nice. 
    Apple Bloom So... we can stop now? 
    Applejack Nnope. 

     

Make New Friends but Keep Discord

    Discord Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling! 
    Fluttershy  Oh, I do love our Tuesday teas, and I can't wait for you to meet my friend Tree Hugger. She's going to love you too. 
    Discord Tree Hugger?  
    Fluttershy I met her on a trip to see the Breezies. She's a member of the Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures. 
    Discord How nice for you.  
    Fluttershy We're all gonna have so much fun together at the Grand Galloping Gala! 
    Discord Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to. 
    Fluttershy Oh. Oh, no. Um, I'm afraid I've already asked Tree Hugger. I'm sorry, Discord. I assumed you'd have your own ticket since you and Princess Celestia are friends now. Were you not invited? 
    Discord Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go! 
    Fluttershy But we haven't had any of our Tuesday teacakes. 
    Discord Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta. 
     

     

    Spike  Gah! 
    Discord Where's Twilight? 
    Spike Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping Princess Celestia with the Gala! 
     
    Spike  

    Rarity Oh, your first Grand Galloping Gala! The excitement, the anticipation! I wouldn't miss this for all the jewels in Equestria! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala! 
    Applejack Alright, y'all, keep it down. It ain't like it's a life-changin' experience or nothiiiiing...  
    Rainbow Dash Hey! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Discord I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they? 
    Apple Bloom  
    Rarity Ahem! To answer your rather rude question, they're going as our dates, our plus-ones. 
    Sweetie Belle  We're plus-ones! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  We're plus ones! We're plus-ones! 
    Discord Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! 

    Pinkie Pie Have a wonderful, special, fantastic day! Oh, hi, Discord. Want some cake? 
     
    Pinkie Pie I can give you a list of all the flavors we have in order of most delicious to incredibly, unbelievably delicious! 
    Discord Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes. 
    Pinkie Pie All of them?! He wants all of the cakes! 
     
    Discord Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, of course! I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my mom, but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course! Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else? My sister Maud! 
    Discord You know what? Cancel my order. 
     
    Pinkie Pie You want none of the cakes now?! 

    Fluttershy  Oh, my, you are funny! 
    Discord I guess every being in Equestria is funny today. 
    Fluttershy Oh, how rude of me. Tree Hugger, this is Discord. Discord, Tree Hugger. 
    Tree Hugger Radical to meet you. Really digging your vibe. 
    Discord My vibe? 
    Fluttershy It's a compliment. 
    Discord Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off. 
     
    Discord It has nothing to do with seeing you or not seeing you. You can rest assured of that.  
     
    Discord Have fun at the Gala! 
     
    Tree Hugger Righteous! 

    Discord "Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!" 
     
     
    Discord "No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway! 
    Parcel Post  
    Discord Are you perhaps looking for me? 
    Parcel Post Are you "Discord or current resident"? I can't find any street numbers in this place. 
    Discord My ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! I was invited after all! 
     
    Discord  Why is this so late? 
    Parcel Post Well, I got a little lost after I escaped the flying badgers... Can you point me in the direction of the bottomless pit? I think I can make my way back from there. 
    Discord Oh, over there. Somewhere. Just go over there. Looks like I'll see you at the Gala after all, Fluttershy. But I can't show up alone. She'll think that she's my only friend. Who could I bring on such short notice?  

    Princess Celestia I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala. 
    Twilight Sparkle Anything I can do to make it easier on you. 
    Princess Celestia Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once. 
     
    Announcer Announcing the spirit of chaos, Discord, and his guest, the, uh... 
    Discord  
    Announcer The Smooze! 
    The Smooze  
    Ponies  
    Discord Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair! 
    The Smooze  
    Discord He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll take care of this. 
    The Smooze  
    Twilight Sparkle  What are you doing here with... that?! 
    Discord Now, now, now. The Smooze may be an "it", but it's an it with a heart of, well, blob. 
    The Smooze  
    Twilight Sparkle This night is extremely important to me, Discord.  Keep it under control! 
    Discord Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere? 

    Cutie Mark Crusaders We're here! We're here! We made it to the Gala! 
    Fluttershy  
    Tree Hugger The aura coming off the waterfall was so alive! So, like, magic manifestation. 
    Fluttershy Wow. 
    Discord Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there. 
    Fluttershy How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall? 
    Discord  
    Fluttershy Discord! I thought you weren't coming! 
    Discord No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange. 
    Tree Hugger Nice to meet you. I'm Tree Hugger. Blessings. 
    Discord You have met me before actually!  
    Tree Hugger Cool! Like, in another life, maybe? 
    Discord You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me? 
    Tree Hugger  I meet a lot of different creatures, each one of them perfect and unique. 
    Discord Yes, well, as I was saying, it's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend. 
    Fluttershy Am I really your oldest, bestest friend? 
    Discord You?  Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator â€“ well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace? 
    Tree Hugger Oh, I like that! It's so in rhythm with my life force!  Maybe I'll change it! 
     
    Fluttershy  I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before. Sounds like you two are so close. 
    Discord Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are. 
     
    Discord Very close. 
    Fluttershy That's wonderful! The four of us should go out to dinner sometime! 
     
    Discord We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart? 
    Pony  
    Discord Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit. 
    Fluttershy Oh, okay. Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later! 
    Discord Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think? 
     
    Pony  
    Discord Smoozie! Wait up! 

    Discord Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you. 
     
    Apple Bloom, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo and Tree Hugger  
     
    Discord  
    Tree Hugger What's so funny? 
    Discord Exactly! 
    Rainbow Dash Uhh... I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor. 
    Discord Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together. 
    Fluttershy Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes. 
    Discord Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger. 
    Tree Hugger I got that you really like cake. 
    Discord We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake. 
    Rarity  Let me in! 
     
     
    Rarity  That creature took my jewels! 
    The Smooze  
    Twilight Sparkle Discord! I thought I told you to keep your friend under control! 
    Discord Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night.  What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you. It's alright, everypony. Let's just get back to enjoying this magical evening! 
    Discord  You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over. 
     
    The Smooze  

     
    Fluttershy  Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you! 
    Ponies  
     
    Discord Check, check, check. Is this thing on? Good evening, fillies and germs! I just flew into Canterlot, and wow, are my interspecies parts tired! 
     
     
    Discord I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! 
    Princess Celestia  
    Discord  Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor. 
     
    Discord Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there? 
     
    "Masquerade"  
    Discord Tough crowd. 
    Twilight Sparkle What is he doing?! 
    Rainbow Dash I think they're... jokes? 
    Pinkie Pie Maud! Jokes! 
    Maud Pie My favorite. 
    Discord  Knock knock! 
     
    Discord You're supposed to say "Who's there?"! This is the most basic of jokes! 
     
    Maud Pie You're the most basic of jokes. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Good one, Maud! 
     
    The Smooze  
    Twilight Sparkle What is that?! 

     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle None of my magic works on this ooze! Can you stop it? 
     
    Princess Celestia I'm afraid not! 
    Twilight Sparkle Discord, how could you bring him here?! 
    Discord Oh, he's not that bad! 
    Rarity Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever! 
    Applejack That's what you're worried about? Really? 
     
    Tree Hugger This is kind of a bummer. 
    Discord Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one. 
    Tree Hugger Seems like something might have harshed his flow, you know? Like, his senses are agitated. 
    Discord You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo! 
    Tree Hugger All he needs is some, like, calming auditory therapy. I know I always feel really at peace when I'm being bathed in positive vibes. Maybe he'll calm down with some sonic bliss. 
    Discord Do you even know what you just said? 
    Tree Hugger Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! 
    The Smooze  
    Tree Hugger Let go, Smooze! Bliss out! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! 
    The Smooze  
    Sweetie Belle It worked! 
    Everypony  
    Rainbow Dash Way to go, Tree Hugger! 
    Fluttershy That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals! 
    Discord  
    Tree Hugger Oh, thanks, everypony. It makes perfect karmic sense why magic doesn't work on him. He only responds to vibrations that peace out his energy fields. 
    Discord Stop it! Stop it! That's it! I'm done with you, Tree Hugger! 
    Tree Hugger Oh, man. You're really bumming me out. Can you just, like, lower your voice a skosh? 
    Discord A skosh? A skosh?! 
     
    Tree Hugger Whoa, dude! What is that?! 
    Discord Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore! 
    Fluttershy Discord, stop! 
    Discord I will, just as soon as she's gone! Then we can have a good laugh about this whole affair over our regular Tuesday tea.  
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Fluttershy! We'll stop him! 
     
    Main cast sans Fluttershy  
    Discord I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days? 
    Fluttershy I don't understand why you're doing this! We were all getting along so well! 
    Discord As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all! 
    Fluttershy Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?! 
    Discord Yes, because that's what you did! 
    Fluttershy No, Discord! I invited a friend to a party! I didn't abandon you! What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with? Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?! 
    Discord Uh...  No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh. 
    Fluttershy More like a lot of skoshes! Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute? 
    Discord I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks. 
    Fluttershy Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology? Not me! 
    Discord Oh! Oh.  
     
    The Smooze  
     
    Discord Er, Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my... er, you know... wrath. 
    Tree Hugger Oh, it's all groovy. Um, I need like a few minutes to clear out my chakras before I can hug you from a place of authenticity. 
    Discord Oh, your chakras.  Fair enough. 

    Discord I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours. 
    The Smooze  
    Discord Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing. 
    Maud Pie I like it too. 
    Pinkie Pie Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom!  Come on, Smoozinator! Let's dance! 
    The Smooze  
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Princess Celestia. I thought I could give you a break tonight, but it turns out I was in over my head. 
    Princess Celestia You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, it was aâ€”What?! But there was ooze all over the place! And one of the guests threatened to send somepony to another dimension! 
    Princess Celestia I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young! 

     

The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone

    Pinkie Pie La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be amazing! 
    Gummy  
    Pinkie Pie Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream... 
     
    Pinkie Pie An hour per layer â€“ that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark!  The map! 
    Gummy  
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you...  ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I know you can do this, Gummy! You're the best alligator baker I've ever met!  
     
    Gummy  

     

    Twilight Sparkle This is so exciting. The map is summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I don't know if either of you have read "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", but griffons were known to beâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Rude, insensitive bullies? 
    Twilight Sparkle You mean Gilda? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie She was a bit of a party pooper. 
    Rainbow Dash Mm-hmm. 
    Twilight Sparkle So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history!  In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land. 
    Rainbow Dash And why do you care so much about griffons anyway? 
    Twilight Sparkle It was actually Gilda's visit that made me curious. So I picked up "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", and I've been hooked ever since! And now...  Now you two get to see Griffonstone with your very own eyes. 
    Pinkie Pie Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, you can totally take my place if you want.  I still have half a nap to finish. 
    Pinkie Pie Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess. 
    Pinkie Pie Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone! 
    Rainbow Dash  Fine... 
    Pinkie Pie That's the spirit!  

     
     
    Pinkie Pie Whatcha reading, Rainbow? 
    Rainbow Dash  Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone. 
    Pinkie Pie You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix? 
    Rainbow Dash And then some. It's like Twilight herself in book form.  "Always carry plenty of bits. The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth." 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  Uh, can I borrow some bits? 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best. 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is... 
     
    Pinkie Pie ...a total dump! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us. 
    Pinkie Pie Excuse me, sir? This is Griffonstone, right? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Well, that wasn't very nice. 
    Rainbow Dash See? These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be. 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on. 
    Gilda We don't have a king, losers. 
    Rainbow Dash Hello, Gilda. 
    Gilda Dash. 
    Pinkie Pie Pinkie! 
    Rainbow Dash What are you doing here? 
    Gilda Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs? 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone! 
    Gilda Help it what? 
    Pinkie Pie Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, andâ€” 
    Gilda Bored now! 
    Pinkie Pie Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is? 
    Gilda Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really believe in that thing. 
    Grampa Gruff You'd better believe in it!  
     
     
    Grampa Gruff It was the best thing to ever happen to us griffons! 
    Gilda Oh, great. Now you got Grampa Gruff started! 
    Grampa Gruff I'll tell you the whole tragic tale...  ...for a couple of bits. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Grampa Gruff The first griffon king, King Grover, united our kind like we've never been united before or since! And he did it all with that incredible Idol of Boreas. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Grampa Gruff That idol brought pride to the heart of every griffon that saw it! From one king to the next, Griffonstone had our golden idol. We were the envy of all other species.  It held us together â€“ it gave us an identity â€“ right up until the reign of King Guto. 
     
    Grampa Gruff  That's when Arimaspi came to steal our griffon treasure! King Guto tried to fight him off, but Arimaspi managed to get away with the idol! 
     
    Arimaspi  
    Grampa Gruff  They say when our treasure fell into the Abysmal Abyss, our pride went with it. King Guto was the last king of Griffonstone, and we all lived miserably ever after. The end! 
    Pinkie Pie  That was the saddest story ever! 
    Grampa Gruff Aw, well... Tough tailfeathers! No refunds! 
    Pinkie Pie No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad? 
     
    Gilda It's not sad! Do we look sad to you? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone! 
    Gilda Ha-ha. Here we go â€“ typical pony hero complex. None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't care about anything, and that's the way we like it! 
    Pinkie Pie I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem! 
    Gilda The only problem Griffonstone has is you! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I don't care what she says. We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville! Come on! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice? 
    Rainbow Dash What, taking a bunch of pictures? 
    Pinkie Pie She mentioned finding answers at the library. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas. 

     
    Rainbow Dash I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss. 
    Storekeeper And I'll need some bits. 

    Pinkie Pie Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers! 
    Gilda Word on what street? 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town. 
    Gilda The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Aw, King Grover, you old charmer! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  I know what Griffonstone needs! 
    Gilda Fewer ponies? 
    Pinkie Pie A song! I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin!  
    Gilda Can't sing here! 
    Pinkie Pie But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing? 
    Gilda Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem â€“ lack of uplifting musical numbers. 
    Pinkie Pie Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store? 
     
    Pinkie Pie No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery? 
    Gilda Ugh. 
    Pinkie Pie No singing, no party store, no bakery?! What is this place?! 
    Gilda You're welcome to leave  at any time! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones! 
    Gilda Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty. 
    Pinkie Pie I'll buy one!  
    Gilda Bits first! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Gilda Well? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Gilda What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe. 
    Pinkie Pie  Ow! I think I broke a tooth! 
    Gilda Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town. 
    Pinkie Pie  I can help you with that! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet? 
    Storekeeper Can you give me more bits? 
    Rainbow Dash  Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss? 
    Storekeeper How deep are your pockets? 
    Rainbow Dash Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits? 
    Storekeeper Gimme some bits and I'll answer. 
    Rainbow Dash No wonder Gilda's such a delight. 

    Pinkie Pie  Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient. 
    Gilda Don't tell me. "Friendship"? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold! 
    Greta  
     
     
    Gilda Greta! 
    Pinkie Pie Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great! 
    Gilda What are you talking about? 
    Pinkie Pie You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down. 
    Gilda What, her? Greta's just some griffon I know. We don't have friends here!  I did have a friend once, but you saw how that turned out. 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash! 
    Gilda See ya. 

     
    Rainbow Dash  You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there. 

    Rainbow Dash Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Whoooa! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope! 
    Storekeeper You got bits? 
    Rainbow Dash Wait! Heeeeeelp...!  

     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie  There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem â€“ scones! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie, you get back here! 
    Pinkie Pie  Yeah? 
    Rainbow Dash  Can you throw down a rope or something? 
    Pinkie Pie  Lemme look! 
     
    Pinkie Pie One rope coming up! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie We need help. Don't go anywhere! 
    Rainbow Dash  Where does she think I'm gonna go? 
     
    Rainbow Dash  I hope I don't go anywhere! 

     
    Gilda  
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her! 
    Gilda Not my problem. 
    Pinkie Pie Of course it's your problem! She's your friend! 
    Gilda Used to be. 
    Pinkie Pie Can't you remember when she was? 
    Gilda Yeah. Of course. 

    Young Hoops Doesn't that griffon know she's supposed to fly at the Junior Speedsters Flight Camp? 
    Young Rainbow Dash Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...? 
    Young Gilda Uh... G-G-G-G-Gilda. 
    Young Rainbow Dash You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome! 
    Young Gilda  You too, Rainbow Dash! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done! 
     
    Young Gilda Junior Speedsters are our lives, 
    Young Rainbow Dash Skybound soars and daring dives, 
    Young Gilda and Young Rainbow Dash Junior Speedsters, it's our quest to someday be the very best! 

    Gilda Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend. 
    Pinkie Pie Duly noted.  Except it does! 

     
     
    Gilda Hang on, loser! I'm coming! 
    Rainbow Dash What took you so long, doofus?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie Gotcha! 
    Gilda, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
     
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Gilda Hold on, you two!  
     
    Gilda The Idol of Boreas!  
    Rainbow Dash I'm slipping! 
    Gilda  
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Gilda  
     
     
    Rainbow Dash The idol! 
    Gilda You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hugging later, climbing now! 

    Gilda I'm really sorry about how I treated you two. 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks, Gilda. 
    Pinkie Pie Apology accepted. 
    Rainbow Dash And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem. 
    Pinkie Pie That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better! 
    Gilda Nothing's better than gold to a griffon. 
    Pinkie Pie That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other. 
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy. 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend! 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know. 
    Gilda Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, Pinkie. I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Well, we'd better be heading home. 
    Gilda What? Y-Y-You want me to spread friendship here by myself?! How am I supposed to do that?! I haven't even made one single friend yet! 
    Rainbow Dash No, you haven't. You've made two. 
    Pinkie Pie  Hugging! Hugging now! 
    Gilda But you'll come back and visit, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Just try and stop us! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  See ya later, you old charmer. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, Pinkie? Who are you talking to? 
    Pinkie Pie Nopony! Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe! 

    Gummy  

     

Slice of Life

     
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I'll never understand the ponies in this town! Everywhere I went, they were all gussied up and lookin' at me funny! Kept asking if I was "nervous"! 
    Matilda Did they forget the wedding is tomorrow? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Oh, maybe they're just as excited for us to be married as I am. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda  
    Matilda Well, they're going to feel awfully silly when they realize they've got the wrong date.  The invitations are wrong! This says the wedding is today! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey But I got such a good deal on them... 
    Matilda Everypony in town got these! The princesses have even RSVP'd! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I told you we should have eloped! 
    Matilda Oh, dear. The caterer, the flowers, the musicians! We've got to move it all to today! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey What?! 
     
    Matilda Where's my wedding planner?! 

    Cranky Doodle Donkey You told me you could do it for half what the others charged, and then you sent the invitations to everypony in town with the wrong date!  
    Derpy Muffin? 

     

    Derpy I really messed up on those invitations! I feel just awful, Doc! 
    Savoir Fare Hmph! Perhaps that explains why I never got mine! 
    Derpy I told Cranky I could get 'em printed for cheap, but that meant hiring somepony with no experience using a printing press. 

     
     

    Derpy Oh, I wish there was a way I could go back in time and fix all this. 
    Dr. Hooves  

    Dr. Hooves Going back in time is old thinking, my friend. I was working off a cutting-edge theory of making time come forward to you. 
     
    Dr. Hooves My life's work, decades â€“ centuries, really â€“ of research and experimentation, and I nearly had it cracked! Turns out there's a magic spell for it. Who knew? 
     
     
    Dr. Hooves But there are so many things that magic can't explain, where science and mathematics are the real magic! 
    Derpy Like these? They're pretty. 
    Dr. Hooves Ah, yes, my flameless fireworks. I never could quite figure out how to get them to ignite. 
    Derpy How did you learn to make all this stuff anyway? 
    Dr. Hooves I've been studying science my whole life. Ever since a particularly traumatic experience as a foal, I've been looking for ways to make sense of the world around me. Science provides explanations of things we never thought possible! Now, why did we come here again? 
    Derpy Yeah. Oh! Because I accidentally sent out invitations for Cranky and Matilda's wedding with today's date instead of tomorrow's! 
    Dr. Hooves Great whickering stallions! I completely forgot! And I still need to get my suit tailored! 

    Dr. Hooves Rarity?  
     
    Dr. Hooves  Have you seen Rarity? She's got to alter the sleeves on my suit, and she's got to do it now! Oh, ha-ha, thank goodness. Lead on, my friend. 

     
    Dr. Hooves Er, why have you brought me here? Rarity would never set hoof inâ€” 
     
    Dr. Hooves Great whickering stallions, they've got style! Gentlecolts! I'm facing certain calamity, and I couldn't help noticing your remarkable fashion sense. Could I have the name of your incredible tailor? 
    Jeff Letrotski Oh, yeah, man. His name is me. 
    Dr. Hooves "Me". What an unfortunate name. 
    Jeff Letrotski No, man, like, I manufacture all of my own garments. We all do, man. 
    Dr. Hooves Then you've got to help me! I need this suit tailored! It's an emergency! 
    Jeff Letrotski  Sorry, man, we're just about to start the finals. 
    Dr. Hooves What's this word you keep using â€“ "man"? 
    Jeff Letrotski I dunno, man, but guess what? Our fourth didn't show, so if you roll with us, we'll alter your suit for you. 
     
    Dr. Hooves I'm sorry, gentlecolts, but I will not bowl. The splits, the spares! There are simply too many variables! 
    Jeff Letrotski Variables? What are you talking about, man? Just throw the ball straight! 
    Dr. Hooves Hold on. Straight? 
     
     
    Dr. Hooves Very well. I'll try your "straight" technique. It just might be crazy enough to work. 

    Octavia Melody Do we know what they're on about? 
    Apple Bloom The way they're huddled up like that, I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack. 
    Octavia Melody A monster attack?! Blast! I'm performing at the ceremony this afternoon, and I still haven't sorted out what to play. How am I meant to practice with a monster invading Ponyville? 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so. 
    Octavia Melody  I hope so. 
    Matilda Where's Pinkie Pie?! I need my wedding planner! 
     
     
    Matilda Oh, no! On my wedding day?! Somepony's gotta help me! You! 
    Amethyst Star Me? 
    Matilda I need to move an entire wedding from tomorrow to today! 
    Amethyst Star But nopony's asked me to organize anything since Twilight came to town. 
    Matilda So you'll do it? 
    Amethyst Star I used to be the best organizer in all of Ponyville. You bet I'llâ€” 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
     
    Matilda Come on! We better get to the salon before that monster flattens it! 
     

     
    Derpy What am I gonna do?  Matilda! I feel so bad about the invitations! Is there anything I can doâ€” 
    Matilda FLOWERS! 

    Lily Valley You want Matilda's arrangements... today?! 
     
    Daisy This is awful! 
    Rose The horror, the horror! 
    Derpy So there's no way you can do it? 
    Lily Valley We don't even have Matilda's flowers in yet, much less arranged!  This is a disaster! 
    Derpy Okay. Thanks anyway. 
     
    Lily Valley  Look, girls! A broken stem on one of the zinnias! 
    Daisy Whaaat?! 
     
    Rose Oh, the horror, the horror! 

    Sweetie Drops I have to admit, when Matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous. 
    Lyra Heartstrings With you by my side, I knew we'd get it done in time. 
    Sweetie Drops There is nothing like a best friend, is there? 
    Lyra Heartstrings Anything's possible when you know somepony as well as we know each other! 
     
    Sweetie Drops What was that? 
    Lyra Heartstrings There's some monster attacking Ponyville or something. 
    Sweetie Drops What is it this time? A creature from the Everfree Forest? 
    Lyra Heartstrings Uh, I think it's some sort of bugbear.  
    Sweetie Drops Did you say bugbear? It found me! 
    Lyra Heartstrings What are you talking about, Bon Bon? 
    Sweetie Drops My name isn't Bon Bon. It's "Special Agent Sweetie Drops". I work for a super-secret anti-monster agency in Canterlot, or at least I did until the bugbear went missing from Tartarus a few years back. 
    Lyra Heartstrings What are you talking about? 
    Sweetie Drops When it escaped, we had to shutter the whole agency. Every last shred of evidence of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability. 
    Lyra Heartstrings ...What? 
    Sweetie Drops It was me who captured the bugbear. I had to go deep cover here in Ponyville and assume the name Bon Bon. I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now it has. 
    Lyra Heartstrings Are you saying our whole friendship was based on a lie?! 
    Sweetie Drops I'm sorry, Lyra! I couldn't tell you for your own protection! 
    Lyra Heartstrings B-b-but the lunches! The-the long talks! The benches we sat on!  None of that was real?! 
    Sweetie Drops It was all real. You're my very best friend. 
     
     
     
    Sweetie Drops I've got to go find a crowd to blend into before I put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding. 
    Lyra Heartstrings Fine! But we're going to talk about this later! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I need my ring today, no matter the cost! ...As long as it doesn't cost any extra. 

    Jeff Letrotski Seven/ten split, man. Harshest of the harsh. But if you pick this up, we win the whole shebang! 
    Dr. Hooves  
     
    Derpy Doc! I've finally figured out how I can help! Your flameless fireworks look just like flowers! I'll use them for the wedding! 
    Dr. Hooves Great whickering stallions! Wait! 
     
    Walter  
    Dr. Hooves Wait! The flameless fireworks are extremely volatile! Without knowing what the trigger is, they could go off at any moment! My word, is that a bugbear? 
     
    Matilda Oh, there are so many things I'm forgetting! I hope Cranky remembers to tell the musicians! Oh! Oh! I'll never get my mane done in time! 
    Lotus Blossom You must relax, my dear! We can handle anything! We once did a pony's hair during the ceremony! 
    Steven Magnet Oh, it's true, it's true! They really are the best! Matilda, I've just got to say, I already feel like we're family. 
    Matilda You do? 
    Steven Magnet Of course! I'm Steven Magnet, Cranky's best beast! 
    Matilda You're Steven Magnet? 
    Steven Magnet Well, what'd you expect, a bugbear? I've known Cranky forev-er! Surely he must have told you about the time he saved me from Flash Freeze Lake? 
    Matilda ...You're Steven Magnet. 
    Steven Magnet Oh, I know, I know! Typical Cranky, to leave out minor details, like the fact that I'm, y'know, a sea monster, right?  I just love that old burro! 
    Matilda I'm sorry, Steven. I guess I assumed you were a pony. And I had no idea you had such adventures together. 
    Steven Magnet Oh, honey, you don't know the half of it! But let me tell you something. In all that we've been through together, the only thing he ever cared about was finding you. 
    Matilda Really? 
    Steven Magnet Well, that and a baldness cure.  
    Matilda He is the sweetest thing, isn't he? All the stress I've put myself through. All the stress I've put him through. The only thing that matters is that we're together. The wedding isn't the important thing â€“ the marriage is. 
    Steven Magnet  Honey, the wedding is everything. 
    Matilda  

    Octavia Melody  
     
    Octavia Melody Thanks, but I'm not sure that's appropriate for a wedding, is it?  
     
    Octavia Melody  That's more like it! 
     
     
     
    Octavia Melody Stop! I'm going to be late for the wedding! 
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Gummy  
     
    Octavia Melody Something like that might work. 

    Princess Celestia  What do you mean you left it on the counter?! 
    Princess Luna  I thought you were bringing it! 
    Princess Celestia  Well, this is just wonderful! 
     
    Princess Luna  I handled the gift for Cadance and Shining Armor! You were supposed to do this one, remember? 
    Princess Celestia  Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed! 
    Shining Armor  
    Princess Cadance  It's alright. He always cries at weddings. 
    Shining Armor  
    Princess Cadance ...Usually it's not until the wedding starts. 
    Derpy These flameless fireworks look even better than flowers!  
    Sweetie Drops Attention, everypony! Our friends have done it! They've defeated the bugbear! 
     
    Sweetie Drops  Hey. 
    Lyra Heartstrings Hello. 
    Sweetie Drops So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation about my  to anypony, did you? 
    Lyra Heartstrings No. I did not. And you're not the only one with a secret, y'know. You know those expensive imported oats you were saving for a special occasion? I cooked them up and ate them! All of them!  It's sort of thrilling to reveal your deepest, darkest secrets! 
    Sweetie Drops  That's what best friends are for. 
    Princess Celestia  Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine. 
    Princess Luna  Fine. 
     
    Dr. Hooves There you are! My suit has vanished and this was the only thing left in my closet! How do I look? 
    Derpy Like a million bits! 
    Dr. Hooves Great whickering stallions, look at the time! We'd better get inside. Allons-y! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey I can't believe I lost my hair! I look ridiculous. The love of my life deserves better than this! 
    Steven Magnet Have no fear, Cranky, my dear. It's Steven Magnet's mustache to the rescue! 
     
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Aw, thanks, buddy. 
    Steven Magnet Oh, no problem. Now you get in there and marry that donkey! 
    Mayor Mare Well, is everypony here? 
     
    Derpy All set, Mayor! 
    Mayor Mare Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in mare-trimony. As I look around this room, I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cranky must be. 
     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
    Mayor Mare But I also see so many ponies from all trots of life, brought together by love. Cranky searched all across this great land of ours to find Matilda, and no matter what obstacles kept them apart, love would finally bring them together, just as it has brought all of us together now. It's remarkable to me how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies! It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story. And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's everypony â€“ those who play big parts and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room and many more who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are. 
    Steven Magnet  
    Bulk Biceps  
    Mayor Mare And so, in front of all these loved ones... Cranky, do you take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded wife? 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey You bet I do! 
    Mayor Mare And do you, Matilda, take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband? 
    Matilda  I do! 
    Mayor Mare Then I'm proud to say, I now pronounce you jack and jenny! 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda  
     
     
    Dr. Hooves  Of course! They need love to ignite! How could I have missed it?! 

    Twilight Sparkle You know something, girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all! 
    Rainbow Dash Ow! That's where the bugbear bit me! 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry! 

     

Princess Spike

     
     
    Princess Luna Welcome to the Grand Equestria Pony Summit! 
     
    Princess Celestia You delegates have traveled far and wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria. At tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home cities. 
     
    Spike  
    Princess Celestia Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit Princess Twilight Sparkle! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Thank you, everypony. With delegates from over fifty cities attending three days of conferences, receptions, and meetings, this is the largest Grand Equestria Pony Summit yet. And let me tell you, putting it all together has led to more than one sleepless night. We're so excited to have you here and to learn more about life all across this great land of ours. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And now my faithful assistant Spike would like to say a few words. 
    Spike Um, hello, everypony! I'm here to help any way I can. So if there's anything I can do for any of youâ€” 
    Neigh Sayer We love you, Princess Twilight! 
    Delegate 2 We love all the princesses! 
     
    Spike  I guess everypony loves a princess. Hmph. 

     

     
     
    Spike Ugh! 
    Princess Cadance Spike! 
     
    Princess Cadance Spike? 
    Spike  A little help? 
    Princess Cadance Spike, we need you! 
    Spike Of course! What can I do? 
     
    Spike Whoa, what happened to you? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Princess Cadance She's been awake three straight days preparing for the summit. We need to make sure she gets some rest today. She'll never be able to attend the welcome reception in this condition. Can I count on you to see to it that she isn't disturbed? 
    Spike I promise! I won't let you down! 

    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     
    Spike Perfect. 
     
    Spike Not on my watch. 
     
    Spike Uh, excuse me? Can you keep it down a little? Oh, no! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike I'll give you birdseed! Worms! Anything! Just please stop singing before you wake the princess! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Huh. I can't believe that worked. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Hyah! 
    Polo ponies  
    Spike  Uh, hi fellas. Sorry to break up your game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh... maybe you could move your game somewhere else? 
     
    Spike Uh, the princess thanks you for your understanding! Excuse me. Do you have to do this right now?  
    Horticultural Pegasus Uh, these are too top-heavy. Wouldn't take much to bring these beauties down. 
     
    Spike  Can't you just wait a few hours? 
    Horticultural Pegasus Sorry, it's a public hazard. I got my orders. 
    Spike Well, I've got my orders too from Princess Twi... Twi... Twilight...!  
    Horticultural Pegasus Princess Twilight?  Why didn't you say so? Gee, I reckon they'll keep a few more hours. 
    Spike Huh. Good thing I've got the princesses on my side. 
     
    Spike  â€”stop right now! Oops. 
    Public Works Pony  Lemme guess, the noise? Sorry, but we can't have a broken water main! 
    Spike Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?! 
    Public Works Pony  Hey, pal, I'm just tryin' to make sure everything runs smooth for the summit! 
    Spike But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here. So if you don't mind, I'dâ€” 
    Public Works Pony  But if something happens, it ain't my fault! 
     

    Spike Hmph! Princess Twilight will be rested, Princess Cadance will be proud, and Princess Spike deserves a little reward. Hah! Princess Spike.  
    "Joe Pescolt" and "March Gustysnows"  
    "Joe Pescolt" ...Oh, lemme tell you somethin', alright? I worked forever on this speech, and I know I have moreâ€” 
    Spike Uh, hi. Can I help you? 
    "March Gustysnows" My friend here, the distinguished pony from up Manehattan, and I are in a bit of a pickle, and we need the Princess Twilight to resolve it. 
    Spike Uh, can you talk a little quieter? And maybe come back later? 
    "March Gustysnows" Oh, sure now, gosh, I wish we could but, uh, we're both supposed to give speeches about our local economies in five minutes, and we've been booked in the same hall! 
    "Joe Pescolt" I had the room first. And let's be honest, my speech is more important. 
    "March Gustysnows" Point of order there, sir, but I think you'll find that my speech is the more important one, don't'cha know? 
    "Joe Pescolt" Look, youse is gonna have a lot of unhappy delegates on your hooves unless we get a ruling from Princess Twilight right now! 
    Spike  Lemme see what I can do. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Huh? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Does something need scheduling? 
    Spike Oh, uh, yeah. Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall. What do I do? 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, no problem. Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle, hm? 
    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Spike Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight! Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?! 

     
    "Joe Pescolt" Well? What did she say? She picked me, right? 
    "March Gustysnows" Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be too hasty there, good sir. I got a feeling she went with me. 
    "Joe Pescolt" He-hey, if she didn't pick me, it ain't hard to see that as an insult to all of Manehattan! You know what I'm sayin'? 
    "March Gustysnows" And it'd sure be a shame to see something like a scheduling issue create a nasty old rift between Whinnyapolis and Ponyville. 
    "Joe Pescolt" So? What did the Princess say? 
    "March Gustysnows" Come on, now! Spit it out! 
    Spike Um, she said that... Well, she said that she... she wants you to... share it? 
     
    "Joe Pescolt" If that's what the princess wants, what are ya gonna do? 
    "March Gustysnows" The princess is always right! 

    "Joe Pescolt" 
    Listen. No hard feelings. 
    This is not about you or me, alright? 
    I mean, this is... 

    

    "March Gustysnows" 
    Now there ya go, 
    we got a solution! 
    I have no hard feelings... 

    Spike  

    Annoyed Delegate Combining those two talks was a disaster! The hall was overcrowded and the speakers just shouted over each other! 
    Spike Huh? B-butâ€” 
    Annoyed Delegate Why would the princess have made such a decision?! 
     
    Spike Uh, by order of Princess Twilight, be quiet!  
    Fluffy Clouds I was really looking forward to the "Don't Spend All Your Bits" Speech, but when I went into the hall,  a pony had taken my seat. A pony who used to be my friend! 
    Spike Your friend took your seat? Hah, big deal! Why don't you justâ€” 
    Fluffy Clouds No offense, but I don't need some random dragon's opinion. I-I want to hear what Princess Twilight thinks. 
    Spike  Fine. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Spike Uh... 
     
    Spike The princess says no friendship should end over a seat. You should forgive your friend! 
    Fluffy Clouds  Of course! Oh, the princess is so wise! 
     
    Spike I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight.  Alright! Who's next? 
     
    Spike So, how can Princess Twilight be of service? 
    Fancy Pants Well, as host city, the Canterlot delegation feels it's only right that we should get passes to every meeting and party, yes? 
    Spike Well, that doesn't seem fairâ€”I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair. 
    Fancy Pants Ehhh... yes, yes, very well. It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm? 
    Spike This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up! Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help? 
     
     
    Spike If I can check a few of these meetings off Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think about anything but the reception. 

     
    Spike Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight? 
    "Frazzle Rock"  Uh, yuppers. She wanted me to prep her on all the different gemstones in the Citizens of Equestria statue before the reception tonight. 
    Spike Okay, go ahead. 
    "Frazzle Rock"  Um, well, I'd rather, um, tell the princess directly. 
    Spike Well, if it helps, you can call me "Princess Spike". No-no-no, it's alright. The princess asked me to take care of a few things for her. That's why I came to find you. 
    "Frazzle Rock"  Um, if you say so. 
    Spike The princess says so! 
    "Frazzle Rock"  Uh, okay. Let's start with topaz... 

    Public Works Pony  
    Spike I'm here for your two o'clock! 
    Public Works Pony You?! But I'm supposed to be briefing Princess Twilight on the progress with the water main! 
    Spike I speak for the Princess. 
    Public Works Pony Uh, well, uh, can I start fixing it again? I'm getting a little worried, to be honest. 
     
    Spike Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours. Sorry. 
    Princess Cadance Hey, Spike. What's going on? 
    Spike Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down! 
    Princess Cadance What do you mean? 
    Spike Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up. 
    Princess Cadance Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit. 
    Spike Nah, don't worry. I got it covered. I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her! 
    Princess Cadance Oh, okay. Well, thank you for keeping Twilight's stress level down. As long as that's the real reason you're doing it. 
    Spike Well, why else would I be doing it? 
    Princess Cadance You're not enjoying speaking for Twilight a little bit? 
    Spike Enjoying it?  

    Spike  By order of the princess. 
     

    Spike By order of the princess!  

    Spike  By order of the princess...! 

    Spike  
    Princess Cadance It sure is, but it's also hard work, isn't it? 
    Spike Eh, it's not so bad. 
    Princess Cadance Spike, I'm concerned you might be abusing your relationship with Twilight. 
    Spike What are you talking about? I'm a great princessâ€”I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master! 
     
    Spike  Okay. So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions. But it's not like anything bad happened. 
     
     
     
    Princess Cadance and Spike  
    Spike This is unexpected! 
    Princess Cadance I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water! 
     
     
     
     
    Spike At least the statue's okay.  
     
    Spike Oh, bless me... 

     
    Fancy Pants Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?! 
    Spike Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, andâ€” 
    Fancy Pants How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?! 
    Public Works Pony Hey, don't look at me! Princess Twilight said to stop working on it! 
    Fancy Pants Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation! 
    Horticultural Pegasus But the princess told me to stop, bub! 
    Fancy Pants Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented! 
     
    Spike Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened! 
    Fancy Pants What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions! 
    "March Gustysnows" I'm about to blow my stack on Princess Twilight, I'll tell you that for nothin'! 
    "Joe Pescolt" Yeah, me too! 
    Fancy Pants I'll not let Princess Twilight give Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's go give her a piece of our minds! 
     
    Spike Please! You've got it all wrong! 

     
    Spike  wait! 
    Fancy Pants What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction! 
    Spike It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we? 
    "Joe Pescolt" Wake her?! What?! You're tellin' me that she's asleep?! 
     
     
     
    Spike  
    Fancy Pants  Princess, we must speak at once! 
    Spike She is SLEEPING! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  I'm glad you're here, Spike. We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed? 
    Spike Uh, you seem well-rested. 
    Twilight Sparkle I haven't slept like that since I was a filly! 
    Spike You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing right. And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me. Maybe I did do a good job today! 
     
     
    Spike  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Fancy Pants, what's wrong? 
    Fancy Pants Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here! 
    Twilight Sparkle Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme! 
    Fancy Pants The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on, Spike? 
    Spike Um... you needed to sleep. And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed. And there was this bird, and, well... long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf. 

    Twilight Sparkle A few decisions?! 
    Spike Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions! Honest! Until I... didn't anymore. I'm sorry, Twilight. I guess I got a little carried away. It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters. I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it. 
    Spike How do I do that? 
    Princess Cadance You could start with them. 
    Spike  Uh, hi there, everypony. So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology. It's funny. Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself. You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special. But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good. 
     
    Fancy Pants The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport. 
    "March Gustysnows" And ours goes here, don't'cha know? 
     
    Spike Does this mean you forgive me? 
    "Joe Pescolt" Sure! You know, the whole idea of the statue is that when each of us plays our own small part, it adds up to somethin' great. 
    Fancy Pants Quite. Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria! 
    Princess Cadance I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small! 
     
    Spike  

     

Party Pooped

    Twilight Sparkle You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine! 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ohhhh... 
    Fluttershy They're probably just as nervous as you are. 
    Applejack You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I'm calm! I'm calm... 
    Spike  
     
    Prince Rutherford Ponies! Greetings, ponies! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria. 
    Prince Rutherford Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks.  Friends for a thousand moons! 
    Twilight Sparkle You must be hungry after a long journey. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods. 
    Prince Rutherford If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Prince Rutherford  This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
     
    Pinkie Pie Is it okay to be nervous now? 

     

     
    Applejack Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' "howdy." 
    Rarity They're different, that's all. Very... different. 
    Rainbow Dash I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy. 
    Twilight Sparkle All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended? 
    Rainbow Dash Um... I-I had a thing... 
    Pinkie Pie I did, I did! Did you know they live so far north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time? Yaks have yak fur to keep them warm.  
    Applejack Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie I know! Yaks are so cool! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan. 
    Pinkie Pie No problem! 
    Twilight Sparkle Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends! 
    Main cast sans Twilight  

    Applejack We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit. 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan. 
    Prince Rutherford Hmm... This perfect. 
    Pinkie Pie You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight! 
    Applejack  That wasn't so hard. 
    Prince Rutherford Wait! This not yak hay! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours. 
    Prince Rutherford Not perfect! Yaks destroy! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Applejack Pinkie Pie, what do we do?! 

    Pinkie Pie And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style! 
     
    Prince Rutherford Animals cute. 
    Fluttershy Oh. Thank goodness. 
     
    Prince Rutherford Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! Yaks smash! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
     
    Pinkie Pie Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think. 

    Rarity Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find themâ€” 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Rarity ...delicious. 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Prince Rutherford This no taste like yak fabric! Yaks destroy! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Pinkie Pie Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow. 

     
    Pinkie Pie Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down! 
    Prince Rutherford Hold your frown, face! 
    Pinkie Pie Hit it, Rainbow Dash! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from. 
    Prince Rutherford  This not yak snow! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Pinkie Pie Seriously?! ...Seriously? 

    Applejack Y'know... it's goin' okay. 
    Rarity Satisfactory, I'd say. 
    Rainbow Dash It could be better. 
    Fluttershy  It's not very good. 
    Pinkie Pie It's a disaster! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take! 
    Pinkie Pie I definitely will! I think. Maybe...? 
    Applejack You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria. 
    Rainbow Dash You'll show 'em a good time! 
    Fluttershy You can do it! 
    Rarity We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope! 
    Rainbow Dash Why are your eyes darting around like that? 
    Pinkie Pie It's what I do when I'm not nervous!  
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without youâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Me either! Gotta go! 
     

    Pinkie Pie  Gummy, what am I gonna do? I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! Fluttershy! Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?! 
    Gummy  
    Pinkie Pie  

    Twilight Sparkle And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake. 
    Prince Rutherford Vanilla extract balance very tricky. 
    Yaks Uh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?! 

    Twilight Sparkle  Did you find her? 
    Fluttershy Angel and I searched the forest, but... 
    Rainbow Dash Aerial recon turned up nothing either. 
    Applejack I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so... not a complete loss. 
    Rarity She's simply vanished! 
    Twilight Sparkle But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?! 
     
    Gummy  
    Twilight Sparkle  No reason to freak out! 
    Fluttershy Don't worry, Twilight. 
    Applejack When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back. 
    Rainbow Dash Piece o' cake. 
    Twilight Sparkle The cake! 

    Mrs. Cake One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan.  I hope. 
     
    Prince Rutherford  Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract! 
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Twilight Sparkle We've never needed a party so badly. 

    Conductor Next stop, Crystal Empire! 
    Pinkie Pie And so my quest begins. I know what you're thinking. "Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?" Because I'm the party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I mean? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow.  Nope. Sand. Definitely sand. 
    Conductor Dodge City. End of the line, I'm afraid. All trains had to stop. Sheep decided to sit on the tracks. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Curse you, sheep! Thanks for you help, conductor. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Cherry Jubilee! 
    Cherry Jubilee Pinkie Pie?! I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now. 
    Pinkie Pie How are you? You look amazing! I need help. 
    Cherry Jubilee I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda. What can I do ya for? 
    Pinkie Pie Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there? 
    Cherry Jubilee Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this right here's your lucky day! I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire myself for a delivery. I ought to warn you though â€“ me and the boys are powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries. Hey there! Wake up! 
    Pinkie Pie Counting cherries? How many? 
    Cherry Jubilee Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four. Yee-haw! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 

    Pinkie Pie And so my quest resumes. As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen. Know what I mean? 
    Cherry Jubilee  
    Pinkie Pie Cherry? Ravine. Ravine! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Wake up! Wake up!  Stooooop! 
     
     
    Cherry Jubilee Huh?!  Whoa. I was dreamin' about a ravine. Ravine! 
    Pinkie Pie That's what I said. 
     

     
    Prince Rutherford and Yaks  
    Prince Rutherford Music beautiful. Much soul. 
    Twilight Sparkle Phew! 
    Spike  When Twilight told me to stallâ€” I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I couldâ€” 
     
    Yaks Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
    Prince Rutherford Piano play itself?! Music a lie!  
     
    Prince Rutherford We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle No! Just a little longer! 
    Prince Rutherford No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare war! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  

    Twilight Sparkle No Pinkie Pie? What's this?! 
    Applejack Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party. 
    Rainbow Dash It's sort of panic-themed. 
    Twilight Sparkle The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war. 

     
    Pinkie Pie There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... Pow! We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what I mean? 
    Princess Cadance This is it. The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this? 
    Pinkie Pie I do. 
    Princess Cadance Good luck, Pinkie Pie. 

    Twilight Sparkle How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her. 
    Fluttershy I'm sure she's trying her best. 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know you're right, but... I wish she was here. I put too much pressure on her. I let everypony down. And Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made new friends. I've made new enemies.  
     
    Main cast sans Pinkie  

     
     
    Pinkie Pie Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it? 
    Monster  
    Pinkie Pie Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're sayingâ€” 
    Monster  
    Pinkie Pie  There it is! Yakyakistan! 
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Noooooooooo...!  

    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. Is everypony alright? 
    Fluttershy I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed. 
    Rainbow Dash I think I can see a little bit. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Gah! Nope. 
     
    Main cast sans Pinkie Ooooh... 
    Applejack Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town! 
    Fluttershy With exactly what kind of parties we like. 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?! 
    Fluttershy  "Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..." 
    Twilight Sparkle That's right! 
    Fluttershy "But she's afraid of quesadillas." 
    Twilight Sparkle No, I'm not! They're just so...  cheesy. 

    Pinkie Pie  ...oooooooo! No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hmm? 
    Main cast sans Pinkie  
    Applejack Looky here. It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. And their five-hundredth? 
    Twilight Sparkle I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties. 
    Rainbow Dash She may be more organized than you, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's not get carried away. 
    Rarity I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work. 
    Pinkie Pie  Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you! 
    Twilight Sparkle You're back! 
    Pinkie Pie I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a mistake.  I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But I'm still just a big failure. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure. 
    Fluttershy What matters is how hard you tried. 
    Rainbow Dash Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party? 
    Pinkie Pie You know... the trip was really hard. But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is!  I just got the best party idea ever! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's too late. The yaks left on the last train. 
    Pinkie Pie Um, no, they didn't.  Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there! 
     
    Fluttershy So, um, do we walk back up the slide or... or what? 

    Prince Rutherford Yaks stuck here?! Why trains not work?!  
    Pinkie Pie I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time! 
    Yaks Ooh. 

     
    Prince Rutherford  
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you. 
    Pinkie Pie What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home. We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too. 
    Prince Rutherford Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Prince Rutherford Ponies and yaks... friends? 
    Pinkie Pie For a thousand moons? 
    Prince Rutherford For a thousand moons! 
    Mane Six, Princess Celestia, and Yaks  
    Princess Celestia I am very impressed, princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship. 
    Princess Celestia And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends. 
    Prince Rutherford Pink pony, you understand yaks now. 
    Pinkie Pie Aww, come here, you! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay! 

     

Amending Fences

     
    Spike  You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship? The dishes. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks for taking care of that, Spike. After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book. 
    Spike It's kinda funny, isn't it? All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship? 
    Twilight Sparkle What's funny about that? 
    Spike You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend. 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you talking about? I had good friends in Canterlot. 
    Spike Come on, Twilight. Look at the wall. D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville? And look at you now â€“ the Princess of Friendship. 
    Twilight Sparkle  This is a disaster! All my old friends! I can't remember any of their names right now! But do you really think that they think I'm a bad friend?! 
    Spike Well, I only meant that you've come so far. You're a great friend now andâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I feel terrible! I've gotta make it up to them! Pack a bag, Spike! We're going to Canterlot! And make a list of my friends' names. 
    Spike Aw. Me and my big mouth. 

     

    Spike Come on, Twilight. You're getting worked up about nothin'. 
    Twilight Sparkle The only logical place to start is at the beginning. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. It's exactly how we left it!  Look! It's Predictions and Prophecies! And it's still open to the Elements of Harmony! 
    Spike And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer! Huh. Guess she won't be needing that. Hey, look! The rest of it's still here! 
    Twilight Sparkle How could I have let this happen? 
    Spike Come on, Twilight. Princess Celestia gave you an assignment. Nopony could blame you for that. 
    Twilight Sparkle But look at the way I left this place. It's a total mess! Just like how I left my friendships. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I've gotta make it up toooo... uh... 
    Spike Oh! Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah. Them. 

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Come on! We've got work to do! 
    Spike  Have you been awake all night? 
    Twilight Sparkle I did a little research, and I think I know where we can find Minuette! That is one of my friends, right? 

     
    Spike Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, Spike, I'm glad you opened your big mouth. These ponies have probably been suffering ever since I left. Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Minuette? 
    Minuette Twilight Sparkle!  But they've never believed me! 
     
    Minuette Wait-wait-wait! Really fluff 'em up, huh?  
     
     
    Minuette So what are you doing here? I mean, I know you're here all the time, but you never come to see me. Hey! I just had the greatest idea! You wanna go see Lemon Hearts and Twinkleshine? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! My old friends! 
    Minuette It'll be great!  
    Twilight Sparkle This is perfect! I can apologize to all three of them at once! 
    Spike Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette. 

    Twilight Sparkle, Twinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts  
    Minuette She did! Twinkleshine literally spit out her oats when she heard you were the Princess of Friendship! 
    Twinkleshine We saw you at the coronation. That was some shindig! 
    Twilight Sparkle You did? 
    Twinkleshine Sure! We see you all the time! 
    Minuette You remember our old friend, Lyra, right?  We've thought about asking you to join us from time to time, but we just sorta figured you'd moved on. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. 
     
    Lemon Hearts  So what brings you by anyway? All those times you've come back to Canterlot, you never had donuts with us before. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, uh, you see...  I came to apologize. 
    Minuette  For what? 
    Twilight Sparkle Before I left Canterlot, I didn't really appreciate my friends. And that's because I didn't know how important friendship was. But I've learned so much since I moved to Ponyville. I learned what it means to be a good friend and that I certainly wasn't one to the three of you. So for all the pain I caused you, I am truly sorry. 
    Twinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts  
    Minuette Oh, come on, Twilight! Sure, it might've stung a little bit when you ran off to Ponyville without saying goodbye, but it's not like we weren't used to that from you! 
    Twinkleshine Yeah, we didn't take it personally. 
    Lemon Hearts But it's really good to see you now. Hey! Anypony up for a blast from the past? 

    Twilight Sparkle  It's our old science lab! I have so many great memories of this place! 
    Minuette  Remember when Lemon Hearts got her head stuck in that beaker? 
    Twinkleshine and Minuette  
     
    Young Twilight Sparkle But according to this book, you're supposed to add the sodium chloride first. 
    Young Moon Dancer I read ahead, and to make a proper salt lick, you need to add the molasses first. 
    Young Twilight Sparkle Well, I read ahead too, Moon Dancer, and I'm sure it said sodium chloride first. 
    Young Moon Dancer  Oh. I've got the wrong book. That's so hilarious. 
    Twinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts  
    Twilight Sparkle Whatever happened to Moon Dancer? 
    Lemon Hearts Moon Dancer? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, you know, our other friend. 
    Twinkleshine Oh, right! Moon Dancer! I remember her! 
    Lemon Hearts I wonder what she's up to. 
    Minuette Yeah, I always liked her. We just sort of lost touch after you left. 
    Twinkleshine I think she went to live out by the stadium, didn't she? 
    Lemon Hearts Well, let's go see. 

    Minuette I think this is the place. Didn't used to look like this, though. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Moon Dancer? 
    Moon Dancer What do you want? I'm trying to study. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's us! Your old friends! 
    Moon Dancer Ugh! 
     
    Minuette  
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly how I used to be. 

    Spike  Come on, Twilight! We've been watching her for three days! Library, house, library, house. That's it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile. It's like she doesn't even exist. Was she always like this? 
    Minuette Well, she always was a little shy. But for a while there, she was really starting to come out of her shell. Remember when she threw that party? Oh, right. I think you might've been busy that day. 

    Twinkleshine There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on. 

    Minuette Thought she finally might be letting her guard down a little with that party. We invited her out a few times after that. But she was always too busy studying. So, eventually, we just stopped asking. 
    Twilight Sparkle I had no idea that party was so important to her. I've gotta find a way to make it up to her! 

     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, my gosh! Moon Dancer?! Is thatâ€” 
    Ponies Shh! 

    Twilight Sparkle Moon Dancer, can I talk to you for a minâ€” 
    Moon Dancer Shh! What is this? 
    Twilight Sparkle Eh, a bubble of silence. I haven't seen you in a while and I thought it might be nice to catch up. 
    Moon Dancer For what purpose? 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, 'cause we're friends. 
     
    Ponies Shhh! 

    Twilight Sparkle I'm really sorry to bother you. I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  I'm sorry I skipped your party. 
    Moon Dancer  
     
    Ponies  
    Moon Dancer  Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties! 
    Twilight Sparkle  You did once. And I was so caught up in my own studying that I didn't take your feelings into account. 
    Moon Dancer  Look, Twilight Twinkleâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle  Sparkle. 
    Moon Dancer  Whatever! I just need to be alone so I can study without some crazy pony trying to make friends, all right?! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Fine! 
    Moon Dancer  Wait. How did you get into my book like that? 

    Twilight Sparkle I've been studying a new studying technique. I can only do it for a few minutes, but you'd be amazed how much you can pick up when you're actually in a book! 
    Moon Dancer It's one of Hayscartes' methods. 
    Twilight Sparkle You know Hayscartes? 
    Moon Dancer Of course! He's a genius! 
    Twilight Sparkle I have a copy of his Treatise on Ponies, you know. 
    Moon Dancer  

    Moon Dancer What is this place? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is where I used to live. You mean, I never had you over? 
    Moon Dancer Wow! A first edition of Principles of Magic! Hey, didn't I give this to you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe? 
    Moon Dancer I did! Look, I even wrote something! "To my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics." I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Look, I didn't bring you over here for even more poignant reminders of what a bad friend I was. I brought you here to give you this. You can come here whenever you want and study to your heart's content. 
    Moon Dancer Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle But first, you've gotta do something for me. 
    Moon Dancer What? 
    Twilight Sparkle Have dinner with our old friends tonight. 
    Moon Dancer I can't. I'm reorganizing my biology scrolls. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been spending a lot of time with Minuette, Twinkleshine, and Lemon Hearts since I've been back. They really miss you. 
    Moon Dancer Look! I already told you! The last thing I need is a bunch of ridiculous friend-making keeping me from studying! 
    Twilight Sparkle Moon Dancer, wait! A wise pony once taught me that there's more to life than dusty old books! 
    Moon Dancer I tried friendship and it's just not for me. Now, if you'll excuse me... 
    Twilight Sparkle What if I taught you Hayscartes' method? 

    Minuette So, uh, what are you studying these days? 
    Moon Dancer Science, magic, history, economics, pottery. Things like that. 
    Minuette Yowza!  You planning on being a professor or something? 
    Moon Dancer No. 
    Minuette So you're just... studying. 
    Moon Dancer Can I go now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Moon Dancer, please. 
    Minuette It's all right, Twilight. We're having a good time. Right, everypony? 
    Twinkleshine and Lemon Hearts  
    Minuette So, uh... Spike, tell Moon Dancer that story 'bout how Twilight had to read a book about doing a sleepover! 
    Spike  
    Moon Dancer Slumber 101? I've read that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh!  Really? Well, uh, did you know Lemon Hearts here works at the Canterlot palace? 
    Lemon Hearts Uh, yeah. It's true. I do the big events mostly. State dinners, that sort of thing. 
    All but Moon Dancer  
    Moon Dancer Ugh! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Moon Dancer!  You've gotta give friendship a chance! 
    Moon Dancer Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then â€“ it isn't gonna work out now! 
    Spike Twilight, are you all right? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. No, I'm not. 
    Spike W-Where are you goin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Spike. I really messed this one up. That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when I didn't show up. 

    Minuette Hey, Moon Dancer! Look at this spread, huh? 
    Moon Dancer Thank you so much for coming! 
    Twinkleshine Of course. We wouldn't miss one of our best friends' parties. 
    Moon Dancer Is Twilight coming? 
     
    Moon Dancer Oh. Okay. 
    Minuette Hey, we'll still have fun, right?  
    Moon Dancer Sure... 

    Twilight Sparkle If there was only a way to undo the damage... I know what I need to do. And I know just who can help me. 

    Minuette  Huh. Guess they must've gone back to Ponyville. 
    Pinkie Pie Wheeeeeeeee! 
    Minuette Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie  Whoooooaaa! 
     
    Pinkie Pie That was awesome! We gotta go flying more often, Twilight! 
    Minuette There you are!  I thought you threw in the old towel and headed home! 
    Twilight Sparkle I did head home. But not to throw in the towel. I went to get my secret weapon. Minuette, meetâ€” 
    Minuette Hey! Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Hi, Minuette! Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here! 
    Twilight Sparkle You two know each other? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, sure! She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids! We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville! Didn't you know that? Ha! And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship! Twilight briefed me on the way here. We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get. 
    Minuette Let's go! We can pass by the donut place on the way! 
    Spike And what are we gonna do? 
    Twilight Sparkle Just come with me. 

    Moon Dancer Ooh! A Brief History of the Wagon Harness! Huh? The Life and Times of Morari the Maneless? 

    Moon Dancer  
     
    Moon Dancer What is this? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's a party. For you. 
    Pinkie Pie Surprise! 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on in! 
    Moon Dancer Thanks but no thanks. I don't do parties. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I know. And I think it's my fault. Back when we were in school together, you invited me to a party. I was so focused on my studies that I didn't show up. 
    Moon Dancer Big deal! 
    Twilight Sparkle It was a big deal. And now that I realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party. A party in honor of my friend Moon Dancer! Please, you've got to let me make this up to you. 
    Moon Dancer And you think this is gonna do it, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, yes? 
    Moon Dancer Well, sure, why wouldn't it? That was only the first time I put myself out there, and then you didn't even bother to show up! Then you left town without saying goodbye even though we were supposed to be friends! I was humiliated! I felt like I wasn't important! I never wanted to let myself be hurt like that again! Those three finally convinced me that I had value! That other ponies might like me and want to be my friend! And you! Didn't! Show! Up!  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle You're right. This party can't make up for the way I hurt you. But please, don't let my mistake be the reason you can't be friends with anypony else. 
    Minuette We were your friends then and we'd be honored to be your friends now. 
    Moon Dancer  What? That's the librarian! The bookseller! My sister! 
    Minuette You've got a lot of friends, Moon Dancer. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Moon Dancer. I've faced magical creatures, the end of Equestria, all sorts of things. But seeing how my actions affected you, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had. 
    Moon Dancer  Thank you, Twilight. I never realized how much I needed to hear that. Now come on, everypony! Let's party! Right? 
    Pinkie Pie Right! 
     
    All YAAAAAAY!!! 

     
     

    Twilight Sparkle I think it's time for us to go, Moon Dancer. 
    Moon Dancer Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. We'll come back and visit soon. 
    Moon Dancer That would be great! You've still gotta teach me that Hayscartes technique! 
    Twilight Sparkle Deal. 
    Spike Um, Moon Dancer? It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party. 

    Moon Dancer, Minuette, Lemon Hearts, and Twinkleshine  

     

Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?

     
    Princess Luna Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready. Do your worst.  
    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle Princess Luna's turning into Nightmare Moon again! 
    Nightmare Moon  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah? Well, we've got the cure for that! 
     
    Nightmare Moon  
    Main cast  

    Princess Luna  What? My dream ended... happily? That. Cannot. Happen! 

     

    Pinkie Pie Ooh, this is amazing! 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, Rarity. Thanks for setting all this up. 
    Fluttershy  A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity  Oh, my! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night... 
    Opalescence  
    Twilight Sparkle  I didn't sleep well either. 
    Applejack  Mm-hmm. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh-huh. 
    Pinkie Pie I'm totally beat too! 
    Winona  
    Applejack All right, Winona. Time for your brushin'. 
    Gummy  
     
    Applejack Oops. I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right. 
    Fluttershy  I even went to bed early last night... but then I had a really scary nightmare. 
    Rest of main cast Me too! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, mine sure was. There was this blue smoke monster and... what? 
    Fluttershy I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too! 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity Me too! 
    Rainbow Dash So what? Probably just a coincidence. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's an awfully big coincidence. 
    Spike Huh. I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare. I slept great! 
    Rarity So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, but I do know who might. Spike, could you send a scroll to Princess Luna? 
    Spike Sure! All set! 
    Twilight Sparkle Dear Princess Luna, last night my friends and I all dreamt of a creature made of blue smoke. I'm sure you're very busy, but  Princess Twilight Sparkle. You can leave out the yawns. 
     
    Spike  
     
    Princess Luna Which of you saw the creature of blue smoke in your nightmare?! 
    Fluttershy Wow. That was fast. 
    Twilight Sparkle We all did. 
    Spike Not me! 
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  Ugh, we know! 
    Twilight Sparkle So you've encountered the smoke monster too? 
    Princess Luna The Tantabus is a creature of my nightmares. It escaped from my slumbers yesterday. 
    Fluttershy But how did it get into ours? 
    Princess Luna The Tantabus is like a parasite. My dreams must no longer be enough for it. Now it seeks others to infect and corrupt. It must have learned of you six from seeing you in my dream. 
    Spike Whoa-whoa-whoa. So what you're saying is... you dreamt about all of them, and not me?  
    Rainbow Dash Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams. No biggie. 
    Princess Luna I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, okay, okay, I take it back! That does sound bad! Really bad! 

    Twilight Sparkle We've prepared everything exactly as you requested. 
    Princess Luna Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! It'll be like a princess sleepover! 
    Twilight Sparkle Speaking of princesses, aren't you gonna ask Celestia for her help as well? 
    Princess Luna There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight. 
    Applejack Even us? 
    Princess Luna Especially you. You have all suffered so much because of me. You need only slumber while I hunt the Tantabus in your dreams. 
    Spike I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony! I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case! 
    Twilight Sparkle Aw, thank you, Spike! 
    Applejack  One good thing about not sleepin' well last night â€“ shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you kidding?! This is so exciting, I don't know how I'm ever going toâ€”  
    Rest of main cast  
     

    Rarity Oh, my!  This is simply divine! How avant garde! 
     
    Rarity Forget avant garde! I should have said en garde!  
    Princess Luna It is here! 
     
    Rarity  It was such a pretty little chiffon...! What kind of monster would do this?! 
    Princess Luna The Tantabus. 
    Rarity Then let's stop it! 
    Princess Luna No, please! I don't want you to suffer anymore because of me. I will catch it. 
     
     
     
    Princess Luna It has jumped into another dream! I am sorry, but if I am to stop it, I must follow it where you cannot. 
    Rarity Go! I should be able to handle things here.  I hope...! 

    Pinkie Pie La-la-la-la-la! Whee! Whee, ha-ha! 
     
    Pinkie Pie La-la-la-la-la! 
    Princess Luna I followed the Tantabus here. Now I need only findâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Sorry, can't help it! An idea pops into my head, itâ€”  Ooh, cake! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Ew, cake! 
     
     
    Princess Luna  No! 
    Pinkie Pie Sorry! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Who wants ice cream?! 

    Fluttershy Mmm, it's so nice to be the pet for once. 
     
    Giant Evil Angel  
    Fluttershy N-n-n-n-nice... giant... evil Angel...!  Phew! Oh, thank you, princess! 
     
     

    Applejack  Now this is what I call an incredible dream. 
     

     
    Princess Luna I can see the Tantabus has already turned your slumbers into a nightmare! 
    Rainbow Dash What are you talking about? This is my favorite dream! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Hyah! 
    Sunflowers 

        We are such happy flowers 
        We will now sing for hours 
        Aren't we unbearably cute? 
        Watch me solo on jazz flute 
         

    Rainbow Dash  

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Huh?  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Luna! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Main cast  
    Spike What happened? Are you guys okay? 
    Fluttershy That... that was terrible! I-I never want to have that nightmare again! 
    Rainbow Dash  Me either! 
    Spike But Luna caught it, didn't she? 
    Princess Luna I am so sorry, my friends. I failed. It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep. 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! 
    Applejack Yeah. I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again. 
    Princess Luna But you will. Again and again, every night, until it grows powerful enough to infect the waking world! After what I did as Nightmare Moon, the fact that I am once again responsible for harming others is more than I can bear. 
    Pinkie Pie It'll be okay! Everypony makes mistakes! 
    Princess Luna As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late. 
    Pinkie Pie Phew, that's good to hear! Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for. See, what'd I tell ya? Everypony makes mistakes! 

    Twilight Sparkle But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare! 
    Princess Luna It is far worse than that. Infecting all those dreams gives it more and more power. Soon it will be able to escape into the real world and infect Equestria with its nightmare plague! 
    Rarity Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens! 
    Fluttershy But how? The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to! 
    Princess Luna It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having one dream? 
    Princess Luna I... can create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take... 
    Fluttershy Well, it is worth a try, isn't it? 
    Princess Luna Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream. 
    Spike  
     

     
    Derpy  
    Twilight Sparkle  Princess Luna did it! 
    Applejack  Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to see somethin' familiar! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Princess Luna Ponies! 
    Ponies Princess Luna! 
    Princess Luna There is no time for bowing, my friends! There is something coming, something terrible! No, it is already here! 
     
     
    Princess Luna I am so sorry! I brought this upon you! But I will end it now! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Princess, what's wrong? 
    Princess Luna  It... is taking all my strength just to hold this massive dream together! You will have to stop it! I truly wish I did not have to ask this of you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Then you're in luck. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! We're already on it! 
     
    Filthy Rich  Please! I'll pay you anything! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash I got you! 
     
     
    Crescent Moon  
     
     
    Applejack Oh, no! 
     
    Applejack Big Mac! You can do anythin' in a dream, remember? 
     
    Big McIntosh Wheeeeee!  
    Rainbow Dash Come on! If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it! And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world! 
     
    Applejack How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I think we'll know. 
     
     
    Princess Luna  Hurry, my friends! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What the?! 
    Fluttershy Please, we need your help too! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping! 
    Mr. Cake But how can we help? Nopony in Ponyville has your magic or your speed! 
    Rainbow Dash That's true... in Ponyville! 
    Applejack But this here isn't Ponyville! It's a dream! 
     
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Twilight Sparkle And not just any! This is your dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now! 
    Spike  Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right? Hi-yah! 
    Derpy Whoo! 
     
     
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash It's working! 
    Twilight Sparkle But it's not enough! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Then do more! This is a dream, remember? 
     
     
    Princess Luna  I cannot hold this dream together much longer! Equestria will fall because of me! 
     
    Spike Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna! 
    Princess Luna If that is so, then perhaps that is how it grew strong enough to escape in the first place! 
    Applejack Say what now?! 
    Princess Luna I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night...  ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon! 
    Fluttershy But why would you do that?! 
    Princess Luna To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more! 
    Twilight Sparkle But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did! 
    Princess Luna How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare! 
    Twilight Sparkle But look at what you're doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! You're doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust us enough to believe we're right? 
     
    Princess Luna ...I do! 
     
     
    Princess Luna Thank you. Thank you all. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  Luna did it! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack She sure did! Only... I'm not exactly sure what she did. 
    Twilight Sparkle Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did... 
    Spike Poof! 
    Fluttershy Shh! 
    Spike Huh. Wonder what she's dreaming about now. 

     

Canterlot Boutique

     
     
    Rarity  
     
    Rarity  
     
    Rarity  Was that the Pony Post?! 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Oh, it's just you, Opal. 
    Opalescence  
    Rarity Ohhh... Every other day he's here like clockwork! Not today! What could possibly be holding him up?! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Strawberry cinnamon cilantro salutations! 
    Rarity What? 
    Pinkie Pie What indeed. I bet you're wondering what warrants such a welcome! Well, that welcome is warranted by a pony that whisked up a warm batch of strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcakes! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Ugh. So I came here to offer you some! 
    Rarity After that visually descriptive and disturbing endorsement, I'll pass. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, I almost forgot! I have this letter for you, Rarity! The post pony was going to deliver it, but after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake, he was feeling kinda queasy. And since I was heading over anyway, I figured I could do it for him! Here you go! 
    Rarity  
     
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie  What's it say? 
    Rarity I got it! 
    Pinkie Pie Woo-hoo! Got what? 
    Rarity Oh, I have been holding out for the perfect location, and it finally became available! So now I can fulfill my dream of opening a boutique in Canterlot! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoo! I'm so excited, I think I'm gonna lose my cupcakes!  

     

     
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity's such a savvy businesspony. I'm so impressed she used the huge bonus she earned making the costumes for Sapphire Shores' Equestria-wide tour to open this second boutique! 

    Main cast sans Rarity  
    Rarity I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique? 
    Fluttershy It's lovely. 
    Applejack Gosh, Rarity. I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub! 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know. Those hooves don't look nubby. They look scrubbied and buffied and pedied! 
    Rarity Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard! However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles! 
    Sassy Saddles Bust my buttons, Rarity! The ponies from Ponyville! 
    Main cast sans Rarity  
    Rarity I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resumÃ© and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot! 
    Sassy Saddles I then laid out this plan, or "pattern" as we say in the fashion biz, for Canterlot Carousel so that Rarity's boutique will be a guaranteed success and those doors will never, ever, ever close! 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Sassy. Your attention to detail is truly impressive. 
    Sassy Saddles I've already put a pin in the first piece of the pattern â€“ Beautify the Boutique! But next was the very crucial pattern piece â€“ Marketing to the Mares! Turns out that everypony here loves royalty! 
    Rarity So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot! 
    Sassy Saddles And it just so happens there's a hot new princess in Equestria! 
    Rarity  In every poll Sassy Saddles took, you were the most popular princess! Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation! 
     
    Main cast sans Rarity  
    Rarity While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with "Rarity's Rules of TLC"! 
    Pinkie Pie Judging by this baby, TLC stands for Tasty Liquorice Candy! 
     
    Rarity TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'. And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture. 
     
    Rarity But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented! 
    Sassy Saddles My marketing research also confirmed that customers that viewed somepony famous wearing a gown wish to own that gown for themselves. I call this piece of the pattern Celebrity Status! 
    Rarity So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight? 
    Twilight Sparkle If being a princess and wearing that dress can help your boutique in any way, then I say stick a pin in it. It's done. 
    Sassy Saddles Alright, everypony! Let's set the stage! 
    Rarity Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique! 
     
    Sassy Saddles Welcome to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel! 
     

    Sassy Saddles Oh, hello! Oh, nice to see you! Welcome, welcome! Oh, I'm so happy to...  
    Applejack That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, no! Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?!  Okay. Phew! 
    Rarity Oh, I don't think she meant to. 
    Sassy Saddles Rarity, are you ready to reveal the collection? 
    Applejack  Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself? 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah. 
    Rarity Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready? 
    Fluttershy Oh, certainly. 
     
    Rarity Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you â€“ again  â€“ to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city! 
     
     
     
    Fashion Plate Rarity, I'mâ€” 
    Rarity Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine! I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique! 
    Fashion Plate Well, when Sassy Saddles calls, saying she's found the latest and greatest in fashion, we hightail without fail! Now tell me all about your latest collection! 
    Rarity Oh, uh, it's called "Rarity's Royal Regalia". 
    Fashion Plate  Royally radiant! 
    Rarity My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it "In-spire-ation". 
     
    Fashion Plate Genius! Simply genius! 
    Rarity I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown â€“ "Water Filly"! 
     
    Fashion Plate Oh, the whimsy! 
    Rarity Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day...  This is "Tripping the Light". 
     
    Fashion Plate Fantastic! 
    Rarity  And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this "Over the Moon"! 
     
    Fashion Plate Well, I certainly am! 
    Rarity And for our finale, I have something very special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this "The Reign in Stain"! 
    Fashion Plate Because the dress is inspired by theâ€” 
    Fashion Plate and Rarity â€”stained glass window of a reigning princess! 
    Rarity Yes! 
    Sassy Saddles Oh, well, I think "The Reign in Stain" is too difficult to explain!  Especially for the signature piece of a collection? 
    Rarity But I rather like theâ€” 
    Sassy Saddles Fillies and gentlecolts, I, Sassy Saddles, am pleased to introduce the grand finale of the grand opening of Rarity's Royal Regalia â€“ the "Princess Dress"! 
    Fashion Plate  Success! 
     
    Sassy Saddles Everypony, please follow me and you can all place your orders for the Princess Dress! 
     
    Fashion Plate Rarity, I want to be the first pony to congratulate you! The Princess Dress has just guaranteed Canterlot Carousel's success!  
     
    Main cast sans Rarity and Twilight  
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah! Rarity's Royal Regalia is amazing! And everypony seemed to love the Princess Dress! 
    Sassy Saddles You bet your saddle they did. Rarity now has one hundred orders for her signature gown! 
    Rarity  One hundred orders?! All at one time?! 
    Sassy Saddles According to my pattern, the next piece is The Success of the Signature Dress, so I do not see the problem! 
     
    Applejack Uh... 
    Pinkie Pie Cupcake? 
    Rarity  First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself. 
    Sassy Saddles  My research shows that your "Reign in Stain" name was a play on words that was both very confusing and quite unappealing. 
    Rarity  While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy. 
    Sassy Saddles My only goal is for Canterlot Carousel to succeed. That's why I changed the name, and that is why I took all those orders for the Princess Dress. 
    Rarity  it's just too much too soon! 
    Sassy Saddles Are you actually saying we should... cancel these orders?! 
    Rarity Wha... But...  Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC. 
    Sassy Saddles Oh, thank you, Rarity, thank you! 
    Rarity  

    Sassy Saddles Oh, satin and silk, Rarity, are you sure you don't want your friends to help you make the dresses? 
    Rarity No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity! 
    

        The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality 
        This I can assure 
        For each and every dress 
        I vow to give finesse 
        With time, love, and couture 

        My favorite moment's when a pony sees it 
        That special gown that she just adores 
        That pony's now in style 
        My hard work's all worthwhile 
        Oh, yes, it makes my heart 
        My heart just soar 

     

    

        The rules of Rarity, just a parody 
        No dress here's unique 
        The panels all the same 
        Each colored windowpane 
        I fashion only makes me want to shriek! 
         

        Oh, to create would give me elation 
        To feel once again some inspiration 
        Come on now, Rarity 
        Give me some clarity 
        Time for your couture love to rule 

        The rules of Rarity, extra TLC 
        This feels more sublime 
        Soon now, they will see how good these can be 
        With a little extra shine 

        The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality 
        All can see it's true 
        These new gems add such flair 
        Their beauty can't compare 
        This old style suddenly gleams anew 
         

     
     
    Rarity Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress? 
    Sassy Saddles I'll take care of her. You keep working. 
    Rarity Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress. 
    Sassy Saddles Paisley and poplin, Rarity, look at all the orders you still have to finish, and you want to take a break? Now? 
    Rarity Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dressâ€” 
    Sassy Saddles You did what?! But every Princess Dress is supposed to be exactly the same! 
    Rarity Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, andâ€” 
    Sassy Saddles Fine. Go see her reaction. 

    Rarity Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel! I am so pleased to present to you yourâ€” 
    "Cayenne" Princess Dress! Finally! I've been simply desperate to get this ever since I saw Princess Twilight wearing it on yourâ€” ...Wait a minute. There's something different. 
    Rarity Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details. 
     
    Rarity I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me. Aren't they lovely? And so unique! 
    "Cayenne"  They're... fine. But they're not what I ordered, are they? 
    Rarity Uh, no. No, they're not. 
    "Cayenne" I want the dress to be exactly like the one Princess Twilight wore. Understand? 
    Rarity Yes... Y-Yes, of course. 
    

        The rules of Rarity 
        Once stood for something 
        But now it feels just like some factory 
        Now every dress I make 
        With every flaw and mistake 
        Oh, how it makes my heart 
        My heart just break 

     
    Sassy Saddles Raving rick-rack, Rarity! You made two hundred Princess Dresses! 
    Rarity  Yes. Isn't it spectacular? 
    Sassy Saddles And I have a special surprise for you! The latest issue of Cosmare magazine just hit the stands! 
    Rarity  "Canterlot's newest rising star"? 
    Sassy Saddles And in the hour since the magazine's come out, we've gotten another hundred new orders for the Princess Dress! 
     
    Rarity  One... hundred more... Princess Dresses?! I'm the Cosmare cover pony... I have the most successful shop in Canterlot... I've gotten everything I ever wanted... but I'm miserable! 
    Sassy Saddles  How could you possibly be miserable? My pattern is perfect! Cosmare Cover Pony â€“ done! You have your signature gown, the Princess Dress of Success! 
    Rarity I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses! 
    Sassy Saddles I have a piece for that! Assemble the Assembly Line! You'll never have to sew again! 
    Rarity What?! No! 
    Sassy Saddles Yes! Then the Canterlot Carousel never closes! And Sassy Saddles' boutique succeeds! 
    Rarity Stop! This is not your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! I'm closing Canterlot Carousel! 
    Sassy Saddles What?! No! Oh, you can't, Rarity! I-I've worked too hard to make this a success! I can't be a part of another failed boutique! 
     
     
     
    Rarity  Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time. Hm. 
     
    Rarity Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel. 
     
    Pretzel Hey, is this Princess Dress on sale? 
    Rarity Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued. But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today. 
    "Moonlight Raven"  Whoa. This dress completely speaks to my soul. Can I try it on? 
    Rarity Certainly. The dressing area is right back there. 
    "Sunshine Smiles" This is the most amazing of amazing dresses! Just looking at it brightens my day! 
    Rarity And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on! 
    "North Point" Do you still have this In-spire-ation dress that's in the new issue of Cosmare? 
    Rarity Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here. 
    "North Point" Bats in the belfry! I have to try it on! 
    "Moonlight Raven"  Whoa. This dress makes me feel like a princess. 
    "Sunshine Smiles" And this dress makes me feel like a princess! 
    "Citrus Blush" This gown is quite beautiful, but it totally clashes with my complexion. 
    Rarity Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the "Fountain of Truth"! 
    "Citrus Blush" It's exactly what I've been dreaming of! 
    Rarity Oh! Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours!  How can I have forgotten? This is what I've been dreaming about! 
    

        My favorite moment's when a pony sees it 
        That special gown that she just adores 
        That pony's now in style 
        My hard work's all worthwhile 
        Oh, yes, it makes my heart 
        My heart just soar! 

    Rarity Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will not be closing! 
     
    "Moonlight Raven"  But this stuff's still on sale, right? 
    Rarity  Yes, yes, of course. 
    Sassy Saddles Oh, Rarity, I'm so sorry. I focused on that one dress, and the rest of Rarity's Royal Regalia paid the price. 
    Rarity Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common. 
    Sassy Saddles I think I finally understand the Rules of Rarity... and will apply them at my next job. 
    Rarity I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville. 
    Sassy Saddles Ponyville? 
    Rarity Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base. 
    Sassy Saddles  Bobbins and bodkins, Rarity! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! And I promise to run everything following your rules. 
    Rarity I would expect nothing less. 
    "Whoa Nelly" Oh, my gosh, a sale! Do you have the Princess Dress?! 
    Rarity and Sassy Saddles No!  

     

Rarity Investigates!

    Rarity Oh, Sassy Saddles, don't you just love my new Femme Mystique Chic line of gowns? 
    Sassy Saddles  Sequins and sashes, Rarity, they're exquisite! Where in Equestria did you find the inspiration? 
    Rarity Oh, I modeled them after the adventures of Shadow Spade. Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all... fabulous costumes! 
    Sassy Saddles They're perfect!  What are you doing? 
    Rarity  Shadow Spade believes it all comes down to attention to detail. And so do I. There! Now it's perfect. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey guys, how's itâ€” 
     
    Rarity and Sassy Saddles  
    Rainbow Dash  My bad. 

     

    Rainbow Dash  Sorry I messed up your dress thingy. 
    Sassy Saddles Nothing we can't fix in a stitch. What are you doing in Canterlot? 
    Rainbow Dash I'm here for Princess Celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow. 
    Sassy Saddles Oh, yes! Rumor has it the gardens are especially lush this season. I heard that the Wonderbolts will be kicking things off with an aerial display. 
    Rarity You heard right. And Rainbow Dash is here to fly with them. So exciting! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, kind of exciting. Technically, I'm not flying. I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform. 
    Rarity Oh, don't be so modest. Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen. 
    Rainbow Dash It is pretty sweet. And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight. Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right? 
    Rarity Heavens, yes! A chance to dress up, be charming and show off my newest femme mystique couture? I wouldn't miss it for all of Equestria. 
    Rainbow Dash Great! See ya tonight! 
     
     
     
     
    Rarity Ooh, the rhinestones I ordered!  Oh, my. Oh, there's been a mistake... I ordered dragon-cut stones, and these are hoof-polished. 
    Delivery Pony I'm sorry, but I've got a full load of deliveries today. I'm not sure I have time to redo your order. 
    Rarity Of course you don't. Your job is so difficult. Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight. 
    Delivery Pony  It is pretty tough, what with the boxes all being... box-shaped. 
    Rarity Oh, yâ€”oh yes, and I very much appreciate it. But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful. 
    Delivery Pony  Well, for you, Rarity, I'll see what I can do. 
     
    Sassy Saddles Rarity, you could sweet-talk a filly out of candy! 
    Rarity Oh, , it was nothing. Nopony minds a compliment. Now, you simply must help me pick out an outfit for tonight. Something from the new collection, of course. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Let's grab some grub! 
    Rarity  Mm, is that Juniper Phoenix I smell? 
    Rainbow Dash No, it's broccoli!  
    Wind Rider Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of my favorite stallion colognes. 
    Rarity Oh, mine as well. It's masculine and yetâ€” 
     
    Rarity â€”soft with the barest hint of floral notes andâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash  Rarity! Don't you know who this is?! 
    Rarity A gentlepony with fabulous taste in colognes and scarves? 
    Rainbow Dash It's Wind Rider! 
    Rarity Oh! So nice to meet you! 
    Rainbow Dash You didn't let me finish! He's a living legend. He holds the Wonderbolt record in the Mustang Marathon! 
    Wind Rider Well, that was a long time ago. Honestly, I can't believe I still hold the record. 
    Spitfire Wind Rider, I see you met Rainbow Dash! She's one of our most promising Reserves. She just might beat your record. 
    Wind Rider Really now? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, heh, I'm nowhere near as good as you. I mean, I'm fast, but I don't have the endurance to go long distances. 
    Spitfire Ah, don't be modest. A little practice and you'll be beating records in no time. 
    Wind Rider Heh-heh. Well, it's nice to meet you fillies. 
    Rainbow Dash  I can't believe I just met Wind Rider! 
    Misty Fly Yeah, he's coming out of retirement to take the spot of honor in the center of our aerial flower formation tomorrow. 
    Rainbow Dash  Really? That's incredible! Guess I'll just watch Wind Rider being awesome from the sidelines... Practice tomorrow is gonna be so boring. 
    Rarity I don't suppose I could keep you company? 
    Rainbow Dash You could! They always let friends and family come watch practices! 
     
    Rarity Mm, ooh! 
    Rainbow Dash Oops. Heh, sorry about that. Lemme help you clean that up.  
    Rarity Uh, no-no, it's almost impossible to get stains out of silk. But not to worry. I've come prepared! 

    Rarity That dinner was absolutely divine. Thanks for inviting me! Ooh, you're staying in the east tower? Those rooms have the best view of Canterlot! 
    Spitfire How lucky are we? Well, we better get some shuteye before practice. 
     
    Rainbow Dash See you tomorrow, Rarity! 
    Rarity Good night! 

    Rainbow Dash  Thanks for keeping me company, Rarity. If you weren't here, well, I don't know who I'd be talking to right now. 
     
    Soarin Eh, you'd be talkin' to me. Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's mom sent a message that she was sick. She had to leave to take care of her. 
    Rainbow Dash  Oh, no! I hope her mom's okay! 
    Soarin Me too. In the meantime, we need you to fly in her place. 
    Rainbow Dash L-Like, in the actual show? 
    Soarin Unless Spitfire comes back, yes. 
    Rainbow Dash I won't let you down, Soarin!  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh... 
    Soarin Uh... Rainbow Dash? 
    Rarity  Shh! Let her have this, darling. 

    Rarity Hello there! Friend or family? 
    Stormy Flare Family. My daughter's a Wonderbolt, but I don't see her up there. Do you know Spitfire? 
    Rarity Ooh, you're Spitfire's mum? But I thought you were sick. 
    Stormy Flare What? 
    Rarity Well, Spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well, and she went home to take care of you. 
    Stormy Flare I didn't send a note. 
    Rarity That's so strange. 
    Soarin Stormy Flare? Aren't you supposed to be sick? 'Kay, what's happening? 
    Stormy Flare I don't know. But I do know I didn't send my daughter a note. 
    Rarity Could somepony have sent Spitfire a fake note? 
    Misty Fly Who would do such a thing? 
    Soarin Somepony who wanted her out of the show, I suppose. 
    Rainbow Dash Why would anypony want that? 
    Wind Rider Maybe so they could take her spot. 

    Rainbow Dash Me?! I would never do that to Spitfire! Why would you think it was me? 
    Blaze I did see you and Spitfire leave the dinner together. 
    Rainbow Dash We were room neighbors in the castle! 
    Misty Fly And you did say you'd do anything to fly with Wind Rider. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, but I didn't mean anything. 
    Soarin Spitfire came by my room and told me she had to go see her mom at around midnight. Where were you then? 
    Rainbow Dash I was asleep at midnight... having this totally amazing dream. There I was at the arena flying with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, like I've always wanted toâ€” 
     
    Rainbow Dash â€”ah, eh, never mind. Not helping. 
     
    Soarin Rainbow Dash, if you can prove that somepony else is behind Spitfire's disappearance before the start of the show, then you can still fly with us. In the meantime, Misty Fly, Blaze, head over to Stormy Flare's house and try to find Spitfire and bring her back.  I have to warn you, if you sent that letter, the bylaws are clear. I'd have no choice but to ban you from the Wonderbolts forever. Understand? 
    Rainbow Dash  I understand. But how am I gonna prove I didn't send a letter that I didn't send? 
    Rarity With me! Detective Rarity is on the case, and we are going to get to the bottom of this faster than my costume change! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, what's with the getup? 
    Rarity Obviously, I am channeling Shadow Spade through these gorgeous garments, and she would say that the best way to prove that you didn't send the letter is to find out whoever did. First stop â€“ the scene of the crime! 

     
    Rarity  We had a long road ahead of us, Rainbow Dash and I. Well, not too long because we didn't have much time, but the point is... I was up for the challenge. 
     
    Rarity  Hmm. These look like hairs from a rainbow mane! 
    Rainbow Dash  That's not good. 
    Rarity  Rainbow Dash was getting antsy, but I had faith I could clear her name and find the real culprit. 
    Rainbow Dash What are you doing? 
    Rarity  Ooh! The damask pattern on these curtains is exquisite! Oh, and this velvet rope-holder â€“ oh, it's justâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash We don't have time to look at the dÃ©cor! They're gonna kick me out of the Wonderbolts unless we solve this thing! 
    Rarity I know, Rainbow, and I'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet! Here's what I'm thinking somepony had to bring Spitfire that letter, which means somepony must have seen them! 

    Rarity I just have a few questions for you, and I'm sure once we get some things cleared up, we'llâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day!  Where were you on the night of last night at midnight?! 
    Castle Guard 1 We were here, guarding the hallway entrance like we were supposed to. 
    Rainbow Dash A likely story. 
    Castle Guard 1 I'm telling you, we were there all night, and no one went in or out of that hallway. 
    Castle Guard 2 Except for you. 
    Rainbow Dash What are you tryin' to say?! 
    Castle Guard 2 Just that there are only two rooms in the northwest wing yours and Spitfire's. So the only other pony who had access to that wing was you. 
    Rarity  Perhaps I should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring. 
    Castle Guard 1 It is. I've counted all three hundred and forty five bolts in the ceiling tiles two hundred and ninety three times! 
    Rarity And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it. 
    Castle Guard 1 Oh, you're right. We don't get a lot of recognition for what we do. 
    Castle Guard 2 Except for last night when somepony was nice enough to leave a cake for us. So we did take one little break when we ate that cake. 
    Rarity What kind of cake was it? 
    Castle Guard 2 Cherry with a custard filling. 
    Rarity Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate? 
    Castle Guard 1 Chocolate. 
    Rarity Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes? 
    Castle Guard 1 It was. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, who cares how it was decorated?! 
    Rarity  Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing. 
    Rainbow Dash Do you? 
    Rarity Oh, oh, oh. Did I say that one out loud? 
    Rainbow Dash I mean, even I think I'm guilty at this point! I really did want to fly in that show! What if I wrote that note when I was asleep?! Do you know what I do when I sleep?! Because I sure don't! 
    Rarity Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash. We'll get to the bottom of this. There's only one bakery in Canterlot that makes a chocolate cherry cake with custard filling and buttercream frosting rosettes and that's... 

    Rarity ...Cinnamon Chai's Tea and Cake Shop! 
    Cinnamon Chai Hello, how can I help you? 
    Rarity I've heard you have the best chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town! 
    Cinnamon Chai Ah, you travel in the right circles! We have the only chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town! 
    Rarity Oh, no. But somepony's already bought it! Who was the lucky pony? 
    Cinnamon Chai  I can't even say! 
    Rarity Why? Because it was somepony famous? 
    Cinnamon Chai No... because it was hard to tell! She was wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, and a scarf around her head that covered most of her face. But I do remember she had a really deep, raspy voice. 
    Rainbow Dash What do you mean, raspy? 
    Cinnamon Chai Well, kinda like yours. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity If there's anything else you can remember, dish. 
    Cinnamon Chai Well, have I got a story for you! The pony who bought the cake threw a big fit when she accidentally got chocolate ganache on her scarf! 
    Rarity That's terrible! What color was the scarf? 
    Cinnamon Chai White! No, maybe more an ivory... 
    Rarity You don't say! 
    Rainbow Dash I can't believe you're talking fashion at a time like this! 
    Rarity Rainbow, don't panic. I need you to trust me. 
    Rainbow Dash Trust you?! You've spent more time changing clothes than trying to help me! I'm doomed! 
    Rarity No, you're not! Come on! 

    Rarity  Rainbow Dash was obviously upset, but I had all my ducks in a row. Except one. 
     
    Rarity  She was not going to like it, but there was only one way to find out if my suspicions were correct. 

     
     
    Blaze We looked everywhere, but Spitfire wasn't at her mom's house! 
    Stormy Flare Where could she be? 
     
     
    Rarity I have found the culprit! 
    Soarin  
    Rarity Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it. And that pony was none other than... Wind Rider! 
     
     

    Rainbow Dash Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me! He's a living legend, for pony's sake! 
    Rarity All the evidence points to him! 
    Rainbow Dash Peh! What evidence could you possibly have? All you did was ask about cake, admire dÃ©cor, and change outfits a gazillion times! 
    Rarity Let me explain. I never believed you would send Spitfire away. When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out. They... were cut! Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter? 
    Wind Rider Juniper Phoenix is a very popular fragrance, and anypony could have moved those curtains. 
    Rarity Precisely why I questioned the castle guards! They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake. A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide the chocolate stain?! 
     
    Wind Rider Ah, this is preposterous. Wonderbolts, you don't believe a word of this, right? 
    Rarity Just admit it â€“ you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf! 
    Wind Rider Ah, fine! You caught me! I did it! 
    Rainbow Dash But why, Wind Rider?! Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it? 
    Rarity No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not. 
    Wind Rider I thought if I could get Rainbow Dash kicked out of the Wonderbolts forever, my record could be preserved. 
    Rainbow Dash Really? That is so not cool. And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever. Until now. 
    Wind Rider I did what I had to do to protect my record! Sometimes you gotta play dirty to be the best! 
    Rainbow Dash That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about. 
    Soarin She's right! Wonderbolts look out for each other! Which reminds me, where is Spitfire? 
    Wind Rider I sent her the letter pretending to be Stormy Flare. I told her I had Pegasitis, and the only cure is the ice iris in the Crystal Mountains. 
    Rainbow Dash No wonder she's been gone so long. Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring! 
    Soarin The Crystal Mountains are too far for anypony to make it there and back before the royal garden opening! Rainbow Dash, we need you to fly in Spitfire's place! 
    Rainbow Dash But Spitfire shouldn't have to miss this! I'm gonna get her! 
    Soarin But you'll never make it in time! 
    Rainbow Dash Then there's no time to lose! 

    Blaze Rainbow Dash is still gone! 
    Rarity Oh, don't panic. If I know Rainbow Dash, she'll come through. 
     
    Spitfire  
    Soarin Spitfire, you're back! I can't believe you made it! 
    Spitfire  I wouldn't have, if Rainbow hadn't found me so fast! Gave me enough time to fly back! 
    Rainbow Dash Rare, I couldn't have done it without you. And I'm sorry I doubted you. But why didn't you tell me what you were doing? 
    Rarity Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain. 
    Rainbow Dash Thank you for believing in me, even when I was doubting you. I'm some friend, huh? 
    Rarity Actually, you're quite a good friend. You went to get Spitfire, even though it meant you couldn't fly today. 
    Rainbow Dash  I'll get my chance one day. 
    Spitfire Or today. How'd you like Wind Rider's spot in the show? 
    Wind Rider Uh, w-w-what? Y-You can't do this to me! I'm one of the greatest Wonderbolts there ever was! 
    Spitfire Not anymore. For attempting to frame Rainbow Dash, I hereby strip you of your Wonderbolts status! 
    Soarin  So, would you like to fly with us? 
    Rainbow Dash Would I?! Woo-hoo! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, aww yeah... 
    Soarin Uh, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash  Coming! 

    Rarity  So my friend got her moment in the sun. Or the center of an aerial flower, as the case may be. And as for me? I got a chance to show off my Femme Mystique Chic collection! 
    Stormy Flare That's nice, dear. 
    Rarity Oh, did I say that out loud? 

     

Made in Manehattan

    Twilight Sparkle Ehh...  I'm bored. 
    Spike But you're reading. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've read all these books already. 
    Spike And...? 
    Twilight Sparkle And I'm bored! I wanna do something! Things have been so slow around here and I justâ€” 
    Rarity Twilight! Twilight! Ooh, Twilight, darling! Oh, thank goodness! It seems that myâ€” 
    Applejack  Whew! Got here as fast Iâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle  Yes! Finally! We've been summoned! I wonder where the map wants us toâ€” 
    Spike Uh, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Applejack Where do you thinkâ€” 
    Rarity  Manehattan! We've been called to Manehattan! Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit! And now I return... with a purpose! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmmm. It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here. 
    Rarity We're off to solve a friendship problem in one of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria! Isn't this exciting?!  
    Applejack Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan? 
    Twilight Sparkle You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to tackle this particular mission. 
    Applejack But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville. 
    Rarity Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times! Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District â€“ it's also home to the Fashion District!  Hmm. Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling. You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's such an exciting city, and there's still so much I'd like to do there. So many museums and historical landmarks to visit. Not to mention all the libraries! But this is your mission. Heh-heh. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty of... books... to keep me... busy. 
    Spike  
    Rarity and Applejack Mm-hmm. 
    Rarity  I just remembered something! The Sisterhooves Social! 
    Applejack We'll have to miss it. No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan. I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset. 

     
     
    Rarity Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me! 
    Applejack  
    Rarity Darling, are you all right? 
    Applejack Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home.  Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open. 
    "Rivet"  
    Rarity Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence! 
    "Rivet"  
    Rarity Yoo-hoo! 
    Applejack  
    Pedestrian Pony 1 Move it! 
    Applejack Sorry 'bout that. 
    Strawberry Ice Ah, get outta my way! 
    Applejack Sorry. 
    Pedestrian Ponies 3 & 4 Watch it! 
    Applejack Heyâ€” Oh, dear. Butter my biscuits. I can barely cross the street in this town. How am I supposed to help solve aâ€” 
    Rarity  There! 
    "Pearmain Worcester" Yes, I think this is the one. 
    Rarity No! No. 
    "Pearmain Worcester" Excuse me? 
    Rarity That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision. Oh, dear, none of these will do. Oh, Applejack! What good timing! 
     
    Rarity  Here. This will do splendidly. 
    "Pearmain Worcester" Oh, it's lovely! How much would you like for it? 
    Rarity Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it. I can always make another. 
    "Pearmain Worcester" Thank you! 
    Rarity  And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here! Pff. Kch. Ts! 
    Applejack Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it. 
    Rarity What? We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion. 
     
    Rarity Well, she could've been meeting a friend who would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been ruined forever! And... mmm... it's possible. 
    Applejack Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done? 
    Rarity Yeâ€” No. I suppose it didn't. Still, a disaster was averted! 
    Stinky Bottom Averted? You just lost me a paying customer! 
    Rarity Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry. I never meant toâ€” 
    Stinky Bottom Beat it! 
    Rarity Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here!  The search continues. 

    Applejack Uh, 'scuse me, I was just wonderin'... Uh, friendship problem, anypony? See, we've been sent here to... A-A map summoned us and, uh... If you could just take a moment to... 
    Rarity Friendship advice! Anypony looking for friendship advice! Good grief. This isn't working. 
    Applejack  I'm not sure what we're supposed to do. To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for. 
    Rarity Oh, try not to worry, Applejack. The map picked us for a reason. Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue. We can't possibly approach every single pony in town until we find out what we're meant to dâ€”ooh!  Darling, this is it! The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel! 
    Applejack Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours. 
    Rarity Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried! 
    Applejack Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner. 

    Coco Pommel I can't believe you found my flyer. Quite a coincidence, don't you think? 
    Rarity Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help. It's no coincidence, darling. It's fate!  
    Applejack  
    Coco Pommel An outdoor play held at the community park. Many moons ago, local theater troupes would perform, and ponies in the neighborhood would help make the costumes and design set pieces, prepare food to share during the performance. 
    Applejack Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company. Kinda reminds me of Ponyville. 
    Rarity It sounds lovely, darling. 
    Coco Pommel It was, up until several moons ago. 
    Applejack What happened? 
    Coco Pommel That's Charity Kindheart. She was a well-known costume designer on Bridleway. She started the Midsummer Theater Revival as a way to share her passion for theater with the neighborhood. No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the Revival. 
     
    Coco Pommel But when she moved away to be closer to her grandfillies, the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started, and worse, the sense of community it fostered. 
    Street Pony Hey, I'm trotting here! 
    Applejack Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity? 
    Coco Pommel I've been trying to. But I've just gotten a last-minute request to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair Filly, and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress. Oh... There's just so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival, and my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer! 
    Rarity Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it! 
    Coco Pommel You will? 
    Applejack You bet your boots we will! 
    Coco Pommel Oh, I don't wear boots. I find they chafe my calves when I walk. 
    Applejack It's just an expression. 

    Rarity So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation. 
    "Fine Print" Yeah, not a good time right now. Heh. What am I saying? It's never a good time! 

    Rarity  Well? What do you think? 
    "Chock-full Carafe" I got my own problems. You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's? 

    "Uptown Clover" Ah, yes, Charity's Midsummer Theater Revival. Such wonderful memories. 
    Applejack So you'll help us? 
    "Uptown Clover" Oh, , don't be ridiculous. I run a very important oat and hay import/export business. Why, I can't spare even a moment for such things! 
     
     

    Coco Pommel This is a nightmare. 
    Rarity Oh, not at all, darling. It's quite lovely. 
    Applejack I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival. 
    Coco Pommel I finished the alterations for My Fair Filly, but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival, and the Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow for a costume fitting and rehearsal! 
    Rarity Well, I could help you with the costumes. 
    Coco Pommel But what are we going to do about the rest? The park is in desperate need of repairs, and the sets still need to be built! 
    Applejack Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things. It's kinda, well, my thing. Could be the reason the map called me here! 
    Rarity You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here. 
    Applejack Uh-huh. 
    Rarity The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine! 

    Rarity Perhaps I spoke too soon... 
    Coco Pommel Oh, dear, you're right. Are you sure you can manage this by yourself? 
    Applejack Well, there's a lot to do, but Rarity's right. The map wouldn't have called us here if we weren't up for the challenge. You two go on and take care of the costumes. I'll see you at the dress rehearsal.  

     
     
     
     
     
     
     

    Applejack I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can. 
     
     
    Rarity Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. Everything's going to beâ€” 
    "On Stage" Um, excuse me? Is this where the Midsummer Theater Revival is supposed to be, perchance? 
    "Raspberry Beret" We're here for the dress rehearsal? 
    Coco Pommel Oh, yes! We've just put the finishing touches on the costumes. 
    "Late Show"  At least those look professional. 
    "Raspberry Beret" We'll do a dry run of the play first, and then the fitting. 
    Applejack No, wait! I haven't gotten a chance toâ€” 
     
    "Raspberry Beret"  
     
    Applejack ...reinforce the stage yet. 

    Coco Pommel  I just wanted to live up to Charity's example, to bring my neighborhood together again. But the park is still a mess, we haven't even thought about what refreshments to serve during the performance, and even if we had, we don't have a stage for the Method Mares to perform on! It's hopeless... Just hopeless! 
    Rarity  I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant! 
    Applejack I've been thinkin' the same thing. I mean, I can at least see why you're here â€“ Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all â€“ but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big. 
    Rarity  We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Whâ€” 
    Applejack Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home. 
    Rarity  Then what are you suggesting? 
    Applejack I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can. I think I've got a plan. It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'. And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right? 
    Coco Pommel I suppose so... 
    Applejack That's the spirit! Sorta... 

     
    Applejack Alright, y'all, it's ready! 
    "On Stage" Should we go ahead and start? 
     
    "Raspberry Beret"  I just moved here, and I keep getting mixed up by the street names! I had a map, but I dropped it in a puddle, which only made the street names harder to read! 
    "On Stage" I see. 
    "Cloudy Daze" What is that? 
    Blueberry Curls I dunno, sugar, looks like some kinda play. 
    "Cloudy Daze" Well, can we stay and watch it please? Please, can we, can we? 
    Blueberry Curls Oh, alright, I suppose we could stay for a minute. 
    "Late Show" Excuse me, but your next appointment is here. 
    "On Stage" Alright. Send him in.  I'm sorry, but based on these samples, I just don't think this is the place for you. 
    "Raspberry Beret"  
    "On Stage" Don't get me wrong. These clothes are all exquisite and well-made, but more theatrical than avant-garde. Have you considered costume design? I have a contact on Bridleway! If you're interested, I can put you in touch with him. ...And scene. 
     
     
     
    "Stardom" Charity, dear, is that you? 
    "Raspberry Beret" Hello, Mrs. Pearblossom! I didn't seeâ€”oops! 
    "Stardom" Oh, let me help you, dear. Are these the costumes you've been working on? 
    "Raspberry Beret" Yes, I was supposed to be finished by now, but there's just so much to do, and I still have a few last-minute alterations to make before opening night! I'm sorry I couldn't get enough tickets for everypony in the neighborhood. I hope Mr. Pearblossom wasn't too disappointed. I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites. 
    "Stardom" Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that. We're so proud of you. We shall be with you in spirit! 
    "Raspberry Beret" Thank you! You've all made me feel so welcome here and have become like family to me! I just wish I could share this experience with you and the others! 
    "Rivet" Eh, what's goin' on? 
    Luckette It's the Midsummer Theater Revival. The Method Mares are performing! 
    "Rivet"  The Revival. Mhm, yeah. My pop used to bring me. 

    "Stardom" So nice of you to put on this play for the neighborhood. 
    "Raspberry Beret" I couldn't have done it without everypony's help! I know it's not Bridleway, butâ€” 
    "Stardom" Oh, pish-tosh! It's perfect, dear! 
    Strawberry Ice  
    Pearly Stitch Oh, you're such a dear, thank you! This is so nice. Haven't seen the neighborhood this friendly since Charity moved away! 
     
    "On Stage" Thank you, fillies and gentlecolts. Please give a warm welcome to the one who made this entire event possible â€“ our neighbor Coco Pommel! 
     
    Coco Pommel  Thank you all so much for coming. The Midsummer Theater Revival was always something that meant so much to me, and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well. I really can't take all the credit, though. My dear friends Rarity and Applejack helped me ever so much. 
     
    Rarity Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes. 
    Applejack Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all. To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start. When those fell through, we decided to simplify. This here was the result. 
    Rarity Oh, don't be so modest. Coco and I were lost. 
    Coco Pommel You bet your boots we were! 

     
    "Viola" We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the Midsummer Theater Revival and how much it inspired us! 
    Applejack Oh, yeah? 
    "Uptown Clover" I used to think that to help my community I had to do something big. Heh-heh. And let's face it â€“ in this day and age, who has the time for such a commitment? But here, you did something as simple as building a stage and putting on a play and, heh, look at how it's brought everypony together. 
    "Viola" I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't think anything I'd have time to do would be that useful. Now I wish I'd offered to help, even if it was just pulling a few weeds or planting a few flowers. 
    Applejack Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up. I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better. 
    "Viola" And I will! 
    "Uptown Clover" And I don't think we'll be alone! 
     
    Applejack Yee-hoo! 
    Rarity and Applejack  
    Applejack We did it! 
    Rarity  I understand now! It all makes perfect sense! 
    Applejack Huh? 
     
    Rarity I know why the map called you here. 
    Applejack You do? 
    Rarity If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference! 
    Applejack Well, I'll be! 
    Rarity Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought! 
    Applejack Heh-heh. But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train. I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out. 
    Rarity Oh, absolutely, my dear. Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf! Stop! You're making a terrible mistake! 
    Applejack  

     

Brotherhooves Social

    Granny Smith Oh, snickerdoodle! Where is the darned thing?  I wish for once I'd remembered to label these boxes! Uh, Big Mac, be a dear and help me move those... Uh, maybe it's in that one on the bottom. 
     
     
    Granny Smith Oh, dagnabbit, it's not in there either! 
    Apple Bloom  You can't catch me! 
    Applejack  Woo-hoo! 
    Apple Bloom Hey! 
    Applejack  You trickster! 
    Granny Smith Sisterhooves Social is right around the corner. Thought it'd be nice to award the winner of the big race the ribbon from when we hosted the very first Social! If'n of course I could find the darn thing. Oh, would you looky here! My, how Apple Bloom used to love watching you make that thing fly. It's like she thought you was magic. Ah, right, enough reminiscin'. Gotta find that ribbon! If you would just help meâ€”  pull... this... box, then maybe I can... Uh, Big Mac? 
     
    Granny Smith  Found her! 

     

    Apple Bloom and Applejack S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two sisters are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Applejack forever! Yee-hoo! 
    Apple Bloom We're gonna win every competition at the Sisterhooves Social! Those other fillies aren't gonna know what hit 'em! 
    Applejack Oh. Hey there, Big Mac! Did you want somethin'? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom Hold that thought. Applejack, you are the most awesome sister ever! 
    Applejack Aw, gee-whiz. . Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, butâ€” 
    Apple Bloom It's not opinion! It's objective fact! You saved Equestria like a gazillion times, you're smart, funny, strong... Why you're the best sister of all time! Probably the best Apple of all time! Right, Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom And with you by my side, I am guaranteed to taste sweet, sweet Sisterhooves Social victory! Go, Apples, go, go, go, Apples go! 
    Applejack Uh, Apple Bloom? I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you. 
     
     
     
    Apple Bloom Oh, hey. Is that the toy we used to play with when I was little? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Apple Bloom Neat.  Alright then! Let's get back to practicin'! One more run-through of our jugglin' routine, make sure our harmonies are tight in our song, and see if we can't beat our best pie-eatin' time! 
    Applejack Hold on, sugarcube. I need a minute to talk with Big Mac. 
    Apple Bloom Mind if I go ahead and start eatin' this pie?! 
     
     
    Applejack Hey, Big Mac, you all right? 
    Big McIntosh  Yup. 
    Applejack You sure? You seemed a little down back there. 
    Big McIntosh  Nope. 
    Applejack Come on, you can tell me. You feelin' a little left out? Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time together gettin' ready for the Social. 
     
    Applejack  What in the...? 
    Apple Bloom Your cutie mark! You're being summoned, Applejack! This is so cool! 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom Wonder where you're bein' called to. Wonder what you're supposed to do when you get there. Obviously to somethin' awesome because you're awesome! But... But if you're bein' summoned to solve a friendship problem, that means you'll have to miss the Sisterhooves Social! And if you have to miss the Social, then I'll have to miss the Social, which means I won't be able to taste sweet, sweet victory!  
    Applejack Now calm down. Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what! Maybe it's just a false alarm. 

    Apple Bloom But you said it was a false alarm! 
    Applejack I said maybe it's a false alarm. Well, it's not. Rarity and I have to go to Manehattan. 
    Apple Bloom Can't you just tell that map it'll have to wait a couple days? 
    Applejack No can do, sugarcube. When duty calls, I gotta answer right away. What kind of an example would I be settin' for my little sister if I didn't? 
    Apple Bloom This can't be happening! Your extreme awesomeness is backfiring on me! 
    Applejack  Try and cheer her up, won't you? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 

     
    Granny Smith Breakfast, come and get it! 
     
     
     
    Granny Smith Oh, it's no use, Big Mac. If I know my Apple Bloom, she won't come out of a funk this funky 'til her big sister gets back. 
     
    Sweetie Belle Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours. Thought you might want to go with us. 
    Scootaloo Since Rarity and Applejack are out of town, you and Sweetie Belle can cheer on me and Rainbow Dash instead! 
    Sweetie Belle Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters. 
    Granny Smith Well, the Social's always had a pretty loose definition of what consti-ma-tutes a sister. As long as you share a bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in! 
    Sweetie Belle So what do you say? 
    Scootaloo You coming? 
    Apple Bloom Why not...? Got nothin' better to do... Lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit. 
     
    Granny Smith  Such a shame we don't live closer to all your second cousins. You could maybe do the Social with one of them instead. What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Apple Bloom What? What is it?! 

    Scootaloo Today is our big day! 
    Rainbow Dash We have so got this. I'm gonna go sign us in. 
    Sweetie Belle I guess I'm just a little jealous you two get to compete and I don't. But at least I get to be here and cheer you on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too. 
    Scootaloo Guess she changed her mind. Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory? 
    Apple Bloom Uh, not exactly. Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all. 
    Sweetie Belle  Applejack is back from Manehattan already? That must mean Rarity is back too! 
    Apple Bloom No, our sisters are still gone. But it, uh... turns out my long lost cousin... 'Orchard Blossom' was able to make it last minute.  
    Sweetie Belle Your cousin who what now? 
    Big McIntosh  

    Big McIntosh Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom. Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
    Apple Bloom  Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom. 
    Big McIntosh It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance. 
    Sweetie Belle  That's Big Mac in a dress. 
    Big McIntosh Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of the Apple clan. I am astonished in equal measure. However, I shall take this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle. 
    Sweetie Belle That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant. 
    Big McIntosh I haven't the slightest doubt. 

     
    Big McIntosh Pardon me. My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple Bloom in her stead. I trust that's acceptable to all concerned? 
    Rainbow Dash Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you. 
    Big McIntosh Why, you must be Rainbow Dash. You're Scootaloo's... say... how are y'all related again? 
    Rainbow Dash Hm. Why don't I just let you finish signing in?  But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion! 
    Big McIntosh  Now, where were we? 
     
    Apple Bloom Um, excuse me. I have to... go to the bathroom.  
    Big McIntosh  You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree? 

    Sweetie Belle Have they called your brother's bluff yet? 
    Apple Bloom No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch! 
    Big McIntosh Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair!  Hurry along now, precious! 
    Apple Bloom I can't believe they bought it! 
    Sweetie Belle It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet. 

     
    Booth Barker Bravo, bravo! Weren't those two sisters great? Now, where are our next competitors? 
    Big McIntosh Here we are! This one, please. 
    Booth Barker Excellent choice... ma'am. 
    Apple Bloom  You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down. 
    Big McIntosh  Did it now? 

    

        We all love our brothers 
        And our fathers and mothers 
        We honor them like every family should 

        But there's somethin' that's quite unique 
        When my sister's there with me 
        And we share that special bond of sisterhood

    Apple Bloom  
    Big McIntosh Just a frog in my throat, dear. Probably just need to get a sip of water. If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate. Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned. But don't you worry. We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom. 
    Apple Bloom You sure about that? 
    Big McIntosh As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom. 
    Apple Bloom  But that isn't your name! 

    Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh as Orchard Blossom C-O-U-S-I-N-S! Which two sisâ€” uh, cousins are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Applejaâ€” I mean, Orchardjackâ€” Blossom forever! 
    Big McIntosh Whee! 
    Apple Bloom Whoaaa! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom  Yay. 

     

     

    Big McIntosh Oh, I don't know why I didn't choose to wear something more casual. Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never you mind. There is still the race to be run! 
    Apple Bloom I really appreciate all the effort, Big Maâ€” cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day. 
    Big McIntosh Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter. 
    Apple Bloom I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around. 
    Big McIntosh B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to. 

    Rainbow Dash Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play! 
    Scootaloo How could I forget? We've been training all week! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish? 
    Scootaloo The alley-oop. 
    Rainbow Dash Apple toss? 
    Scootaloo Flip-flop. 
    Rainbow Dash Egg carrying? 
    Scootaloo Flutter-bomb. 
    Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo Yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Oh, dear. 
    Granny Smith  Competi-sis-tors! Take your positions! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Granny Smith  And a-ready, and a-set, go! 
    Rainbow Dash Nice jump, Scoot! 
    Big McIntosh  
     
     
    Apple Bloom Woo-hoo! 
     
    Big McIntosh  
     
    Big McIntosh  
     
     
     
    Apple Bloom Yikes! You almost squished me! 
     
    Big McIntosh Pick up those hooves, Apple Bloom! Why, you're barely movin' at a mosey! 
     
    Big McIntosh Come on, junebug, it's... like you've never carried an egg before! 
    Apple Bloom Argh! I'm goin' as fast as I can! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Apple Bloom  
     
     
    Apple Bloom  
    Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo  
    Big McIntosh Woo-hoo! 
     
    Big McIntosh  victory is ours, sweet Apple Bloom! 
     
     
    Big McIntosh Uh-oh. 
    Registration Pony "Uh-oh" indeed! 
    Apple Bloom I should've known you'd eventually get busted for bein' a stallion! 
    Registration Pony Oh, no, we've known all along. The Sisterhooves Social has always had a loose policy when it comes to what counts as a "sister". But we do have a strict policy when it comes to sportsponyship! In your "sister's" desperation to win, he used brute strength to physically take out the competitors. Uh, that kind of behavior is not just unbecoming of a lady, but quite frankly, of anypony! And for that, you two are hereby disqualified! 
    Rainbow Dash Hah! Looks like we win, squirt! 
    Scootaloo Woo-hoo! Yeah! 
     
    Apple Bloom I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack. 
    Big McIntosh  
     

    Apple Bloom You know I'm... not mad, right? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom I mean... let's face it â€“ you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom And it's not like you got me disqualified from the Social forever or anythin'. I can participate next time with Applejack. Everything's fine. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom I just don't understand why you went so crazy there at the end of the race. I mean, I know you like to win an' all, but... you wanna tell me what's goin' on? 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Apple Bloom Alright. Well, it's getting late. You comin'? 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Apple Bloom Okay. See you later, I guess... 
    Big McIntosh Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah? 
    Big McIntosh When you were little, you used to look up to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam. Things are different now. Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin' off to save Equestria. And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores, helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero. I guess I just thought... oh, never mind. Here I am about to start blabberin' on about my feelin's. You don't wanna hear all this. 
    Apple Bloom Yes, I do! 
    Big McIntosh I guess I just thought if I could... fill in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could be somepony you looked up to again. Be your hero again. Even if it was for just a day. It was foolish and I'm ashamed. Please, I just wanna be alone right now. 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere. And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you. Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help me get somethin' I want. You're my big brother. You've always been a hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be. I'm real sorry I haven't been lettin' you know that's how I feel. Guess both of us have been holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Granny Smith Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to Manehattan! 
    Apple Bloom Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother!  Hey, Big Mac? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup? 
    Apple Bloom How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset? 
    Big McIntosh  Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my eyes have ever looked upon. Though sitting here on these tree roots is a trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters. 
    Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh  

     

Crusaders of the Lost Mark

    Apple Bloom Okay, Crusaders! Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks! Any suggestions? 
    Scootaloo No, we've tried everything! 
    Sweetie Belle We've run out of ideas. 
    Apple Bloom Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders? We can do better than that! 
    

        We've been searchin' for our cutie marks 
        For a while now 
        Tryin' to find out how we fit in 

        So many ways we've tried before 
        But we keep on tryin' more 

    

        'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in 

        We'll make our mark 
        One way or another 
        We'll make our mark 
        On the day that we discover 
        The ultimate reward of our cutie marks! 

    Apple Bloom Now, that's more like it! 
    Pipsqueak Cutie Mark Crusaders! Help! 
    Apple Bloom What's wrong, Pipsqueak? 
    Pipsqueak I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers! 
    Apple Bloom We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! Hoof! 

     

    Apple Bloom  So, Pip, how would you help the school if you were elected student pony president? 
    Pipsqueak Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek! 
     
    Pipsqueak If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong! 
     
    Diamond Tiara Well, I think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old schoolhouse window. But you all know voting for me was the best choice because I convinced the school board to give that window visual appeal! 
    Apple Bloom 'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board. 
    Silver Spoon Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard! 
    Diamond Tiara  Silver Spoon! That was my big announcement for when I won! 
    Silver Spoon I was only trying to help. 
    Diamond Tiara  I don't need that kind of help! 
    Apple Bloom Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara? 
    Scootaloo Do we really need a big statue of her? 
    Sweetie Belle Especially where our playground equipment should be? 
     
    Pipsqueak A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground! 
    Diamond Tiara A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for more Diamond Tiara! 
    

        It's time to make a change 
        This is our chance 
        Don't be afraid to do what's right 
        He's it! Vote for Pip! 

        We got an opportunity 
        To have fun again 
        A vote for Pip, and you can join the fight 

        It's time for a new leader 
        It's time to make a change 
        We're here to fight for what we believe 
        (Vote for Pip!) 
        It's finally time we beat her 
        And play a better game 
        'Cause when we vote together 
        There's nothing that we can't achieve 

    

        I don't believe what I am hearing 
        I'm the only one you should be cheering 
        Pipsqueak? Try "Pip's weak!" Don't you think? 

        But a diamond is perfection 
        It's natural selection 
        So your vote better be for me, not the weakest link 

    Apple Bloom We'll let the votin' decide! 

    

        Everypony has their little secrets 

    I know you do

        A vote for me will help you keep them safe 

    Like your creepy super strength! 

        Or your mane extension 
        A little thing I won't mention 
        Or those freakish large teeth in your face! 

    Apple Bloom Come on now, ponies! Don't listen to her! 

    

        You've gotta vote for change 
        It's time for a new leader 
        End all the tyranny 
        Vote now and we can beat her 

        It's now another day 
        And we believe in what's right 

    

        Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip! 

    

        Our victory is in sight 

    Diamond Tiara Stop! Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up! 

        Pip makes promises he can't keep 
        But I can do more 

    You could really use a new bookbag 

        'Cause I'll make things happen 
        That none of you here can afford 

    To do, like, ever! 

        Wouldn't you like a little something sweet? 
        Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat 
        Who says that I can't be nice? 

        But first there's one thing 
        An itsy-bitsy little string 
        And voting for me is the price! 

    

        I've a tiny suggestion 
        That you should be aware 
        You could probably win this election 
        If you show them all you realâ€” 

    Diamond Tiara I don't recall asking you to speak! 
    All  
    Sweetie Belle Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak! 

    

        Vote! 

    

        Stand strong and don't be afraid, ponies 
        Let's free ourselves from the past 

    

    

        For Pip! 
        Vote! 

    

        He's it! Vote for Pip! Vote! 

    

        We'll let honor win out against the tyranny 
        And make a change that will last 

    

    

        For Pip! 
        Vote! 

    

        Vote for Pip! 

    

        It's time for a new leader 
        It's time to make a change 
        We're here to fight for what we believe 

    

        Vote for Pip! 

    

        It's finally time we beat her 
        And play a better game 
        'Cause when we vote together 
        There's nothing that we can't achieve 

    

        Vote for Pip! 

    Cheerilee The votes have been counted! The student pony president is... Pipsqueak! 
    Diamond Tiara Huh?! 
     
    Apple Bloom Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won! 
    Pipsqueak I couldn't have won without the hard work of my campaign managers, the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Sweetie Belle Campaign manager cutie marks! 
    Diamond Tiara Guess you're not as good as you thought, blank flanks! In fact, I demand a recount! 
    Cheerilee Trust me, Diamond Tiara. Pip won. 
    Diamond Tiara I'll be the judge of that, Miss Cheerilee! 
     
    Diamond Tiara What?! One vote! Silver Spoon! You didn't vote for me?! 
    Silver Spoon No, I didn't. 
    Diamond Tiara But you're my best friend! 
    Silver Spoon Am I? 'Cause I tried to help by mentioning your 'surprise' statue, and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to speak! You could have actually won this election if you just listened to me. You wanna know how?  Sorry. I'm not allowed to speak. 
    Diamond Tiara  
    Silver Spoon  What? I don't have to follow her drum any more. 
    Apple Bloom I know Diamond Tiara's been pretty awful, but... we should probably make sure she's okay. Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers. 

     
    Spoiled Rich Diamond Tiara! Why are you making that face? That is not the face of a winner. 
    Diamond Tiara Because... I didn't win. 
    Spoiled Rich What?! You mean I hefted all these party supplies to celebrate nothing?! 
     
    Diamond Tiara Sorry mother. 
    Spoiled Rich It's bad enough you lost to that transplant from Trottingham, but imagine if you'd lost to one of those blank flanks. As a Rich pony, you must always think of your social standing. 
    Fancy Pants Hm. 
    Spoiled Rich That starts here in Ponyville and reaches all over Equestria. Don't ever forget that, Diamond Tiara. Ever! 

    

        If I'm a diamond 
        Then why do I feel so rough? 
        I'm as strong as a stone 
        Even that's not enough 

        There's something jagged in me 
        And I've made such mistakes 
        I thought that diamonds were hard 
        Though I feel I could break 

        Would you believe 
        That I've always wished I could be somepony else? 
        Yet I can't see 
        What I need to do to be the pony I want to be 

        I've been told my whole life 
        What to do, what to say 
        Nopony showed me that 
        There might be some better way 

        And now I feel like I'm lost 
        I don't know what to do 
        The ground is sinking away 
        I'm about to fall through 

        Would you believe 
        That I've always wished I could be somepony else? 
        Yet I can't see 
        What I need to do to be the pony I want to be 

        To be the pony I want to be 

    Sweetie Belle Is it weird that I feel bad for her? 
    Scootaloo If it is, then... I'm weird, too. 
    Apple Bloom She wants to change, but she doesn't know how. 
    Sweetie Belle Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out. 

     
     
    Apple Bloom Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up! 
    Diamond Tiara What do you three want? To gloat? Rub in my defeat? 
    Apple Bloom Actually, we wanted to invite you to our clubhouse to hang out. 
    Diamond Tiara Really? 
    Scootaloo Yeah, for real! 
    Diamond Tiara Well, thanks to you all, I don't have any important class president business to attend to or anything. So I might as well. 
    Sweetie Belle That sounds like a yes... 

    Diamond Tiara So, do you three just sit around here plotting out different ways to try and get your cutie marks? 
    Apple Bloom Actually, yeah. 
    Diamond Tiara You three are... really lucky. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders We are?! 
    Diamond Tiara Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand. 
    Apple Bloom But... you've done that, right? 
    Diamond Tiara Yeah, 'cause I have my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at all to figure out who I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank! 
    Apple Bloom Uh... are you sure about that? 
    Diamond Tiara  That's a weird question. 
    Sweetie Belle Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday. 
    Diamond Tiara Were you trying to get your cutie mark in spying? Is that on your little chart? 
    Sweetie Belle No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you... 
    Apple Bloom We know you wanna change, and we think we canâ€” 
    Pipsqueak  Help! 
     
    Pipsqueak Cutie Mark Crusaders! I was at the school board meeting and they didn't approve my request for the new playground equipment! 
    Sweetie Belle Why not? 
    Pipsqueak There's no money in the budget! So I checked my Peggy bank to see if I had enough bits, but my little Peggy wasn't nearly full enough! 
    Sweetie Belle Don't worry, Pip! 
    Scootaloo We'll meet you back at school. 
    Apple Bloom And help you find a solution! 
    Pipsqueak Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Diamond Tiara Oh, I already have a solution! Our new student pony president is gonna be kicked out of office, and I'll be reinstated! 
    Scootaloo Where's she going? 
    Apple Bloom Where do you think?! C'mon! After her! 
    Sweetie Belle Wait! I'm coming too! 
    

        Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way 
        Those ponies need to know the truth 
        And they'll hear it from me 

    

        Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way 
        You know you're better than this hostility 

    

        You don't even know me at all 
        Don't understand the meaning of my fall 
        What my family would think if I ever 
        Fail at anything 

        I'm a diamond â€“ that means you'll never break 
        No matter what be the cost of the path I take 
        Whatever I have to do to win in the end 

    

        Stop! This is not the answer 
        Wait! And it's plainly seen 
        Listen! You can redeem yourself 
        But by helping others, not by being mean 

        We know you want friends who admire you 
        You want to be the star with all the power too 
        But there's a better way, there's a better wa-a-ay 

        There's so much more still left to 
        Learn about yourself 
        See the light that shines in you 
        We know you can be somepony else 

        You can stop right now 
        And try another start 
        You'll finally free yourself from the dark 
        And see the light 
        And see the light of your cutie mark 

    Diamond Tiara Everypony, I have an announcement! 

    Apple Bloom Diamond Tiara! Think hard about the choice you're makin' right now! 
    Scootaloo You can be a better pony! 
     
    Spoiled Rich Diamond Tiara! I just happened to be here for the school board meeting, and this is what I see when we adjourn? My daughter associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes? Socializing with their kind is not how you move up in Equestria! Come, Diamond Tiara! 
    Diamond Tiara No, mother! 
    Spoiled Rich Excuse me?! 
    Diamond Tiara You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have â€“ friends! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Foals and Cheerilee  
    Spoiled Rich That's enough, Diamond Tiara! Step away from those blank flanks! 
    Diamond Tiara These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father? 
    Spoiled Rich Yes, of course, dear... 
    Diamond Tiara I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment! 
     
    Diamond Tiara  I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha! Well, I think it's all gonna work out just fine, Mister President! 
    

        We'll build a playground 
        For all of us to enjoy 
        So full of games 
        There's enough for each girl and boy 

        I want to help and do 
        Everything that I can 
        I'm here to show you I changed 
        Listen up, here's the plan 

    Bring it in! That's right, keep it coming! Hey there, you with the amazing strength. Can you help them move that merry-go-round across the lawn? Thank you so much! And you with the super teeth, we need you to help with that teeter-totter. You got it! That's the spirit! 

        There's so much I can do 
        To help everypony else 
        I see the light that shines in me 
        I know I can be my better self 

        I can free the past 
        'Cause now the future's bright for me 
        My cutie mark has set me free 
        To do what's right and be the pony I want to be 

        And be the pony I want to be! 

    Apple Bloom I've been thinkin', Crusaders. We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' to discover our true talent. But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent! 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you? 
    Scootaloo Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends. 
    Apple Bloom So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks? 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
     
     
    Sweetie Belle What happened? 
    Apple Bloom What's goin' on? 
    Diamond Tiara It's your cutie marks! They're amazing! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders We all got the same cutie mark! Cutie Mark Crusaders forever! 
    

        We were searching for our cutie marks 
        For a while there 
        Trying to find out how we fit in 

        So many ways we've tried before 
        But we kept on trying more 
        'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in 

    

        Now we know what it took all along 

    

        And our journey here is never really done 

    

        For it is more than just a mark 
        It's a place for us to start 

    

        An adventure that has only just begun 

        We'll make our mark 
        Show the world what we can do 
        We'll make our mark 
        Helping fillies to break through 
        To the ultimate reward of a cutie mark 

    Pinkie Pie All right, everypony! Get ready for the biggest cute-ceaÃ±era celebration ever! 
     
    Applejack Oh, sugarcube, if Mom and Dad were here, they'd be so proud of ya. 
    Apple Bloom Oh... Thanks, Applejack. 
    Applejack Now go on and party with your pals. 

    

        I'm so proud of you, little buddy 
        You've taught me a thing or two 

    

        You've inspired everypony around you 
        And you've inspired me too 

    

        You've made your mark 
        Done Equestria so proud 
        You've made your mark 
        And we're here to sing it loud 
        For the ultimate reward of your cutie mark 

    Apple Bloom Well, what do you think, Crusaders? Were these cutie marks totally worth waiting for or what? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! I can't wait to see who we're gonna help next! 

    

        We started out just three 
        Crusaders driven to see 
        What we find in our hearts 
        Discover our destiny 

        And here we are, best friends 
        About to start it again 
        An adventure that never will end 

        We'll make our mark 
        Helping fillies most in need 
        We'll make our mark 
        So each one of them succeeds 
        'Cause the ultimate reward is a cutie mark! 

     

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows

    Pinkie Pie Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew! Look at that, Pound Cake! I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record! 
    Mrs. Cake My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here! 
    Pinkie Pie Pretty impressive if I do say so myself. 
    Mrs. Cake Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special order, and the ingredients need to be perfect. 
    Pumpkin Cake  
    Pinkie Pie Okie-dokie-lokie. 
    Mrs. Cake Thanks, dear! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?!  This is the best news ever! I can't wait to tell Twilight! 
    Mrs. Cake Oh, em, Pinkie, uh...  it's a top secret surprise. 
    Mrs. Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
     
    Pinkie Pie A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news...  ...to myself! 

     

    Pinkie Pie Even though I didn't technically make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs. Cake, I can't tell Twilight or anypony the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy? 
    Gummy  
    Pinkie Pie Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby? 
    Rarity What's all this about a baby? 
    Pinkie Pie What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?! 
    Rarity You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about? 
     
    Pinkie Pie  

    Twilight Sparkle Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting everything ready! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle It's... 
    Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor and Princess Cadance! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, and they're comingâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle Tomorrow! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, on theâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Friendship Express rather than the Crystal Empire train so as not to cause too much of a scene when they skip town to come visit?  
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. 
    Pinkie Pie Annnnnd? 
    Twilight Sparkle And that's it. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, how did you know all that? 
    Pinkie Pie  Uh... Pinkie Sense? 
     
    Rainbow Dash So, you said you needed our help with something? 
    Twilight Sparkle Follow me. 

    Rainbow Dash Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune? 
    Twilight Sparkle It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise! 
    Pinkie Pie Surprise?!  
    Twilight Sparkle I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself! 
    Pinkie Pie  I have no idea what that's like! 
    Fluttershy Aww, look at the cute little ant farm! 
     
    Spike And check out all these old comic books! 
    Twilight Sparkle Be careful! They're mint-in-bag! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie What's this? 
    Twilight Sparkle This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah!  
    Rarity It is a bit juvenile for castle dÃ©cor, but it is very sweet of you. 
    Fluttershy I'm sure Shining Armor will love it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them. 
    Applejack Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it. 
    Rest of main cast sans Twilight  
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything! 
    Rainbow Dash Totally understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise! 
    Pinkie Pie But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?! 
    Fluttershy I would say... no. 
    Rarity The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever! 
    Pinkie Pie  Gotta bounce! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual? 

     
     
    Pinkie Pie  Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be really hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything! 
    Mr. Cake Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie I... did? 

    Mr. Cake Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony. 
    Pinkie Pie I'll do it! 
    Mr. Cake Really? 
    Pinkie Pie Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies. 
    Mr. Cake Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind? 
    Pinkie Pie No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye! 

    Pinkie Pie Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never! 
    Mr. Cake Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver! 
    Pinkie Pie  Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony! 

     
    Apple Bloom Hiya, Pinkie Pie! 
    Sweetie Belle Heard any good gossip today? 
    Scootaloo Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news. 
    Pinkie Pie Nope! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ugh! Fluttershy, what a surprise! I mean, not a surprise!  
    Fluttershy You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit. 
    Pinkie Pie Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh. 
    Fluttershy You know, maybe some baby carrots... 
    Pinkie Pie  What did you say?! 
    Fluttershy Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite. 
    Pinkie Pie Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter andâ€” Albino squirrel! 
    Fluttershy Where? Is it Albert? 
    Pinkie Pie It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary! 
     

     
     
     
     
     

    Pinkie Pie It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just one little pony the surprise? 
    Rarity  The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever! 
    Pinkie Pie You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I can't tell anypony at all!  Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault. 

    Pinkie Pie  Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wow, great idea! I'm starving too!  What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises today! And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately... 

     
    Sweetie Belle Ooh! I want a flamingo! 
     
    Apple Bloom I want a goldfish! 
     
    Scootaloo Surprise me! 
     
     
    Scootaloo Is that a... baby bottle? 
    Pinkie Pie  No! It's a... a... puppy! Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha! Eh... 
    Scootaloo Are you sure? Because it looks like aâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Next! 
    Featherweight Uh, a baby pony, please! Uh, unless of course that would be a royal pain... 
    Pinkie Pie Interesting choice of words, Featherweight. 
    Featherweight Was it? 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know. Was it? 
    Featherweight Uh, maybe you'd better just make me a giraffe. 

     
    Mayor Mare My, your friends weren't kidding when they said you had a great filing system, Pinkie! You are Ponyville's best kept secret! 
    Pinkie Pie No, I'm not! 
    Mayor Mare  Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Noooooo... 
    Mayor Mare  A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about? 
    Pinkie Pie Nope! 
    Mayor Mare  Me neither... 

     
    "Wooden Legs"  That's just what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie You're welcome! 
    "Wooden Legs" Oh, by the way, can you help spread the word about the big crib sale I'm having? 
    Pinkie Pie  "Treat your foal like... royalty"?! 
     
    "Wooden Legs"  Pretty good slogan, huh? I came up with it all by myself! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    "Wooden Legs" Oh. I thought it was clever. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled. 
    Pinkie Pie Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon! 
    Applejack Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday. 
    Pinkie Pie Whaaaaaaaaaat?!  another whole day?! I don't know if I can! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy We're here to listen. 
    Applejack Well, go on then, sugarcube. 
    Rarity We're not going to judge you, darling. 
    Spike You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Come on. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whatever it is, you can tell us! We're best friends!  Friends! Friends! Friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Tell! 
    Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle  Tell! Tell! 
    Main cast sans Pinkie Pie Friends! Friends! Friends! Tell! Tell! Tell! 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, okay, you win!  Shining Armor and Cadance are gonna have aâ€” 
    Shining Armor An awesome weekend with the best little sister in all of Equestria! 
    Princess Cadance  Hi, everypony. 
    Pinkie Pie  

    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor, Cadance! You're early! I thought something had come up and you weren't gonna make it until Saturday! 
    Princess Cadance So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until next week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned! 
    Shining Armor Surprise! 
    Princess Cadance It's wonderful to see you all again! 
    Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Applejack Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm so glad you're here! I have a big surprise for you! 
    Shining Armor Oh, yeah? 

    Main cast sans Pinkie Pie and Princess Cadance  
    Shining Armor  Lucky we came when we did, huh? I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake? Hey, I'm impressed you've been able to keep our secret this long! 
    Pinkie Pie So you're gonna tell Twilight now?! 
     
    Main cast sans Pinkie Pie and Princess Cadance  
    Shining Armor  You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise. 
    Pinkie Pie It'd better be. 

    Applejack So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise? 
    Twilight Sparkle Didn't you see him? He couldn't stop raving about it! 

    Shining Armor  

    Rainbow Dash Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us?  I'm starving! 
    Twilight Sparkle In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first! 
    Pinkie Pie  They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon... 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Pinkie Pie Nothiiiiiiing! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual. 
    Rainbow Dash Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly right now! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's this?  
    Rarity What does it say? 
    Twilight Sparkle A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a big prize, like a new book, or several new books, orâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie We get the picture! You like books! 
    Applejack So what's the first clue? 
    Rainbow Dash I hope it's something about eating lunch! 
    Pinkie Pie  "You've got a scroll, you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their week? A piece of paper will continue this caper." 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got it! "Where the young ones spend their week." 
    Applejack I'm not quite followin'. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse! 
    Pinkie Pie Good enough for me! Now where's the next clue?  
    Featherweight Extra, extra! Get your Ponyville news! Read it in the paper! Extra, extra!  
    Twilight Sparkle "A piece of paper will continue this caper."  It's in the Foal Free Press! 
     
    Rarity Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report! Why, it's stunning! 
    Applejack Uh, didn't you make that, Rarity? 
    Rarity Yes, what is your point? 
    Pinkie Pie Focus, everypony! 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, there's really no time limit on these scavenger hunts, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Aha! There!  
    Twilight Sparkle  "Though this hall is rather small, in it you'll find files of all kinds. Take a look on the back of the birth certificate of Applejack." 
    Applejack I don't like where this is goin'. 

     
     
    Mayor Mare Baby! A royal baâ€”! 
    Pinkie Pie A-hem? 
    Twilight Sparkle Does anypony know where the birth certificates are kept? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right! 
    Fluttershy Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall. 
    Pinkie Pie There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know! 

     
    Fluttershy Oh, you're so cute. 
    Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle  "This next place is where you can buy a table or chair, or some comfy beds to rest little heads"? 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Ugh, really? None of you?  It's obviously the furniture store! Go in, go in, go in! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know... 
    Pinkie Pie Daagh, fine! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Wow, you're scary good at this, Pinkie Pie. 
    Pinkie Pie  "It seems we've saved the best for last. We hope that you have had a blast. Now it's time to take a break where you can get a slice of cake!" 
    Main cast sans Pinkie Pie Sugarcube Corner! 
    Pinkie Pie  That was an easy one. 

     
    Shining Armor Surprise! Twily, did you like the scavenger hunt? 
    Twilight Sparkle It was perfect! Just like old times, except even better because this time I got to share it with my best friends! There's just one thing missing, isn't there? 
    Shining Armor What's that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Mmmm, the book prize at the end! 
    Shining Armor  There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. I don't understand. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Princess Cadance All the places we sent you today had something in common. 
    Twilight Sparkle First we went to the schoolhouse... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle And then we read the Foal Free Press... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib. 
    Pound and Pumpkin Cake  
    Twilight Sparkle Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib...  Can it be? Are you two...?! 
    Princess Cadance and Shining Armor We're having a baby! 
    Pinkie Pie A baby, Twilight! It's a baby! Woo-hoo! 
    Twilight Sparkle You mean... I'm going to be an aunt?! This is the best prize ever! 
    Princess Cadance and Shining Armor  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I love you guys! And I can't wait to meet your little foal! 
    Shining Armor Neither can we. 
     
    Pinkie Pie I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it!  Go, Pinkie. 

     
    Princess Cadance  You did it, Pinkie Pie! You kept it a surprise! Thank you! Was it much trouble? 
    Pinkie Pie Piece of cake!  

     

Hearthbreakers

     
    Pinkie Pie Happy Hearth's Warming Eve! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
    Applejack Shucks, Twilight! Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here. 
    Twilight Sparkle We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us. 
    Applejack Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together. 
    Pinkie Pie Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of. Now multiply that times infinity! Whoo! It's gonna be great! 
     
    Applejack That's us. See you later! 
    Spike Now can we open presents? 
    Applejack But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow. 
    Twilight Sparkle When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before! 
    Spike It's kinda like our tradition! 
    Applejack That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it? 
    Pinkie Pie No sirree! 
    Twilight Sparkle To each their own, I suppose. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Agh! Gotta go, bye! 
    Spike  
     
    Spike Just what I always wanted! A book... 

     

     
    Porter Pony Chancellor Puddinghead puddings! How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone? 
    Applejack It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof! 
    Pinkie Pie Apples and Pies together again for the first time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I just confused myself. 
    Applejack Friends or family, this here's about togetherness. 
    Apple Bloom  Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents! 
    Applejack Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right? 
    Apple Bloom Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice. 
    Granny Smith  
    Applejack 'Fraid so!  A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends. 
    Pinkie Pie  I don't like you either! 
    Applejack But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away. 
    Pinkie Pie  Beat it, Windigos! 
    Applejack Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born. 
     
    Applejack Uh, what happened to the flag? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Apple Bloom Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow? 
    Applejack Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors. 
    Pinkie Pie We do that too! 
    Applejack Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night. 
    Pinkie Pie That's what our family does too! 
    Applejack And tomorrow, we open presents! 
    Pinkie Pie Ah! We do that too! 
    Apple Bloom Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way! 
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am. What about... "rooftastic"?  
    Applejack "Rooftastic"? 
    Pinkie Pie As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is! 
     
    Applejack What if our families don't like each other? 
    Pinkie Pie We are friends, Applejack, and after tonight, our families are gonna be friends too. Do you know what that means? Number of Apples times number of Pies is twenty four, minus my preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes five from twenty four is...  
    Maud Pie  I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday. 
    Applejack How'd you know that? 
    Maud Pie  Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock. 
    Granny Smith  Oh, she's good. 
    Pinkie Pie How's school going? 
    Maud Pie  If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum. 
    Pinkie Pie I missed you so much! 
    Apple family Mm-hmm. 

    Applejack This place looks amazin'! 
    Pinkie Pie Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony! 
    Igneous Rock Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith. I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie. 
    Cloudy Quartz Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz. 
    Igneous Rock May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring. 
    Granny Smith Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like. Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? "Iggy"? And I'm just gonna call you "Big Mama Q"! 
    Limestone Pie Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running. Cross me andâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine! 
    Limestone Pie Or Holder's Boulder! 
    Pinkie Pie  Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now? 
    Applejack And you must beâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming! 
     
    Marble Pie Mm-hmm. 
    Applejack  Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her. 
    Apple Bloom  
    Pinkie Pie  Attention! 
    Limestone Pie What'd I say about the boulder?! 
    Pinkie Pie I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner! 
     
    Applejack  So far, so good, cousin! 
    Pinkie Pie Hee-hee! 

     
    Apple Bloom Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner. 
    Granny Smith I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself! 
    Apple Bloom I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours? 
    Applejack Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert â€“ it's me! 
     
     
    Applejack What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie? 
    Granny Smith Uh, what about six-layer bean dip? 
    Maud Pie  We have rock soup. 
    Pinkie Pie Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right? 
     
    Applejack Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony? 
    Big McIntosh and Granny Smith  
    Applejack  

    Pinkie Pie  Is everything all right, Applejack? 
    Applejack O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle. Tune me up and let's get back to dinner.  
    Pinkie Pie More rock, please! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls! 
    Applejack Now that's somethin' I know all about! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll? 
    Applejack Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll? 
    Pinkie Pie Don't be silly, silly! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie? 
     
    Marble Pie Mm-hmm. 
     
    Apple Bloom Our dolls are... rocks? 
     
     
    Applejack Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family? 
    Pinkie Pie Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission! 
    Applejack The what findin' what now? 

    Pinkie Pie Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins! 
    Applejack So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'? 
    Pinkie Pie As everypony knowsâ€” 
    Limestone Pie Stay off Holder's Boulder! 
    Pinkie Pie Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day. 
    Other ponies  
    Pinkie Pie But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder? 
    Applejack You mean on the flagpole? 
    Pinkie Pie No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony? 
    Applejack Traditionally, it's the youngestâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie  On your marks, get set, go! 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on? 
    Pinkie Pie I'll explain on the way! 
    Applejack  

    Applejack I still don't understand. 
    Pinkie Pie Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag! 
    Applejack It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, how else would we do it? 
    Applejack I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time. 

    Marble Pie Mm-hmm. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Marble Pie Mm-hmm. 
    Big McIntosh Eeeeeeeeeyup. 

    Granny Smith So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller? 
    Cloudy Quartz We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight. 
    Igneous Rock The choosing stone decreed, "Thou shalt love one another." And lo, it was so. 
    Granny Smith Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks? 
    Igneous Rock Indeed so. 
    Cloudy Quartz  Mmm. 

    Apple Bloom What does the rock look like? 
    Maud Pie  It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly. 
    Apple Bloom Oh. 
    Maud Pie  Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock? 
    Apple Bloom I had a dream once I was an apple. 
    Maud Pie  We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things. 

    Pinkie Pie Found it, found it, found it! 
    Applejack A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents! 
    Applejack Y'all hide your presents? 
    Pinkie Pie Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one. 
    Applejack So nopony gets presents? 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, not usually. 
    Applejack So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way. 
    Applejack Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...? 
    Pinkie Pie Picturing it... Loving it...! 

    Pinkie Pie Goodnight, everypony! 
    Applejack Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!  We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'! 
    Granny Smith Is that really what she said? 
    Applejack Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant. 
    Apple Bloom These are their traditions. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack  I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be. 

     
    Pinkie Pie Hearth's Warming! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth'sâ€”  
    Igneous Rock Oh, my. Oh, my. 
    Limestone Pie What. Happened. To. My. Farm! 
    Applejack It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em! 
    Pinkie Pie ...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony? 
    Igneous Rock Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I wanna be one big family! 
    Limestone Pie But what about what we usually do?! 
    Pinkie Pie I, um, well, I-I don't know!  Don't make me choose! 
    Applejack I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see! 
    Maud Pie Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line. 
     
    Limestone Pie Nooooooooooooooo! 
     
    Applejack Oh, boy. 

     
    Pinkie Pie You didn't have to ask them to leave! 
    Limestone Pie They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family! 
    Pinkie Pie This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony! 
    Limestone Pie Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take me ages to get this rock farm back on track! And how are we gonna lift Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault! 
    Pinkie Pie Then it's my fault too... 

     
    Granny Smith Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space. 
    Apple Bloom I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever. 
    Granny Smith Eh, has anypony seen Applejack? 

    Applejack  I really cracked the corn this time. 
    Pinkie Pie  I really popped the piÃ±ata this time. 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie  What are you doing here? 
    Applejack What are you doin' here? 
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  Aww. 
    Applejack I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop. 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry. 
    Applejack I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not. 
    Pinkie Pie Don't say that! 
     
    Applejack I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch. 
    Pinkie Pie  H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming. 
    Applejack  You too. 

     
    Granny Smith You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important?  Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone â€“ he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It always brought them good luck. 
    Applejack Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em! 
     
    Applejack  To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever. 
    Apple Bloom You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever! 
    Applejack  Stop the train! 

    Pie family  
    Pinkie Pie  Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh! 
    Maud Pie  I'm pushing as hard as I can too. 
    Pie family  
    Limestone Pie Rrrgh, it's hopeless! 
    Applejack Need a little help? 
    Pinkie Pie  Apples! 
    Limestone Pie What do you want?! 
    Applejack I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all. 
     
    Limestone Pie Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge. 
    Apple family and Pie family  
    Pinkie Pie I think we've just invented our first combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry!  I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming! 
    Apple family and Pie family  

    Apple Bloom  
    Pinkie Pie Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac? 
    Marble Pie Mm-hmm! 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup. 
    Granny Smith Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'. 
    Igneous Rock 'Yee-haw'. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Happy Hearth's Warming! 
    Applejack Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie. 
    Apple Bloom Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote! 
    Apple family and Pie family  
    Maud Pie  Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day. As good as mica or clay. 

     

Scare Master

     
     
    Fluttershy Fuzzy Legs, do you think you could secure those windows? 
     
     
    Fluttershy And you'll alert me if anything scary comes close to the cottage? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, who am I kidding? When something scary comes close to the cottage! Please tell me my hiding place is ready. 
    Harry  
    Fluttershy Oh, look, you've filled it with everything I need to survive this awful night. Thank you. Thank you all! Now I don't have to step a hoof outside until this whole thing is over. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! You don't have any carrots? Do we have any other fresh veggies you may enjoy? 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Or maybe some hay? But that means I'll need to go out... on Nightmare Night?! 
     
     

     

     
     
    Twinkleshine and Amethyst Star  
    Fluttershy  
    Foals  Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite! 
    Fluttershy  
    Foals  Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite! 
    Granny Smith Fluttershy? What're you doin' out and about? It's Nightmare Night, remember? 
    Fluttershy How could I forget? Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you? I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot. 
    Granny Smith We need it for the Apple Family Haunted Maze.  The scariest maze that there ever was. Who knows what lurks inside? 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm sure I don't. 
    Granny Smith Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at ya? 
    Fluttershy I don't know. Is it? 
    Granny Smith And what's that crunchin' sound beneath yer hooves? Maybe it's the bones of ponies that didn't make it out alive! 
    Fluttershy B-B-B-B-Bones?! 
    Granny Smith And are those peeled grapes or a thousand slimy eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave? 
    Fluttershy Please tell me they're grapes! 
    Granny Smith Oh, I'll never tell.  
     
    Fluttershy  
    Granny Smith Huh. I wonder what got stuck in her craw. 

     
     
    Fluttershy Twilight? Hello?  
    Spike You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done. 
    Fluttershy That's okay. I'll take your word for it. 
    Spike  Hey, wait a minute! It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage! Does this mean what I think it means? 
    Fluttershy That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him? 
    Spike Oh. I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight. 
    Fluttershy Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't. 
    Spike Technically speaking, you already are out right now. 
    Fluttershy Oh. I guess that is true. 
    Spike So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited. 
    Fluttershy You think so? 
    Spike You would make them so happy if you joined in. They wouldn't believe their eyes! Come on, Fluttershy, what do you say? 
     

    Pinkie Pie And then it got very, very quiet and suddenly they realized the balloons had never been inflated! 
    All but Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Did I ever tell you about the night that the mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes? 
    Rainbow Dash What happened? 
    Rarity I just told you, darling. A mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Hi, everypony. 
    All but Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, what are you doing here? Is everything okay? 
    Fluttershy Everything is fine. In fact, it's more than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities. 
    Rainbow Dash  Seriously? You? Out? Tonight? 
    Fluttershy Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it. 
    Applejack And we'd have missed out on how great you sound. 
    Rarity Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night? Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages! 
    Pinkie Pie You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us! 
    Applejack Don't forget the best part. Goin' through my family's corn maze! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Oh, right. The maze. 
    Applejack Uh, only if you're up for it. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I am! I am ready to take on Nightmare Night! 
    All but Fluttershy  
    Fluttershy  

    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Rarity Mummy? No. Headless pony? No. Vampire fruit bat? Ugh, definitely no. You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary. 
     
    Rarity Ooh! Yes. This one will look gorgeous on you. Period costumes are all the rage this year. What? No good? 
    Fluttershy What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip! 
    Rarity Oh. I never... considered that. Never fear! 
     
    Rarity  Ooh, now this is a real stunner! I call it "Masquerade"! Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask! 
    Fluttershy A mask? 
    Rarity No? 
    Fluttershy They can just be so difficult to see out of. 
    Rarity Yes, but this one has eyeholes. 
    Fluttershy W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me? 
    Rarity I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured. It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable. 
    Fluttershy What if I just wear the dress? 
    Rarity Oh, sure, dear. That's... fine.  Oh, my! Look at all of you! My costumes fit you to a T! 
    Applejack Hoo-wee, we're gonna have the best time! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Fluttershy, where's your costume? 
    Fluttershy I'm wearing it. 
    Pinkie Pie  I get it! You're a robber escaping into the night! You're a ninja escaping into the night! You're black licorice escaping into the night! 
    Fluttershy Close. I'm going to a masquerade ball. Without the mask. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, that's great! Isn't it great? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah. 
    Pinkie Pie So creative. 
    Applejack Great costume. 

    Pinkie Pie I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it. 
    All but Rainbow Dash Round and round and round you go, where you stop nopony knows! 
    Pinkie Pie Okay... go! 
    Rainbow Dash  Good luck beating that, Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself. 
    Rarity That's fine, darling. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. 
    Twilight Sparkle We're just glad you're here. 
    Pinkie Pie We don't have to finish that game. I have another one I know you'll love! Bobbing for apples! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy, what's wrong? 
    Fluttershy It's just that, um... What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Time for candy! 
    Fluttershy It is? 
    Pinkie Pie I made candy bags. Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies! 
    Rainbow Dash Ha! Awesome! 
    Pinkie Pie Here. Take it. Take it! What are you waiting for? 
    Fluttershy Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I? 
    Pinkie Pie You're not taking out all of the fun. 
    Rainbow Dash Just, like, ninety perâ€” 
     
    Rainbow Dash ...Some of it. 
    Fluttershy I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me. 
    Twilight Sparkle Unless... you were the one doing the scaring! 
    Rainbow Dash Her scaring us?  Oh. You're being serious. 
    Twilight Sparkle The thing you hate is being scared, but if you're the one doing the scaring, then... 
    Fluttershy Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night! 
    Twilight Sparkle So you like that idea? 
    Fluttershy I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it! 
    Pinkie Pie Really? Oh, this is so exciting! 
    Fluttershy  Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon! 

     
     
    Fluttershy  Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party! 
    Rainbow Dash Did she just say "tea party"? 
    Twilight Sparkle It sounds like it's a scary tea party? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy  Have a seat. Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There is none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on! 
    Rarity Why would I do that? 
    Fluttershy  You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches! 
    Pinkie Pie Huh? I can't. There's nopony there. 
    Fluttershy  That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup. 
    Pinkie Pie What? 
    Fluttershy  A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, what are those? 
    Fluttershy  Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting? 
    Rarity It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature. 
    Twilight Sparkle It was really creative, though. I never would have thought of... all this. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me. 
    Rarity Oh, no. We couldn't possibly. 
    Fluttershy You have to. This is the night you look forward to all year. 
    Pinkie Pie We could... stay here? 
    Fluttershy It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend every Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine. 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, it's funny. I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there. 
    Applejack She definitely tried her hardest. 
     
    Fluttershy I did try my hardest. 
    Angel  
    Fluttershy Or... maybe not. I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that? 
    Angel  

    Applejack Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all! Let's go! 
    Spike Oh, yeah! I can't believe we're finally doin' this! 
     
    All  
    Rainbow Dash It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this! 
     
    All  
    Big McIntosh Boooo... Eeyup. 
    All  
     
    Rarity What. Is. That. Sound? 
    Pinkie Pie It looks like... bones! 
    All  
    Rainbow Dash Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me. 
    Applejack Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya? 
    Rarity and Spike Gah! 
    All  
    Pinkie Pie Whoo! 
     
    Applejack Agh! What was that? 
    Spike Don't you know? 
    Applejack Uh, o-of course I do. It was, uh... 
     
     
    All  
     
    Rarity  Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress. 
     
    Applejack  
    All  
     
    All  
    Rarity What is this? Is it a tunnel? Where does it lead?! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Which way are we supposed to go now?! 
    Applejack Uh, I don't know! I don't know what's goin' on! 
    Rainbow Dash  What do you mean? Didn't you help plan this? 
     
    Applejack Whew. There's Granny Smith. Not that I was ever scared, 'cause I wasn't. I'm a pretty good actress when I wanna be. Granny?  
    All  
     
    Spike Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?! 
    Applejack Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too! I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this. 
    Granny Smith  
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Applejack  That's what we were supposed to do! I don't know why we're down here! This is really scarin' me now! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Monster  
    Pinkie Pie How did that get down here?! 
    Monster  
    Rainbow Dash RUUUUUUUUUN! 
    Pinkie Pie and Spike  
    Pinkie Pie I can't see! 
    Rainbow Dash I can barely move! 
    All  
    Rainbow Dash It's like glue! 
    All  
    Monster  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Monster  
    All  
    Flutterbat  
    All  
    Fluttershy Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me? 
    Applejack Fluttershy? 
    Rainbow Dash It was you the whole time?! 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe it! 
    Rarity That... was... 
    Pinkie Pie THE BEST THING EVER!  
    Rainbow Dash It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of! 
    Applejack You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze! 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you do all this?! 
    Fluttershy After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends. 
    Rainbow Dash You came up with all of this? 
    Fluttershy I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster. 
    Harry  
    Twilight Sparkle Wow! That was inspired! 
    Pinkie Pie You have to do this every year! 
    Applejack Uh-huh! 
    Rarity Absolutely! 
    Twilight Sparkle Every year! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! 
    Fluttershy We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to. 
    Pinkie Pie You don't?! 
    Rarity But you've done it. You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together. 
    Fluttershy Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea. 
    Pinkie Pie Spoooooooooky tea? 
    Fluttershy No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Then we are, too. 
    Harry  
     

    Fluttershy  I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night. 

     

What About Discord?

    Spike  Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but that was because we needed to! This is just because I want to! I call it my "book-sort-cation"! Three uninterrupted days of reorganizing books. Can you think of anything more relaxing? 
    Spike Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths... You weren't really looking for an answer, were you? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second! 
    Spike  Whoa. That much? 
    Twilight Sparkle Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize! 
    Owlowiscious  
    Twilight Sparkle Best long weekend ever! I'm sure we can make some time for a claw massage and a back rub too. 
    Spike Yes! Best long weekend ever! 

     

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Whoa! That strange yellow orb in the sky! What is that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, alright, so it's been a little while since we've seen the sun. 
    Spike A little while? We've been in that library for three straight days! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but they were three very productive days! Even if you did take that two-hour claw massage break. 
    Spike Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not like we missed anything. 
     
    Rainbow Dash and Discord Hello, Twilight! Hi, Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, Rainbow Dash. Good to see you, Discord. 
    Spike Did you rehearse before you found us? 
    Rainbow Dash and Discord What makes you think we practiced? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Rainbow Dash. What's going on here? 
    Rainbow Dash  Sorry. Me and Discord are just messin' around. Like we do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Since when? 
    Discord Oh, Twilight. We simply had a momentous time together these past three days. You could say it was... "hiss-terical"!  
    Rainbow Dash  Sneaky snake! 
    Discord  Just snaking around! 
    Rainbow Dash Good one, Discord!  
    Twilight Sparkle It is? 
    Rainbow Dash Kind of an inside joke from this weekend. You wouldn't really get it unless you were there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Okay. 
    Rainbow Dash Cool. Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight! 
    Discord  Catch you later, Twilight. 
     
     

    Twilight Sparkle That was strange, right? Since when have Rainbow Dash and Discord had inside jokes? 
    Spike Since sometime in the last three days, I guess. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hey! Nopony made you join me on my book-sort-cation. 
    Spike I'm jokin', I'm jokin'! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity? 
    Rarity  Twilight! You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical! All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion! 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks! It was very relaxing. And we were able to clear a shelf for those old-fashioned books you wanted to donate. 
    Rarity Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling. They're vintage, and they're over there! I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou! 
    Spike Oh, I love her! 
    Rarity Him. 
    Spike  Both. 
    Discord Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky? 
    Twilight Sparkle Weren't you just withâ€” 
    Fluttershy Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike! How was your book-sort-cation? 
    Twilight Sparkle It was good! 
    Fluttershy  Orange you glad you did it? 
    Fluttershy, Rarity, and Discord  
    Rarity  
    Fluttershy Oh, please. You'll make me blush. 
    Discord You do seem to be turning a shade of...  orange! 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Rarity Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain... 
    Discord Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest. 
    Spike  "Dearest"? 
    Discord  Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there. 
    Fluttershy We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing. We know how important it is to you. 
    Discord And I'm sure it was much more important than the fun that we had.  
    Twilight Sparkle I appreciate that... Speaking of books, I should get these on the shelves. 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  

    Twilight Sparkle Hmm. Rainbow Dash bonding with Discord, Rarity finding something he did genuinely funny... Must've been some weekend. 
    Spike Somepony sorry she missed it? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course not. 
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle What's got you two in hysterics? 
    Discord  Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever! 
    Twilight Sparkle  He's everywhere today, isn't he? 
    Discord Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said,  "Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!" 
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Eh, I don't get it. 
    Pinkie Pie  It was hilarious! I wish we'd taken a picture for you! 
    Discord Oh, well, this should do! 
     
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle I guess that's funny? 
    Discord Well, seems this has become quite the... sticky situation!  
    Applejack and Pinkie Pie  
    Pinkie Pie  Sticky situation! 
    Applejack Aw, shucks, Twilight. We haven't even asked how your weekend went. 
    Twilight Sparkle It was fine! 
    Discord And yet you look so glum. Does somepony need a huggy-wuggy?  
     
    Twilight Sparkle I am not glum. I'm glad! I'm glad you all had such a good time together. Having inside jokes can really create a lasting bond between friends. 
    Discord I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle. 
    Applejack Heh. Oh, don't you worry about Twilight. Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books. Again. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure I had just as much fun as the rest of you. 

    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe I missed out on all that bonding! 
    Spike  I knew it! You are jealous! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, I'm the Princess of Friendship. I don't get jealous. I'm sorry I missed out because sharing that experience would've helped me with my Princess of Friendship duties! 
    Spike  Come again? 
    Twilight Sparkle If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship! 
    Spike Hm. I guess so. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better! 

    Twilight Sparkle Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important. 
    Pinkie Pie I love important! 
    Twilight Sparkle I want to know how these funny moments you shared came to pass. I can use this data to help advance friendships all over Equestria. 
    Applejack Well, I like the sound of that! 
    Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Perfect. Let's start with the snake. 
    Rainbow Dash and Discord  
    Rainbow Dash I don't know if I can get it out! It's too funny! 
    Discord Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden... 
     
    Applejack Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom. 
    Discord Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake! 
    Fluttershy I think it was a garden hose. 
    Rainbow Dash It was a hose snake. Super deadly. 
    Applejack I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake. 
    Pinkie Pie Point is, we galloped away. 
    Rainbow Dash And it chased after us! 
    Twilight Sparkle The hose? A snake? A stick? 
    Rainbow Dash A snake! 
    Fluttershy A hose! 
    Applejack A stick! 
    Discord We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious? 
    Fluttershy I guess you had to be there. 
    Twilight Sparkle I do need to be there. 
    Rarity But you weren't! And it's already happened! Ooh, are you suggesting... 
    Pinkie Pie Time travel?! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Absolutely not! Time travel is not something to be messed with. We simply need to recreate everything that led to these jokes. 
    Discord Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on? 

    Twilight Sparkle Are you sure it was this table? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, does it really matter? 
    Twilight Sparkle When it comes to science, everything matters. One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. 
    Discord Ohhhhhh... it was this table here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened? 
    Rarity Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu. Itâ€” 
    Discord I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes? 
    Discord The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question. 
    Twilight Sparkle ...Really? 
    Rarity He's right! The tablecloth was red! I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus. 
    Applejack I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it? 
    Discord Oh, most definitely. 
     
    Fluttershy Ooh. 
    Pinkie Pie Wowee! 
    Discord One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all? 
    Fluttershy Um, I've noticed a couple of things. 
    Pinkie Pie Me too! 
    Discord Excellent! 
     

    Discord A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right! 
    Pinkie Pie The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Perfect! 

     
    Discord No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! GarÃ§on! GarÃ§on, over here! 

     
    Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle  
    Discord No? Nothing? 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting? 
    Discord Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter. 
    Mane cast sans Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, Twilight. If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it. 
    Twilight Sparkle But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria! 
     
    Discord Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected.  Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Discord You! 
    Twilight Sparkle Me? 
    Discord You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there. 
    Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle Hmmm. 
    Pinkie Pie He makes a good point. 
    Discord It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience. 
    Pinkie Pie He makes another good point! 
    Rarity Oh, don't worry, darling. I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of  frivolity we had with Discord while you were away. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, and I'll bet they'll be just as hissssss-terical!  
    Discord  
    Fluttershy  Absolutely. 

    Twilight Sparkle I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike! 
    Spike  Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous! 
    Twilight Sparkle Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why they find it funny. Why they think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense! 
    Spike Some things just can't be explained. 
    Twilight Sparkle Our friends think something great happened to them while I was away, but no. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?! 
    Spike Spell? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose! 

    Twilight Sparkle Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic? 
     
    Zecora In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell? 
    Twilight Sparkle They're having fun with Discord, that's why! 
    Zecora Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block? 
    Twilight Sparkle Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. I know funny. 
    Zecora Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell. 
    Spike Wait. If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron? 
    Zecora It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show. 

    Applejack  I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early. 
    Rarity Another map adventure, perhaps? 
    Pinkie Pie Nope, no glowing tushies here! 
    Fluttershy Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure. Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, gang! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, you look excited! 
    Twilight Sparkle I am excited! We're gonna have fun today! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you! 
    Applejack A what now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you thought you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be constantly laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it. 
     
    Rainbow Dash You're kidding. 
    Rarity Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord. As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun! 
    Applejack What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power! 
    Fluttershy Twilight, how could you say such a thing?! I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah! And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something! What do you take us for? 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah!  take us for?! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Dee-licious! Got any more, Twilight? 
     
    Discord Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle "The gang"? 
    Discord Yeah! The peanut-butter-hoof gang!  
    Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie  It's still funny! 
    Applejack  So much for that whole "spell" theory. 
    Discord and main cast sans Twilight Sparkle  
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. But it's still not funny! 
    Rainbow Dash It's funny if you were there. 
    Twilight Sparkle But I wasn't there! I wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, butâ€”!  I wasn't there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me... 
    Spike Jealous? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous. 
    Applejack Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it. 
    Fluttershy We're sorry if we made you feel left out. 
    Twilight Sparkle You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me. 
    Rarity And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it. You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go. 
    Rainbow Dash And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around. 
     
    Discord Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend. 
    Twilight Sparkle They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me? 
    Discord Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible. 
    Pinkie Pie You don't look like you feel terrible. 
    Discord Better? 
    Applejack Wait a minute. You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you? 
    Discord Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident. 
     
    Discord Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here â€“ that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed? 
     
    Discord I said, Orange you glad I've changed? 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Discord Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend! 
     
    Discord No? Nothing? Really? I thought you'd find this hisss-terical! 
     
    Rarity ...Yes, no. Discord, I think these jokes have run their course. 
    Pinkie Pie Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell! 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell? 
    Main cast sans Twilight Sparkle  
    Discord W-W-What's so funny? 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you? 
    Main cast  
    Discord I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?! 
     
    Discord I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that... 
    Spike Sorry, buddy. Guess you had to be there. 
     
     
    Main cast and Discord  

     

The Hooffields and McColts

    Fluttershy Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves? Hooray! I love Furry Friends Book Club! Now, let's discuss the theme of nature as it applies to Hoofcliff's love. 
     
    Fluttershy Did somepony leave a light on? Oh, it's me. Oh! It's me! 
     
    Fluttershy We'll continue this discussion when I get back! 
     
    Animals  

     

     
    Twilight Sparkle You're here! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Isn't this exciting?! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh! You were called, too! Thank goodness. I feel so much better going with a friend. 
    Twilight Sparkle I was about to come and get you, but then I got distracted. 
     
    Fluttershy Oh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ever since the map called us, I've been doing a ton of research. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Testing out potential friendship problems. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Diversifying my solution portfolio. 
    Fluttershy Ever since the map called us? But that happened five minutes ago. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know! But I wanna be one hundred percent prepared! I mean, I'm the Princess of Friendship. How would it look if I couldn't solve a friendship problem? 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm so lucky I'm being sent with you. Speaking of which, where are we going? 
    Twilight Sparkle The Smokey Mountains! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I've never been there before. 
    Twilight Sparkle Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks. 
    Fluttershy That's gorgeous. And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends! 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared. 
    Fluttershy You seem pretty prepared to me. Are those for us? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books. 
    Fluttershy You said "books" twice. 
    Twilight Sparkle There are a lot of books. 
    Fluttershy Ooh! 
    Twilight Sparkle What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be? 
    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Do you think it'll be a problem about lying? 
    Fluttershy  I'm sure we'll find out when we get there. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right. 

    Twilight Sparkle Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out? 

    Twilight Sparkle Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to? 
    Fluttershy  We'll know very, very soon. Since we're almost there. 

    Fluttershy  
    Twilight Sparkle Here. Lemme get that. 
    Fluttershy  Thank you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry I've been a little skiddly-bopty-boo. I just can't believe this is finally happening! 
     
    Fluttershy Whoa! 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! What in Equestria is happening? 
     
    Fluttershy It's nothing like your book said it would be! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, boy. I'm feeling very unprepared. Where do we even start? 
     
    Fluttershy Maybe by figuring out where the flying pumpkins are coming from? 

    Ma Hooffield Ready... Aim... Fire! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Um, hi. Hello. Excuse us, but what are you doing? 
    Ma Hooffield We're pumpkinin' our neighbors! 
    Fluttershy Yes, but, um, why are you... "pumpkining" your neighbors? 
    Ma Hooffield Well, because the McColts are just plain rotten. Hey, wait a tick. Who are you two?! You're not spies for the McColts, are ya? 
    Twilight Sparkle I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. And I am here to solve your friendship problem. 
    Fluttershy I'm Fluttershy, and... um... I'm here, too. 
    Ma Hooffield Ma Hooffield. Pleased to meet ya, but you're wastin' your time. We don't have a friendship problem. We have... a McColt problem. 
    "Buzzard Hooffield" And there's absolutely no friendship there. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, maybe there could be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad. 
    Ma Hooffield Oh, they done so many things. Why, just today, they shot pebbles at our farmhouse an' wrecked it. See, we're not very good at buildin', so all it took was a little pebble. But still! 
    Mice  
    Fluttershy Oh, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale. 
    Fluttershy Good plan.  That's why she's the princess. 
    Twilight Sparkle In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining? 
    Ma Hooffield Oh, alright. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy. 

     
    "Steel Bolts" State your business! 
    "Rosy Riveter" Don't even bother. They're probably spies for the Hooffields. 
    "Steel Bolts" Hey, wait! You're an Alicorn! I thought just the three princesses were Alicorns. 
    Twilight Sparkle There are four Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. 
    Fluttershy And I'm Fluttershy. 
    "Steel Bolts" We have a new princess? When did that happen? A-A-And how did the Hooffields come by a princess spy? 
    Twilight Sparkle We are not spies!  Why does everypony assume we're spies? 
     
    Big Daddy McColt Because we don't get a lot of visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt. You caught us at a weird time. We're in the middle of a giant feud with our... Terrible neighbors! 
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, actually, that's why we're here â€“ to solve your problem with the Hooffields. 
    Big Daddy McColt So you're here to help us get rid of 'em. 
    McColts  
    Twilight Sparkle No! That's not what I meant at all! 
    Big Daddy McColt Well, if you ain't fer us, you're agin' us. 

    Twilight Sparkle We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again. 
    Big Daddy McColt Well, that's gon' be hard. I don't believe we've ever been friends with the Hooffields! 
    Twilight Sparkle But you could be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse. 
    Big Daddy McColt Wait a hog-wogglin' minute! We only did that because the Hooffields pulled the pin out of our wagon wheel! 
     
    Big Daddy McColt A whole week's worth of food rollin' down the mountain. Us McColts are mighty fine builders, but we don't know the first thing about farmin'. 
    McColts  
    Big Daddy McColt We have to travel a ways away to buy our food. Now, we'll be stuck eatin' the pumpkins the Hooffields launched at us. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin soup, pumpkin  quesadillas, pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese, pumpkin pie, pumpkin frittatas... Actually, that all sounds pretty good. But it'll get old! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other? 
    Big Daddy McColt What?! No! They'd sooner launch their dinners at us than listen to us. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party. 

    Twilight Sparkle  There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy I'd love to. But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, yeah. They should be glowing any minute now... 
     
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Or not. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So much for potential friendship solution number twenty-eight. 
    Fluttershy I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now. 

    Ma Hooffield One at a time, Greenhoof. If you smoosh them tomaters in the slingshot, they won't break on the McColts. 
    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing? I asked you to stop fighting. 
    Ma Hooffield Oh, is that what you were hollerin' about? We thought the McColts rubbed ya the wrong way. So we tomatered them for ya. My mistake.  Stop the tomater slingshots! 
     
    Ma Hooffield Reload the tomater slingshots! We're gonna paint their mountaintop red! 
    Fluttershy Bleh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, that didn't work. I was so sure it would. 
     
    Fluttershy  It was a good plan. We need to think of another one. And soon. This fight is really affecting the animals around here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not to worry. I'll just, uh... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle ...find the root of the problem and work from there. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pardon us, Ma, but do you remember what started this whole feud in the first place? 
    Ma Hooffield They know what they did. 

    Big Daddy McColt They know what they did! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm starting to think neither of you know what either of you have done. 
    Big Daddy McColt Sure, we do. Them Hooffields did us a grave injustice some time ago for some reason. 
    McColts Hear, hear! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, backup plan to the backup plan. Maybe we can find some common ground that you can bond over. What do you do when you're not fighting? 
    Big Daddy McColt That's easy. Gettin' ready to fight. 

    Fluttershy What do you hope to get out of fighting? 
    Ma Hooffield The satisfaction of winnin'! 

    Twilight Sparkle Of winning what? 
     
    Big Daddy McColt The fight, of course! To prove our family is the best! 

    Fluttershy The best at what? 
    Ma Hooffield Winnin'! Haven't you been listenin'?! 
    Twilight Sparkle So the only thing they have in common is that they both want to win a fight, and neither of them know what it's over. How can I end this feud if I don't know what it's about? 
    Fluttershy Ooh! Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's a good idea. And friendship solution number forty-eight. But we can move it up. 

    Twilight Sparkle I'm so glad you agreed to do this. This apology cake will go a long way to making amends between you two. Which part of my argument changed your mind? The part where I said the benefits of friendship outweigh the cost of war, or the part where I said forgiveness is an investment in happiness? 
    Ma Hooffield Yeah, yeah. All of it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wait. Are you even listening to me? 
    "Steel Bolts" Who goes there?! 
    Ma Hooffield It's Ma Hooffield. 
    "Steel Bolts" Hooffield alert! Arm the cannons! 
    Ma Hooffield With an apology cake! 
    "Steel Bolts" Did you say "cake"? As in...  cake? 
    Ma Hooffield Consider it a gesture of goodwill from us to you. 
    McColt Guards  
    "Rosy Riveter" I haven't had cake in ages. 
    "Steel Bolts" Open the gates! 
     
    "Hacksaw McColt"  Oh, it's such a bee-utiful cake. 
    Twilight Sparkle Think of this as more than just a cake. It's the first step in the long road to forgiveness. 
    Fluttershy Nothing says "let's be friends" like a cake that says, "Let's be friends!"  I wrote that in icing on the top. 
     
    Hooffields For glory! Whoa! 
    Big Daddy McColt McColts! Assume Delta Force formation! 
    McColts Yah! 
     
    Ma Hooffield Ready... aim... fire! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ma Hooffield, you planted ponies in that cake?! 
    Ma Hooffield Yeah!  Wait. Were you serious about apologizin'? Why in Equestria would we do that? We didn't do anythin' wrong! 
    Big Daddy McColt What're you talkin' about?! You done so many things wrong! 
    Ma Hooffield Not as many as you! 
    Ma Hooffield and Big Daddy McColt  
     

     
    Fluttershy Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether... 
     
     
    Fluttershy Wah! Twilight? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Fluttershy Um, Twilight? We should probably get back there. I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know if we can do this at all. Even if I make things right, they're just gonna fight again. 
     
    Fluttershy Hey, little fellas. Oh, that's okay, you can come out. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle What was that? 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, you poor things! There isn't enough food here for you! Oh, brrr, and you're freezing! I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas. How do you feel about book clubs? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't get it. This was supposed to be the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria. What happened? 
     
    Fluttershy What's that? Oh! Uh-huh... Twilight! They know what happened here! 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Stop! You have to listen to me! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony freeze!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  It's a lot harder to freeze an army of ponies than just six of them! 
    Fluttershy  Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know! Long ago, there were two best friends... 

    Fluttershy  ...Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt. When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops! 
     
    Fluttershy  They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud! 
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Fluttershy  The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains. 

    Fluttershy Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire. You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Big Daddy McColt Aw, shucks, we never meant to hurt you little critters. 
    Ma Hooffield Yeah, we're sorry! 
     
    Fluttershy They say they accept your apology. 
     
    Big Daddy McColt Uh, princess? You can unfreeze us now. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, right! 
     
    Big Daddy McColt Ma Hooffield? We promise we won't fight you no more. 
    Ma Hooffield Us too, except we promise not to fight you. I suppose it doesn't matter who's right. We're both wrong. 
    Big Daddy McColt That's one thing we can agree on. 
    Big Daddy McColt and Ma Hooffield  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle This is wonderful! I am so proud of you two! 
    Ma Hooffield Aw, thanks, princess. Though I would just like to point out that I was the, uh, first to admit I was wrong. 
    Big Daddy McColt That may be, but I promised not to fight first. That counts for more! 
    Ma Hooffield Oh, yeah?! 
     
    Ma Hooffield Oh, all right. We don't have to speak animal to know what y'all are sayin'. Truce? 
    Big Daddy McColt Truce. 

     
    Big Daddy McColt Woo-hoo! Ain't that a pretty sight? 
    Ma Hooffield Sure is! The McColts are gonna help us rebuild our homes! Good ones this time. 
    Big Daddy McColt And the Hooffields are gonna help us grow some crops! 
    "Steel Bolts" Not pumpkins. 
    Ma Hooffield Thanks for teachin' us that friendship is so much better than winnin' a silly argument. 
     
    Fluttershy Yay! I told you we'd figure it out. 
    Twilight Sparkle We did, and we didn't need my friendship portfolio to do it. We just needed each other. So, what do you think will happen next? We've all been called by the map now. 
    Fluttershy Oof!  I'm sure we'll find out when we get home... 
    Twilight Sparkle What if it summons all six of us to another place? Or another pony we weren't expecting?  What if it wants us to solve other kinds of problems, like quantum physics, or why the apple doesn't fall far from the tree? 

     

The Mane Attraction

     
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before? 
    Applejack Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo. 
    Twilight Sparkle And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival. 
    Pinkie Pie Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. Everypony! 
    Twilight Sparkle What is it, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, spill it, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! 
    Applejack Sapphire Shores? 
    Pinkie Pie Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura! 
    Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle Ahhh... 
    Applejack Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura? 
    Sweetie Drops and Lyra Heartstrings  
    Amethyst Star  
    Fluttershy, Noteworthy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Royal Riff, Spike, Sprinkle Medley and Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Pinkie Pie My frizz has been freaked! 

     

    Applejack Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?! 
    Applejack Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly.  Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh. 
    Pinkie Pie Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura? 
    Applejack Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess. 
    Pinkie Pie Do you remember her cutie mark? 
    Applejack Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light. 
    Pinkie Pie You mean... like this?! 
    Applejack Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark! 
    Pinkie Pie Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot of hoops! That pony is very demanding! 
    Applejack Nah. 
    Pinkie Pie Yah! 
    Rarity I completely understand. We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work. 
    Applejack This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me! 
    Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Royal Riff, Spike, Sprinkle Medley and Twilight Sparkle Rara?! 
    Applejack Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to "Rara"! 

     
    Applejack  We had the best time at Camp Friendship! 
     
    Applejack  Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch. 
     
    Applejack  Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard! 

    

        Equestria, the land I love 
        A land of harmony 
        Our flag does wave from high above 
        For ponykind to see 

        Equestria, a land of friends 
        Where ponykind do roam 
        They say true friendship never ends 
        Equestria, my home 

     
     
    Applejack  After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but... 

    Applejack ...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me. 
    Pinkie Pie I don't have to wait â€“ she's here! 
    Applejack Really? 
     
     
    Applejack Rara? 

    Pinkie Pie  Countess Coloratura! 
    Svengallop Clear the way! Stand back! Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves! 
     
    Applejack No... that can't be her.  Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname "Rara"? 
    Countess Coloratura AJ? 
    Applejack Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara! 
    Svengallop  
     
    Countess Coloratura Hoofsies!  
    Rarity Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special! 
    Countess Coloratura Hoofsies! Hoofsies! Hoofsies!  
    Applejack Yeah... real special. 
    Svengallop Now that's how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was muddied a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually know her? 
    Countess Coloratura Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara. 
    Svengallop Oh, yes, how cute and... common. Of course, I was the one that started calling you Countess, and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why, you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is the pony Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir! 
    Svengallop Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura? 
    Pinkie Pie I have twenty glass containers full right here! 
     
    Svengallop Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages? 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw Fernando. 
     
    Svengallop Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs her run-through, shall we? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, we shall! 
    Svengallop Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot gardens... Chocolate Ã©clairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow... 
    Pinkie Pie Abso-toot-ly! 
    Svengallop Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal! 
    Pinkie Pie See, Applejack? Demanding! 
    Applejack Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated. 
    Rarity Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change. 
    Applejack She's become a whole other pony! 
    Rarity Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it! 

    

        Time for the spectacle 
        Time for the show 
        The lights are bright and the colors glow 

        I'm not just anypony 
        I think you know 
        The time is now, it's about to blow! 

        Razzle dazzle 
        Glitz and glam 
        Turn it all up, it's a spectacle 

        Razzle dazzle 
        Glitz and glam 
        Turn it all up, it's a spectacle 

        Give me more 
        Razzle dazzle 
        Glitter eyes, big surprise 
        Lights, cameras 

         

        Razzle dazzle 
        Glitz and glam 
        Turn it all up, it's a spectacle 

        Hear the applause 
        Here to impress 
        Not just a pony, I am the Countess! 

     
    Applejack Rarity was right! I don't believe it! 
    Svengallop Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that I designed, your performance was spectacular, Countess Coloratura! 
    Countess Coloratura Oh, , thank you, Svengallop! 
    Applejack Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura. 
    Rarity Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them. 
    Applejack If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. 

    Countess Coloratura Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop. 
    Pinkie Pie Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies! 
    Svengallop Ugh. I can totally get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess. 
    Countess Coloratura Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies! 
    Applejack The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara! 

    Countess Coloratura Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of you will get a chance to sing with me onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun? 
     
    Countess Coloratura Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies? 
     
    Applejack Now that's more like the Rara I remember. 
    Pinkie Pie  But... I got everything you requested! 
    Svengallop That was for Countess Coloratura! This is for me! And what I want is premium oats! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville! 
    Svengallop I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by apple trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours! 
    Pinkie Pie  But that's impossible! 
    Svengallop Do you want me to pull Countess Coloratura from your little podunk charity show?! Because I will! 
    Pinkie Pie Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he saidâ€” 
    Applejack I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up. 
    Apple Bloom Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?! 
    Countess Coloratura Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ? 
    Apple Bloom Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about me?! 
    Countess Coloratura AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom! 
     
    Applejack Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies. 
    Countess Coloratura  
    Applejack Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager? 
    Countess Coloratura Sure, what about him? 
    Applejack Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie. 
    Countess Coloratura Svengallop works very hard as my manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't see anything wrong with that. 
    Applejack Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival? 
    Countess Coloratura What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image! 
    Applejack I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work. 
    Countess Coloratura That's not true! Svengallop has always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things because you're jealous! 
    Applejack Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara! 
    Countess Coloratura I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have clearly gone in different directions! 

     
    Applejack It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it! 
    Pinkie Pie Enough stewin', more peelin'! 
    Applejack Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that! 
    Pinkie Pie  

    Applejack Countess Coloratura! 
    Countess Coloratura Wow, AJ, you said my real name. 
    Applejack I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events. 
    Countess Coloratura Ugh, not this again. 
    Applejack Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true. 
    Countess Coloratura And just how are you going to do that? 
    Applejack Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart. 

    Countess Coloratura Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop? 
    Svengallop Here I am! Did you need something? 
    Countess Coloratura Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...? 
    Svengallop Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest. 
    Countess Coloratura You... have? 
    Svengallop You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that I built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Svengallop We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me! 
     
     
    Svengallop Cancel the contest for the fillies and schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity! 

    Svengallop Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of! 
     
    Svengallop  You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity! 
    Countess Coloratura So that's how you've been managing things? 
    Svengallop Yeah, so? What's the problem? 
    Countess Coloratura The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want! 
    Svengallop But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get! 
    Countess Coloratura But not because you scare ponies into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I would never cancel the schoolponies' contest! 
    Svengallop Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little Rara I met back in Manehattan! 
    Countess Coloratura You clearly don't understand the real me! 
    Svengallop Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without me? Good luck, Countess Coloratura! Good luck. 
    Applejack Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight? 
    Countess Coloratura Of course. After all, the show must go on! 

    Coloratura Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible! 
    Applejack Can you give us a minute, Rarity? 
    Rarity Certainly. 
    Applejack Now, why's it gonna be so terrible? 
    Coloratura Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing! 
    Applejack Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Good evening, everypony! Welcome to opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great honor to introduce you to our headlining act â€“ Countess Coloratura! 
     
    Coloratura This song may be familiar, but yet, it's totally different. Kind of like me, Rara. 
     

    

        I'm here to show you who I am 
        Throw off the veil, it's finally time 
        There's more to me than glitz and glam, oh-whoa 
        And now I feel my stars align 

        For I had believed what I was sold 
        I did all the things that I was told 
        But all that has changed, and now I'm bold 
        'Cause I know 

        That I am just a pony 
        I make mistakes from time to time 
        But now I know the real me 
        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true 
        Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
        And let the magic in my heart stay true 
        Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
        Just like the magic inside of you 

        And now I see those colors 
        Right before my eyes 
        I hear my voice so clearly 
        And I know that it is right 

        They thought I was weak, but I am strong 
        They sold me the world, but they were wrong 
        And now that I'm back, I still belong 
        'Cause I know 

        That I am just a pony 
        I make mistakes from time to time 
        But now I know the real me 
        And put my heart out on the line 

        And let the magic in my heart stay true 
        Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
        And let the magic in my heart stay true 
        Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
        Just like the magic inside of you 

        Just like the magic inside of you... 

     
    Coloratura  Thank you, everypony! When I arrived at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I had forgotten who I really was! But then an old friend reminded me what real friendship is about, and she told me that if I was true to myself, I couldn't go wrong! So I have a very special surprise for her. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, come on up! 

    

        Equestria, the land I love 
        A land of harmony 
        Our flag does wave from high above 
        For ponykind to see 

        Equestria, a land of friends 
        Where ponykind do roam 
        They say true friendship never ends 
        Equestria, my home 

     

     

The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1

    Twilight Sparkle If somepony had told me when I was a blank flank that one day I'd give a speech to a class at Celestia's School of Magic, I wouldn't have believed it, but... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I hope that I have been up to the task, because I can tell that all of you are and that the future of Equestrian magic is in good hooves. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards. 
    Spike Come on, Twilight! You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be... 
    Spike  Perfect? 
    Twilight Sparkle Exactly. Let's go through it one more time.  When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject magic. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Obviously, the long term effects of... 
    Audience Pony Shhhh. 
    Twilight Sparkle ...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but...  Ahem. Next slide, please. 
    Spike  Huh? Huh! 
    Twilight Sparkle I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It must be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle But, um... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect. 

    Spike Starlight Glimmer? 
    Twilight Sparkle I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to. 
    Spike Nothing good, I bet. I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something! 
    Spike And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech! 
    Twilight Sparkle Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right. 

    Twilight Sparkle Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought. 
    Spike Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly. 
    Spike Or it's totally true! 
    Starlight Glimmer Welcome home, Twilight! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing, Starlight? 
    Starlight Glimmer  
     
     
     
    Spike Where'd she go? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out! 
    Spike I guess we could start with this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, no! Don't touch that! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
     
    Pinkie Pie Huh!  

    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
    Spike  Cloudsdale? Starlight doesn't even have wings! Why would she come here? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned. 
     
    Spike Isn't that Rainbow Dash? 
    Twilight Sparkle Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think... 
    Spike ...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria? 
     
    Spike With this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no! 
    Spike Come on, let's go! 
    Twilight Sparkle Go where? 
    Spike To watch the race. I don't wanna miss the rainboom! Whoa! 

    Young Fluttershy  
     
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
    Young Hoops Heh. Later, Rainbow Crash! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Hey! 
    Starlight Glimmer Aw, sorry about this. 
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Hey! What gives? 
     
    Young Fluttershy  
     

    Young Applejack  

    Young Pinkie Pie  
     

     

    Young Twilight Sparkle  
     
     

    Twilight Sparkle What did you do?! 
    Starlight Glimmer You are about to find out. 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh... I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late. 
    Spike Um, Twilight? I think it already is. 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Spike Uh, Twilight? Where's your castle? 
    Twilight Sparkle The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here! 
    Spike But why? And how did we get here? Where's here? 
    Twilight Sparkle More like when. 
    Spike What do you mean? 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present! 
    Spike So we're back whereâ€” I mean, when we started? 
    Twilight Sparkle Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria! 
    Spike Plus there's the whole missing castle thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Right! This is too big to handle on our own. 
    Spike You think? 
    Twilight Sparkle We need to find our friends and get help! 

     
    Spike I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be? 
    Spike Is that Sugarcube Corner? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't understand. 
    Spike  Rarity? 
     
    Spike  Rarity?! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change! 

     
     
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack?! 
    Applejack What can I do for you? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here! 
    Applejack Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter? 
    Twilight Sparkle You... don't know who I am? 
    Applejack Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago. 
    Spike Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet. 
    Applejack Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else. 
    Twilight Sparkle The cause? 
    Applejack The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire? 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike What?! 
    Applejack Where have you two been? 
    Spike Actually, it's when. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends! 
    Applejack Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it. 

    Applejack Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before. 
    Spike There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it. 
    Applejack But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different! 
    Applejack Different how? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, for one thing, where we come from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed! 
    Applejack That's easy enough.  When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it. 

     
    Applejack  And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria. 

     
     
     
    King Sombra  
     
     
    Applejack  And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends! 
    Applejack But we aren't friends. At least not here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Right. 
    Applejack Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you. We're going to set things right. 
    Applejack  I hope you do. 
    Spike So... how are we gonna set things right? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom. 
    Spike And that the map's still here. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there! 
     
     

     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle All we have to do now is find Starlight andâ€” 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me?  I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me! 
     

     
    Spike Twiliiiiiiight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oops! 
    Spike  Thanks! 
    Twilight Sparkle No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, keep your eyes peeled. 
    Spike Right! 
    Twilight Sparkle We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by! 
    Spike Um, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle So be ready. 
    Spike I know, butâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Because she could pop up anywhere! 
    Spike Like over there? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Starlight Glimmer Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's going on here? 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how hurtful teasing can be. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, don't! 
    Young "Dumb-Bell" and Hoops Huh? 
    Young Fluttershy Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle I mean... you were? 
    Starlight Glimmer Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it? 
    Twilight Sparkle No, of course not... 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice? 
    Young "Dumb-Bell", Fluttershy and Hoops Mm-hmm. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing! 
    Young Hoops Come on, Fluttershy. Maybe I can help you get through the course this time. 
    Young Fluttershy Well, I-I sure could use the practice... 
    Twilight Sparkle I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom! 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus. 
     
    Spike Look! 
    Twilight Sparkle This isn't over yet! 
    Starlight Glimmer If you say so! 

    Twilight Sparkle Hi! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Um... hi? 
    Twilight Sparkle You think you can stop for a minute? 
    Young Rainbow Dash Sure. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I hear you're pretty fast! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Pretty fast? Please! I'm even faster than that! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race? 
    Young Rainbow Dash Um, that wouldn't really be fair. I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and... Wait. Are you an Alicorn? 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, I thought you were fast! 
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be. 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom! 
    Young Rainbow Dash What?! I can't do that! Nopony can! It's not even a real thing! It's just an old mare's tale! 
    Twilight Sparkle But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Ooookay... I'm gonna go now. 
    Twilight Sparkle No! Wait! 
    Starlight Glimmer Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     

     
     
    Spike Ugh. Well, that didn't work. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is gonna be harder than I thought. We'll have to try again! 
    Spike Hey, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't want to live in that awful future we saw! 
    Spike I don't think you'll have to! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie? Fluttershy? 
    Pinkie Pie Silence, changeling! 
    Fluttershy All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     

     

The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2

     

    Spike Starlight Glimmer? 
    Twilight Sparkle I was sure I saw her, Spike! 

    Starlight Glimmer Welcome home, Twilight! 

    Spike We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash performed her first sonic rainboom? 

    Starlight Glimmer Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bond! 

    Twilight Sparkle But whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here! 

    Twilight Sparkle I don't want to live in that awful future we saw! 
    Spike I don't think you'll have to. 
    Fluttershy All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed! 
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

    Twilight Sparkle Wait! We're not changelings! I'm a pony! And he's a dragon! 
    Pinkie Pie A likely story! Do something dragonish! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie  That works! 
    Fluttershy The servants of Chrysalis will do anything to save their evil skins! 
    Zecora Stop! If they are changelings we'll soon see. Though I think they're not what they appear to be. 
    Twilight Sparkle Zecora! Please, you have to listen. 
    Zecora Beneath this salve, no changeling hides, for it reveals the truth inside. 
     
    Pinkie Pie What does it mean? 
    Zecora The meaning is far worse, I see, for it is we who should not be. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think I can explain. 
    Zecora I'm sure you can, but let's not talk here. Chrysalis and her army will soon draw near! 

    Zecora The changelings took over not long ago. Though I'll wager in your world that isn't so. 
    Twilight Sparkle Chrysalis and her army tried to take over Canterlot, but my friends and I stopped her. 
    Zecora Those friends as you know them are not here, alas. But tell me how all this came to pass. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight Glimmer, a pony who traveled back in time to stop my friends and me from ever coming together! 
    Zecora And it is these friends you have in life that keep Equestria free from strife? 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess so. But this is the second time I've come back and this world is even worse than the last one! If Starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past, how could the present be so different? 
    Zecora Ah. Time is a river, where even the tiniest changes seen can lead to a cascade of effects downstream. 

    Zecora This part of the forest is dark and damp, but it's done well to hide our camp. 
     
    Spike This is cozy. 
    Rarity  Please! You have to help us! 
    Rainbow Dash The changelings attacked Ponyville! We barely escaped with our lives! 
    Zecora The only changeling attack I see is the one that come here looking for me! 
    Applejack It's taken quite a while to find you, Zecora.  
    Queen Chrysalis  Oh, come now, Zecora. You're vastly outnumbered. 
     
    Queen Chrysalis I know you don't want your charges hurt. Come quietly to the dungeons of Canterlot and I promise to leave the others alone. 
    Fluttershy Why would she ever trust you?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Even if there's a chance Chrysalis will honor her word, shouldn't you try? 
    Zecora  Race to the map while we hold off their attack. Stop Starlight and put the whole world back on track! 
    Queen Chrysalis Time to make a decision, Zecora! 
    Zecora Even if what you are saying were true, we'd never surrender to a creature like you!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     

     
    Starlight Glimmer Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than that! 
    Twilight Sparkle Lucky for you, there's more where that came from! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer You've really gotta work on your aim. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer  
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Whoa!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle What are you doing? You have to finish your race! 
    Young Rainbow Dash No way! This is way more exciting! 
    Starlight Glimmer See? You can't stop me no matter what you do. 
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Aw, man. 

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  
    Spike That's strange. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you obviously don't mean us falling, because that's becoming pretty routine. 
    Spike No, it's just the other times we've come back, it's been day! But look! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why would the map bring us back to a different time of day than when we left? 
     
    Spike Um, maybe we should figure it out later! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  The Castle of the Two Sisters! 
     
    Spike Well, don't just stand here! 

     
    Spike This place looks a lot cleaner than I remember. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity? 
    Rarity The castle isn't open for viewings today. The tapestries all need changing. Again. 
    Spike Rarity, it's me! 
    Rarity I don't socialize with dragons. I don't know anypony who would. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, you have to listen to me! The future of Equestria's at stake! 
    Rarity I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies. 
    Twilight Sparkle I have to get back to the map so I can stop Starlight from changing the past, because every present I come to is worse than the last! 
    Nightmare Moon Time travel, you say? Now that's something I would like to see. 

    Nightmare Moon  Tell me how you came by this magic to travel through time. 
    Rainbow Dash The princess asked you a question! And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, you'll tell her what she wants to know! 
    Nightmare Moon Nopony in my kingdom but me should possess a magic powerful enough to change time. 
    Spike Your kingdom? 
    Nightmare Moon Who else? 
    Spike Um... Celestia, of course! 
    Nightmare Moon  My sister has been imprisoned in the moon for years! But it is no less a fate than she'd sentence me to! Now, reveal to me the source of this time magic! 
    Twilight Sparkle ...Alright. 
    Spike Twilight, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle We have no choice, Spike.  I can take you to it, but you'll have to get past the timberwolves. 
    Nightmare Moon I am the ruler of all of Equestria. Do you think I can't deal with timberwolves? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. I know you can. 
    Nightmare Moon And if you were thinking of trying to escape... 
     
    Nightmare Moon ...it would be very unfortunate for your friend. 

     
     
     
    Nightmare Moon How does it work? 
    Twilight Sparkle A pony from my time used this spell to travel back and change the past. 
    Nightmare Moon And now you will give this spell to me! With it, I will ensure that the Elements of Harmony are never found and my reign lasts forever! 
    Twilight Sparkle But it won't. 
    Nightmare Moon What?! 
    Twilight Sparkle In my world, my friends and I found the Elements and used them to defeat you! And I will do everything in my power to bring that world back! 
    Nightmare Moon No! 
     
    Nightmare Moon Noooooo! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Now more than ever I know how important it is to stop you! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Well, good luck! 
    Young Rainbow Dash Whoooaaaa! 
     

     
     

     
    Starlight Glimmer  

     
     
     

     
     
     

     
    Starlight Glimmer Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. You were right. I can't stop you. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle But you can't stop me from trying, and we could be stuck doing this for all eternity! 
    Starlight Glimmer If that's what it takes to keep you and your friends from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle What you're doing goes way beyond cutie marks! Everything we do here in the past â€“ even the smallest change â€“ can snowball into an avalanche of trouble for the future! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, next I suppose you'll tell me that "the fate of all of Equestria hangs in the balance"! 
    Twilight Sparkle It does! 
    Starlight Glimmer Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, not even Princess Twilight's, is that important! 
     
    Young Rainbow Dash Aaaaaaah! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know how important other ponies' friendships are to the future, but I can show you what the world is like without mine! 

     
    Starlight Glimmer Where are we?! 
    Twilight Sparkle The future. Or rather, the present. 
    Starlight Glimmer But there's nothing here! 
    Twilight Sparkle I wish I could say I was surprised. But every world I come back to is worse than the last. I don't know why my friends and I are so important to Equestria, but we are. 
    Starlight Glimmer I don't believe you! 
    Spike Come on, Starlight, look around! 
    Twilight Sparkle Like I said, everything in the past affects the future, even the tiniest act. And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind. 
    Starlight Glimmer Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before you and your friends ruined what I built! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away. 
    Starlight Glimmer You want to know what happened to me?! I'll show you! 
     
     

    Twilight Sparkle Where are we? 
    Starlight Glimmer That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today. 
     
     
    Sunburst  
     
    Starlight Glimmer And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again. 
    Spike Well, why not? 
    Starlight Glimmer Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away. 
    Starlight Glimmer Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends! 
     

     
    Starlight Glimmer You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I do know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you! 
    Starlight Glimmer I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends! 
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! What's so special about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?! 
    Twilight Sparkle The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong! 
    Starlight Glimmer I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart! 
    Twilight Sparkle So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just my friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance! 
    Starlight Glimmer How do I know they won't all end the same way? 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't. 
     
     
     
     

     
     
     
    Spike  One Castle of Friendship â€“ check! 
     
    Rarity What in Equestria was that?! 
    Fluttershy Is everypony okay? 
    Pinkie Pie  Can you do it again? 
    Spike One group of amazing friends â€“ check! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home! 
    Applejack Uh... what's she doin' here? 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, it's kind of a long story. 

     
    Rainbow Dash I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it! 
    Pinkie Pie Or on us! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful. 
    Applejack I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that. 
    Pinkie Pie That Starlight must be pretty magical! 
    Twilight Sparkle She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place. 
    Applejack But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we? 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, I kind of have something else in mind. 

     
    Starlight Glimmer  I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous. 
    Starlight Glimmer I know first-hoof how true that can be. 
    Twilight Sparkle And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place. 
    Starlight Glimmer  How do I start? 
    Twilight Sparkle Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend! And you've got seven of them right here. 

    

        I never thought that I would find a place 
        To step right in and start again 
        I never thought that I could just begin 
        Right where I left off and make a friend 

    

        Don't ever think that it might be too late 
        You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make 
        A friendship's only made of what you bring 
        And if you do it right, you can do anything 

    

        Just use your eyes 
        This time, no lies 
        Just don't disguise 
        Who you are inside 

        Because your friends are always there for you 
        You don't have to be the same for friendship to be true 
        Because your friends are always there for you 
        Around the world, it's still the same 
        Together you have more to gain 
        There's nothing that a friend won't do 

        Everywhere you go 
        Friendship there will grow 
        When you find it, it's the key 
        Friends can change the world, you see 

        Everywhere you go 
        Friendship there will grow 
        When you find it, it's the key 
        Friends can change the world (ah-ah) 
        Friends can change the world (ah-ah) 
        Friends can change the world, you see 

     

The Crystalling - Part 1

    Starlight Glimmer  Okay. Library... Library... Where did they put the library? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside. 
     
     
    Spike  Morning, Starlight! 
    Starlight Glimmer Whoops! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you? 
    Spike  Next door on the left! 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh. Thanks! 
    Twilight Sparkle Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in! 
    Starlight Glimmer Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be! 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's! 

     

    Starlight Glimmer I know I'm just learning about friendship, but I didn't think there were this many lessons for anything. How do we choose? 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby! 
    Starlight Glimmer Throne room! Got it!  
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Rainbow Dash Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling! 
    Fluttershy But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation? 
    Applejack Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling. 
    Starlight Glimmer What's a Crystalling? 
    Rarity Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky. 
    Applejack We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby. 
    Pinkie Pie  And a party! 
    Fluttershy And the Crystal Heart. 
    Pinkie Pie  And a party! 
    Rainbow Dash And some kinda cool energy. 
    Pinkie Pie And... a party! 
     
    Spike It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example! 
    Rarity  
    Spike Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia! 
    Starlight Glimmer What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power? 
    Spike The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess. 
    Starlight Glimmer Protect it from what? 
    Spike I... didn't help Twilight with that part. 

     
    Starlight Glimmer Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire! 
    Starlight Glimmer Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives! 
    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone.  Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Starlight? Is something wrong? 
    Starlight Glimmer What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know! I guess you were right â€“ it is gonna be hard to choose one! 
    Starlight Glimmer  ...Yeah. 

     
     
     
     
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place! 
    Spike Gee, Starlight, what's wrong? 
    Starlight Glimmer I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them. 
    Spike Which one? 
    Starlight Glimmer Reuniting me with my first friend. 
    Spike What's so terrible about that? 
    Starlight Glimmer  When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left... 
    Spike You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle. 
    Spike Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh...  exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say. 
    Starlight Glimmer I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Come quick! 
     
    Spike It's a Crystalling invitation! 
    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst! 
    Starlight Glimmer Great... 

     
    Rainbow Dash  Um, Applejack, what is that? 
    Applejack Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity Ooh! 
    Pinkie Pie Pretty! 
     
    Applejack Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it. 
    Rarity And a fetching blanket to keep you warm. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny! 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North. 
    Starlight Glimmer Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait! 
    Starlight Glimmer Right... Me neither...  Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch! 
    Starlight Glimmer  

     
    Twilight Sparkle  Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the baâ€” 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Shining Armor! 
    Shining Armor  Twilight...! 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't know you were meeting us! 
    Shining Armor  Of course I am! It's me, right here. Here I am. Why wouldn't I come meet my sister? Though we have met before, heh-heh... 
    Twilight Sparkle Are you all right? 
    Shining Armor  Sorry. I haven't really slept since Cadance had the baby. Come to think of it, she hasn't either. It sure would be great to get a break. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson. 
    Twilight Sparkle I just wish there was a way to do both. 
    Spike Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, you're a genius! 
    Starlight Glimmer  genius. 
    Twilight Sparkle Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's! 
    Spike Aye-aye, Princess! 
    Starlight Glimmer  Uh-huh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony! 
    Shining Armor  Ahhh... the baby... 

    Spike I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered. 
    Starlight Glimmer Everything except how I'd rather do absolutely anything else. 
    Spike Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. Trust the lesson. 
    Starlight Glimmer Right...  Hey, i-is that... you? 
    Spike Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house isâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Why is there a statue of you in the Crystal Empire? 
    "Scarlet Heart" Because Spike the Brave and Glorious saved all of us from King Sombra! 
    "Amber Laurel" And then again during the Equestria Games! 
    Starlight Glimmer Really? 
    "Golden VÃ¤s" Really!  Big fan. 
    Starlight Glimmer Um, when were you going to tell me about this? 
    Spike Nah, it's no big deal. 
    Crystal Ponies It most certainly is! 
    Starlight Glimmer That's it! We're not going anywhere until I get the whole story! 

    Shining Armor Before we go in, I should probably tell you. Seeing the baby might be a bit of a shock. 
    Twilight Sparkle Come on, big brother. I've met babies before. I expect meeting this one won't be any different.  
    Flurry Heart  
    Twilight Sparkle Of course, I could be wrong. 

    Flurry Heart  
    Twilight Sparkle The baby is an Alicorn?! 
    Princess Cadance  It looks that way. 
    Rarity But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed! 
    Applejack Yeah. How can you just be born with 'em? 
    Princess Celestia The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen! 
    Princess Luna It is beyond even our understanding. 
    Fluttershy  That's not very reassuring. 
    Pinkie Pie Wow! A unicorn, and a Pegasus! So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I know all about super-strong flying! 
    Twilight Sparkle And I can help keep tabs on her magic! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Princess Celestia It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn! 
    Princess Luna The crowds have already started to gather. 
    Pinkie Pie  This Crystalling is gonna be some party! 
     
    Princess Cadance Do you think we should call it off? 
    Rainbow Dash Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic. 
    Rarity I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash  
    Princess Celestia In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever.  Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that. 
    Princess Cadance Hm.  
    Flurry Heart  
    Shining Armor  
    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony? 
    Shining Armor  Huh? Oh, no! I still have to interview the honor guards, choose the purity crystal, and pick a crystaller! 
    Twilight Sparkle Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Flurry Heart  
    Applejack And we'll all help you with everythin' else. 
    Shining Armor  ...baby... 
    Rarity That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how. 

    Spike ...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire. 
     
    "Cloudy Spinel" We love you, Spike! 
    "Coral Shores" Yeah. Tell the one about the Equestria Games! 
    Spike Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship! 
    Foals Awwww! 
    Starlight Glimmer Aw, come on, Spike! I want to hear about the Games too! 
     
    Spike I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, "Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off." 
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh. Let's go get this over with. 

    Spike Wait! 
    Starlight Glimmer Huh? What?! 
    Spike Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list! 
    Starlight Glimmer Seriously? 
    Spike I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right! 
    Starlight Glimmer Fine. What's the next thing on the list? 
    Spike  "Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting." 
    Starlight Glimmer I'm pretty sure we can skip that. 
    Spike I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment.  "Highlight the importance of the meeting" â€“ check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that! 
     
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst? 
    Sunburst Yes? What can I do for you? 
    Starlight Glimmer It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends? 
    Sunburst  Oh, of course! S-Starlight! My goodness, it-it's been a long time! What, uh, what have you been up to? 
    Starlight Glimmer Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil. 
    Sunburst The Princess of Friendship? 
    Starlight Glimmer Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy. 
    Sunburst What do you mean? 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but... 
    Sunburst Oh. No. Y-Yes! Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup.  Right. Uh, well... good to see you. 
     
    Spike Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I guess that's that! 
    Spike Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants! 
    Starlight Glimmer  
     
     

    Princess Cadance  Dearest citizens, I am sure you are all just as thrilled and ready for this Crystalling as myself and Shining Armor. 
     
    Shining Armor  I'm not ready! 
    Rainbow Dash Take it easy! Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material. 
    Shining Armor Right... right. 
     
    Royal guards  
    Shining Armor I'm sorry. Fatherhood is way more stressful than I ever thought. 
    Fluttershy I can only imagine. 
    Rarity Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure. 
    Fluttershy Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same? 
    Rarity Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor? 
    Shining Armor  I don't know! 
    Rarity  I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby! 

    Flurry Heart  
    Pinkie Pie Well... at least she's having... fun! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie, hold her still! 
    Pinkie Pie I'm tryiiiiiiing! 

    Sunburst So... the Princess of Friendship wants you and I to be friends again? 
    Starlight Glimmer Heh, I know. Weird, right? 
    Sunburst Uh, I don't understand. Did something happen to you after I left for magic school? 
    Starlight Glimmer What? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer I mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school? 
    Sunburst What? Um, no. L-Like you said, I'm a,  i-important wizard. 
    Spike I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here. 

    Shining Armor  
     
    Shining Armor Okay. I chose the honor guard, picked the purity crystal, and I know exactly who I want to be our crystaller. So, all we need is... 
    Princess Cadance The baby? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle We're here! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Pinkie Pie She's a really strong flyer! 
     
    Flurry Heart  
     
     
    Everypony  
    Flurry Heart  
    Applejack I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's worse than that. Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow! 
    Flurry Heart  
     

     

The Crystalling - Part 2

     

    Starlight Glimmer I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil. 

    Twilight Sparkle Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! 

    Twilight Sparkle Your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst! 

    Sunburst Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup.  Important wizard! 

    Twilight Sparkle The baby is an Alicorn?! 

    Pinkie Pie So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic! 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow! 

    Everypony  

     

    Rarity So... not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony, but we're also about to be frozen solid! 
    Twilight Sparkle Without the Crystal Heart's magical protection, the entire city's about to become a winter wasteland! 
    Applejack But what about when King Sombra ruled the Crystal Empire and the Crystal Heart was missin'? The city wasn't covered in snow then! 
    Twilight Sparkle The Heart wasn't missing. It was still in the castle. King Sombra had just hidden it. 
    Princess Celestia I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming. 
     
    Rainbow Dash I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies! No problem! 
    Princess Celestia I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know. 
    Princess Luna This far north, the weather has a will of its own, and now it will only grow stronger, enveloping everything in its path. 
    Princess Cadance Including the Crystal Empire! 
    Twilight Sparkle And us along with it! 

    Spike There's gotta be somethin'... 
    Sunburst I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help. 
    Starlight Glimmer I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off. 
    Sunburst Well, actually, there's several. Mist Mane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship...  But I-I get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell. 
    Starlight Glimmer  Definitely not. 
    Spike Got it!  "And if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past, maybe even something they regret!" 
     
    Sunburst Uh, I don't see how that would help. 
    Starlight Glimmer Uh, yeah! We should just get out of your mane. It's pretty obvious this isn't going how Twilight hoped, and I'm sure you have plenty of important work to do... 
    Sunburst What? Oh! Right, yes, heh-heh! Uh, no rest for the wizardly. 
    Starlight Glimmer Come on, Spike. 
    Spike  
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle There must be a spell that can restore the Crystal Heart! 
    Princess Celestia Perhaps. 
    Princess Luna But it isn't something that either of us know. 
    Princess Cadance The library here at the castle is nearly as extensive as the one in Canterlot. There's a good chance we can find something there! 
    Twilight Sparkle Can you hold off the storm? 
    Princess Luna Yes, for a time, but even our magic will eventually succumb to the power of the Frozen North. 
    Princess Celestia We will do what we can, but you must hurry. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know how long it will take to find the right spell, but you should probably tell the crowd outside to get somewhere warm! 
    Princess Cadance And try not to mention the Crystal Heart. We don't want to start a panic. 
    Applejack Yes, ma'am. C'mon, girls! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm gonna need all of your help. The crystal library is enormous! 
    Shining Armor You can count on us, Twily! 
    Flurry Heart  
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Shining Armor Where'd she go?! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Princess Cadance This way! 

    Starlight Glimmer Well, Spike, looks like my biggest fears came true. I wouldn't be surprised if Twilight decides to give up on me entirely. 
    Spike Aw, it's not your fault. I'm the one who said all we needed was this list.  
    Starlight Glimmer It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. I'm the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with. 
    Spike I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends. 
    Starlight Glimmer He didn't have to say it. 
    Spike Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too! 
    Starlight Glimmer Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath. 
    Spike  Uh, that's not dragon breath. It's freezing! 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, you're right! But I thought the Crystal Heart was supposed to keep the cold weather out. 
    Spike It is... unless something's happened! Come on! 

    Rainbow Dash We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside! 
    "Tough Nut" I camped out all night for this spot! I'm not about to just give it up! 
    Fluttershy Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like... inside your house? 
     
    "Scouts Honor" The Crystalling ceremony is one of our most sacred traditions! And when that foal is held before the Crystal Heart, I plan to be as close to the action as possible! 
    Applejack Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'. The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all. 
    "Tough Nut" A baby Alicorn? Wow, I can't wait to see that! 
    "Scouts Honor" Oh, those little wings are probably so cute! 
    "Mustafa Combe" I know, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening. 
     
    "Mustafa Combe" No Crystalling, huh? Then why are they starting the fireworks show? 
     

    Flurry Heart  
    Shining Armor Young filly... come back here! 
    Pinkie Pie Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie! 
    Twilight Sparkle Bridle Buck's Boat Chants, Hayhoof's Intonements, Mystic Maps and Mazes...  Anything up there? 
     
    Princess Cadance Not yet! I'm not even sure how these are organized! 
     
    Flurry Heart  
     
    Princess Cadance Shining Armor, I thought you were taking care of the baby! 
    Shining Armor I'm trying! 
     
    Flurry Heart Whoo! 
    Rarity Gotcha! 
     
    Rarity Oh! Or not... 
    Flurry Heart  
     
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer What is going on?! 
    Pinkie Pie You want the long or the short version? 
    Starlight Glimmer Short? 
    Pinkie Pie  The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh. 
     
    Princess Cadance  What about this? Trotter's Tome of Reliquary? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I think this is it! 
    Princess Cadance  "Spell of Relic Reconstitution"! I can't believe we found it! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's a good thing, too! Without this, I don't know what we'd do! 
     
    Flurry Heart  
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie Oops. 

    Twilight Sparkle That spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed! 
    Starlight Glimmer I'm so sorry, Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle It's not your fault, Starlight. None of us were expecting any of this. 
    Princess Cadance Do you think you can remember the spell? 
    Twilight Sparkle I only read it through once! 
    Rarity Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Is quickly an option? 
    Princess Cadance I'll help if I can, but we should evacuate the city just in case! You need to lead everypony to the train station before the tracks freeze over! 
    Shining Armor We will. But between you and Twilight, I'm sure you'll remember the spell. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle I only hope this spell is the one we need. 
    Starlight Glimmer Is there anything I can do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think so. I'm just sorry about your lesson. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, that doesn't matter now. Sunburst and I don't have anything in common anyway. He's a big important wizard! And I'm re-learning everything I ever thought I knew. 
    Princess Cadance Sunburst? I don't recognize the name, but if he's an important wizard, you should bring him here. Maybe he'll know what to do if the spell fails. 
    Starlight Glimmer  Of course! 
    Twilight Sparkle You better go with her, Spike. 
     
     

     
    Starlight Glimmer  Sunburst! Haven't you looked outside?! 
    Sunburst Snow? That's... not right. The Crystal Heartâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Is gone! The baby â€“ Shining Armor and Cadance's baby â€“ it's an Alicorn! 
    Sunburst Really? 
    Starlight Glimmer Really! And her magic is a little berserk, and well, I guess she destroyed the Heart! But Twilight thinks she can fix it and Princess Cadance thought you could help! 
    Sunburst Me? 
    Starlight Glimmer Of course! You're an important wizard in the Crystal Empire! It just makes sense! 
    Sunburst Right... right... right right right. You know, I'd like to help, I-I really would. I-I just have so much, um, important wizard work to do around here. 
    Spike and Starlight Glimmer Huh?! 

     
    Applejack You can't stay here! 
    "Mustafa Combe" Did I mention this was a Royal Crystalling? When the crystaller holds the young one aloft, all of the Empire will share their joy and light, and the Crystal Heart will beat stronger than it ever has before! 
    "Scouts Honor" It really is a moving ceremony! 
    Fluttershy I really don't think it's going to happen. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, it's freezing out here! 
    "Tough Nut" Uh, this is the Crystal Empire. We've seen snow before. 
    Shining Armor Not like this! We don't have time to argue! Princess Cadance has decided to evacuate the city! 
     
    "Mustafa Combe" But the Crystalling...! 
    Shining Armor I don't know if we'll ever have another Crystalling again! The Crystal Heart... is shattered. 
     
    "Tough Nut" It's not safe here! 
    Applejack  That's what we've been tryin' to tell you! 

    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst, I know you're busy, but did you hear what I said? 
    Sunburst Oh, I heard you, but-but like I said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up. 
    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst! 
    Sunburst  Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could. 
    Starlight Glimmer What do you mean?! 
    Sunburst Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that! 
    Starlight Glimmer But I thought you were an important wizard! 
    Sunburst Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all! 

    Sunburst I know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness. 
    Starlight Glimmer What? Why wouldn't I understand that? 
    Sunburst Really? You're the protÃ©gÃ© of the Princess of Friendship! I don't think she picks just anypony for that! 
    Spike Technically, she's more of a student than a protÃ©gÃ©. 
    Sunburst Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not the big important wizard you were expecting. 
    Starlight Glimmer Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books! 
    Sunburst Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it! 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, you don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends! 
     
    Sunburst Did you really travel through time? 
    Spike See? I told you he'd be impressed. 
    Sunburst I'm sorry we lost touch. Maybe if I had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school, and I could have helped you to... 
    Starlight Glimmer Not become totally evil?  Let's just say I know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of. 
    Sunburst When you showed up thinking I was some big wizard... I'm sorry. I should have told you the truth. 
    Starlight Glimmer It's fine. At least we worked it all out. I think Twilight would be proud of us. 
    Spike Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now! 
    Starlight Glimmer  I forgot to tell you! They're evacuating the city! You need to get to the train station, unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the Frozen North and fix the Crystal Heart so the baby can have her Crystalling? 
    Sunburst Crystalling...! Of course! 

     
    Princess Celestia and Princess Luna  
    Princess Celestia Push them back, my sister! 
     
    Shining Armor This way! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! 
    Applejack Just a little bit further, y'all! The station's just ahead! 
    Starlight Glimmer We have to go back! 
    Sunburst I know how to stop this! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I think that's everything? 
    Princess Cadance It looks right to me, but... there's only one way to find out! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle The spell failed. I don't know what else to do. 
    Princess Celestia An old student of mine believes he does. 
    Sunburst The baby did this?! 
    Twilight Sparkle I tried putting it back together withâ€” 
    Sunburst The spell of Relic Reconstitution. No, that won't do it. The Crystal Heart's been around for millennia. Restoring a relic like this is way beyond one spell. You need to combine it with something else. Something unique to the relic itself. Something that strengthens it and provides it with power...? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle The Crystalling! 
    Sunburst Combining that spell with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony, together with... Somnambula's Weather Abjuration to clear away the snow... and a little Fledgling's Forbearance for the parents... Heh. That should curb the little one's power fluctuations. 
    Flurry Heart  
    Princess Cadance You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard. 
    Sunburst Oh, I'm no wizard. 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash What? 
    Starlight Glimmer But he studied magic his whole life! You should see his house! And since nopony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?! 
    Shining Armor I had planned on asking Twilight to be our crystaller, but since it seems like she'll be busy... 
    Sunburst I'd be honored! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Twilight Sparkle Well, what are we waiting for?! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
     
     
    Flurry Heart  
    Sunburst Citizens! May I present the newest member of the Crystal Empire! 
    Flurry Heart  
     
    "Mustafa Combe" She's beautiful! 
    "Scouts Honor" Oh! It's just so moving! 
     
    Flurry Heart  
     
     
    "Tough Nut" Best Crystalling ever! 
    Starlight Glimmer For a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well. 
    Princess Celestia Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think. 

    Night Light You would not believe the crazy weather that delayed our train. Came out of nowhere. 
    Twilight Velvet But it was all worth it to see this peaceful little angel! Awww, so sweet! Come to your grandmare! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Applejack Yeah, peaceful now, anyway. 
    Twilight Sparkle I suppose that spell really did the trick! 
    Flurry Heart  
    Mane Six  
    Flurry Heart  
     
    Shining Armor We have Sunburst to thank for that. 
    Princess Cadance I hope he takes his role as crystaller seriously. Something tells me the baby will need a pony like him to look to for magical advice. 
    Twilight Velvet Cadance, darling, aren't we gonna name the poor little dear, or are we gonna spend our entire visit just calling her "the baby"? 
    Princess Cadance We were thinking... "Flurry Heart". 
    Shining Armor You know, to remember the occasion. 
    Rarity Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think it's lovely.  
    Flurry Heart  
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not. 
    Sunburst I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility. 
    Starlight Glimmer I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch? 
    Sunburst Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend. 
    Spike What's wrong, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Spike. I think I have a lot to learn about being a teacher. 
    Spike What are you talking about? Your lesson went perfectly! Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship! 
    Twilight Sparkle No thanks to me. I know a lot happened. I just wish I could have given my pupil the attention she deserves. 
    Spike Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well. Isn't that how Celestia taught you? 
    Twilight Sparkle You know, I never thought about it! But I guess it is! 
    Spike Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought. 
     

     

The Gift of the Maud Pie

     
    Pinkie Pie  We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan...! 
    Rarity  Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture... Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well. 
    Pinkie Pie  We're almost there! Why doesn't your face look like this?! Eee... 
    Rarity Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me. I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop. And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into theâ€“  energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria! 
     
    Rarity  This city's simply a-ma-zing! It's just... everything, ever! 
    Pinkie Pie And it's about to get everything ever-er! Because guess who I see! M-A-U-D! You know what that spells? 
    Maud Pie  It spells Maud. 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Pinkie Pie Maud, Maud, Maud! Yay! 

     

    Rarity Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters? 
    Pinkie Pie Yep! I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year! We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset! And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD! 
    Rarity  Okay, what's the secret? 
    Pinkie Pie Huh? 
    Rarity You just said 'pssst'. 
    Pinkie Pie No, silly! Not pssst, PSSSD! P-S-S-S-D! Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Maud! 
    Maud Pie  Boulder promised his cousin a postcard. 
    Rarity Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD. And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique! 
    Pinkie Pie Before you go, can I ask you a quick question? 
    Rarity Oh, of course. 
    Pinkie Pie  Will you please help me?! 
    Rarity  Only if you let go of my leg and stand up... 
    Pinkie Pie Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away! But this year is going to be different! For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me! There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches! A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it! 
    Rarity Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud! 
    Pinkie Pie I know, right? Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown! 
    Rarity Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise... Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to distract Maud, so... 
    Pinkie Pie ...I can sneak away to pick out a rock pouch!  
    Rarity Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud. 
    Pinkie Pie Of course. Got it. Absolutely. 
    Maud Pie  Nothing moved him. 
    Pinkie Pie Maud! I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever! 
     

    Rarity Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here! 
    Maud Pie  Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata. It's breathtaking. 
    Pinkie Pie But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you! 
     

    Rarity I-It certainly isâ€“  â€“cozy... but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind! 
    Pinkie Pie Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her! 
     

     
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud! 
     
    Maud Pie  You'll be pleased with yours too. 

     
    Rarity Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Rarity Oh... A pony could get used to eating at places like this! 
    Maud Pie  I know. It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles. 
    Rarity  You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order! 
    Pinkie Pie  We're so close to the pouch store! It's just a block away! I could practically smell it from here! If I knew what a pouch store smelled like. 
     
    Rarity  Okay, remember the plan. I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch! 
    Pinkie Pie  Gotcha! 
    Rarity  Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie. And now I know exactly what to order. 
    Pinkie Pie  You are very welcome, Rarity! Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Sorry! 
    Rarity So, Maud... that Boulder of yours is such an interesting... ahem... character. You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet? 
    Maud Pie  It was a dark and stormy night. Little did I know that my life was about to change forever. 

     
    Pinkie Pie  Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud will love it! I need it! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ungh! Huh, must be stuck!  Hello, Mr. Pouch Store Owner! I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please! 
    "Copper Top" Miss, the store's clearly closed. 
    Pinkie Pie But it can't be. It just can't be! If I can't get that pouch... then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all! 

     
    Maud Pie  ...and Boulder's been by my side ever since. 
    Rarity  Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean! 
    Pinkie Pie Huh? Oh, right.  
     
    Rarity GarÃ§on! One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat! 
     
    Rarity What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything! 
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud. We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore. We're bound to find something Maud would like. Maybe even more than a rock pouch! 
    Pinkie Pie You're right! Thanks, Rarity! 

     
    Rarity Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe. I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it? 
    Maud Pie  Only if I had a mirror. 

    Rarity Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan! Surely there must be something here that catches your eye. 
    Maud Pie  Boulder says they're all too... stuck-up. 

     
    Rarity  
    Maud Pie  I like... that. 
    Rarity What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?! 
    Maud Pie  I like that fissure in the sidewalk. It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement. 
     
     
    Rarity Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil...? What?! But I...! All of this...! And she likes a crack?! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Did she like anything? 
    Rarity  That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants! 
    Maud Pie  Boulder. Boulder. Where'd you run off to? There you are. Sure wish I had something to carry you around in. 
    Pinkie Pie A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud! Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window! It had double stitching, a red drawstring... 
    Rarity ...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams? 
    Pinkie Pie Yep, that's the pouch.  Wait, how'd you know? 
    Rarity Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could askâ€” 
     
    Pinkie Pie Excuse me, sir! I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch! Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it? I really need it. Like, really really really! 
    "Street Rat" So lemme get this straight You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh? 
    Pinkie Pie I believe I said really really really. 
    "Street Rat" Well, you know, pouches like this are really hard to come by these days. But I might be able to part with it for the right price. 
    Pinkie Pie So you'll sell it to me? And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! 
     
    "Street Rat" Hmmm. That's one sweet party cannon you got there. Tell you what. I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch for the low, low price of... that cannon. 
    Pinkie Pie  M-My... party cannon...? 
    "Street Rat" Well, if you really wanna give that sister of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party cannon. So, what do you say? The pouch for the cannon. 
     

    Maud Pie  Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure? 
    Rarity Probably? 
    Pinkie Pie  What you guys lookin' at? 
    Rarity Oh, you're back!  So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me! 
    Pinkie Pie  Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and... that's really the only thing that matters. 
    Rarity Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it! 
    Pinkie Pie  Yup. 
    Rarity "Yup"? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is "yup"? 
    Pinkie Pie  Yup. 
    Rarity But... you're Pinkie Pie. You're supposed to be all  Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help. But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is. 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, there's no problem. It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon. Who knew? 
    Rarity You gave away your cannon?! But, but that party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters. 
    Rarity Well, I guess I understand... maybe. 
    Pinkie Pie Maud's going to be so excited. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch! 
    Maud Pie  I know, the camera loves Boulder. 

    Rarity After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you!  And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other! 
    Pinkie Pie Well, you're going to have to. We don't just swap, silly. We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first! Ready, Maud? 
    Maud Pie  As I'll ever be. 
    

        It's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong! 

    Maud Pie  Hey. 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, time to swap presents! Hmmmm.  
     
    Rarity  Just open them already! 
     
    Maud Pie  Thanks. 
    Pinkie Pie I knew you'd love it! It was all worth it! Look how happy she is! And I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Rarity. Okay! Time to open your present to me! Oh! You did it again! You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD! This is perfect! This is amazing! This is incredible! I love it, I love it, I love it!  What is it? 
    Maud Pie  It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper. You know, confetti. For your cannon. 
    Pinkie Pie Maud...  

    Rarity You're right, that is impressive. But it's no fissure in the sidewalk. 
    Maud Pie  Play nice. 
    Rarity Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it.  Oh! 
    Maud Pie  What? 
    Rarity I mean... forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch. You can remember that part. Just forget the second part. You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something upâ€”  Perhaps I should just stop talking now. Nothing! 
    Pinkie Pie Hee-hee, yay! I love my sister and my new confetti! 
    Maud Pie  Why isn't she using her party cannon? 
    Rarity Gahhhh... 
     
    Rarity  Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them! 
    Maud Pie  Where's her cannon? 
    Rarity No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't take it! Nnnnn...  Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her! 
    Maud Pie  What? 
    Rarity That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch! 
    Maud Pie  She gave up her party cannon? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second! 
    Pinkie Pie I think I know what this is about. You guys wanna ride the swans. Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can riâ€” 
    Maud Pie  You gave away your party cannon? 
    Rarity  She broke me. 
    Pinkie Pie Nnngh, it's just... It's just... It's just... You always give better gifts than me! That's why I had to get you the perfect gift!  Are your hooves dirty? Where're you going?! 
    Maud Pie  To get your cannon back. 

    Maud Pie  There. 
    Pinkie Pie Yep! That sure is the pony I got the pouch from! 
    Rarity That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be? 
    Maud Pie  Maud Sense. 
    Pinkie Pie Runs in the family! 
    Maud Pie  I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please. 
    "Street Rat" Sorry, missy, all sales are final. 
    Maud Pie  I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please. 
    Rarity Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says! 
    "Street Rat" Fire in her eyes? 
    Rarity Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw! 
    "Street Rat" I didn't see. 
    Rarity Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw... you know what that means?! 
    "Street Rat" What? What's it mean? 
    Rarity Trust me, you do not want to know! 
    Maud Pie  I'd like to return this pouch. 
    "Street Rat"  

     
    Pinkie Pie Maud! I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back! Yay! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Uh-oh. I just realized something. 'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today! And it's something I really, really wanted! You did it again! Your gifts are always better than mine! Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up andâ€” 
    Maud Pie  Pinkie, gift giving isn't a competition. It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to give your gifts with lots of love. That's why I'll always love them, and you, five-ever. That's even longer than for-ever. 
    Pinkie Pie Awwww!  There you are! You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time! We've got a train to catch here! 
    Rarity I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave. 

    Rarity Voila! Welcome to the future home of "Rarity For You"! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I pick a good spot? 
    Maud Pie  No. You picked the perfect spot. 
    Pinkie Pie You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever! But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R! 
    Rarity Wait. PSSS-D-W-R? What's that? 
    Pinkie Pie P-S-S-S-D-W-R! It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with! Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day... 
    Maud Pie  With Rarity. 
    Rarity Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest... Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, Rarity! It doesn't matter what you get us! As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect! 
    Rarity  Why, thank you, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Buuuut now that you mention it... I could use more confetti for my party cannon. You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day! 
     

     

On Your Marks

     
    Apple Bloom Hear ye, hear ye! The first post-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! 
     
    Apple Bloom  
    Sweetie Belle Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something? 
    Scootaloo I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look awâ€” 
     
    Apple Bloom Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks? 
    Sweetie Belle  I guess not. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring... 
    Apple Bloom  This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'! 
    Sweetie Belle Wow, you're right! 
    Scootaloo Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to! 
    Apple Bloom Exactly. 
    Sweetie Belle Like square dancing! 
     
    Scootaloo Or mountain climbing!  
    Apple Bloom Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed!  
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! 
    Apple Bloom And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on! 
    Sweetie Belle Um... Apple Bloom? 

     

    Apple Bloom Wow... Did we really only ever do things just to get our cutie marks? 
    Sweetie Belle I don't know. Maybe? 
    Scootaloo Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark. 
    Sweetie Belle Of course we did! 
    Apple Bloom Absolutely! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do? 
    Apple Bloom We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Helping other ponies! 
    Scootaloo Ponies without cutie marks! 
    Sweetie Belle Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose! 
    Apple Bloom Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on! 

    Sweetie Belle But are you sure you feel content? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Scootaloo Not even a tinge of dissatisfaction? 
    Big McIntosh Nnnope. 
    Apple Bloom Not even the slightest naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark? 
     
    Big McIntosh  Nnnope. 

    Apple Bloom The important thing to remember is that there is no rush. 
    Scootaloo The three of us tried for the longest time, but it just comes when it comes! 
    Sweetie Belle And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of. 
    Scootaloo So if you're having even the slightest problem... 
    Sweetie Belle ...or concerns or questions... 
    Apple Bloom ...we want you to know that we are here to help. 
    Mrs. Cake I... don't think they're too worried about it yet. 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  

     

     
     
     

     

     

    Apple Bloom This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. 
    Sweetie Belle Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks? 
    Scootaloo Kinda makes you wonder why we made such a big deal out of it for so long. 
     
    Scootaloo What? 
    Apple Bloom The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special. 
    Sweetie Belle But if we can't find anypony with a problem... 
    Scootaloo ...Maybe we're not special. 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. I have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle. 
     
    Bulk Biceps What? 

    Bulk Biceps I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy! 
    Scootaloo  The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk. 
    Sweetie Belle A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems! 
    Apple Bloom A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours! 
    Scootaloo No matter how long it takes! 
    Sweetie Belle Or how hard it is! 
    Apple Bloom We'll solve it because that's what we do! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah!  
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
    Sweetie Belle So... what's your cutie mark problem? 
    Bulk Biceps Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville! 
    Scootaloo  Have you tried lifting other things? 
    Bulk Biceps You mean, not dumbbells? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah! 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! 
     
    Bulk Biceps Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. You guys are awesome! 
     
    Bulk Biceps But... what happens when I run out of other stuff? 
    Sweetie Belle ...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! 
    Scootaloo Yeah! 
    Bulk Biceps Yeah! Wow, you three really have a knack for this! 
    Sweetie Belle That was easy! 
    Apple Bloom Maybe too easy. 
    Scootaloo What do you mean? 
    Apple Bloom Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between. 
    Sweetie Belle And...? 
    Apple Bloom And what if we never find another one? 
    Scootaloo Well... 
    Apple Bloom And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place! 
    Sweetie Belle So...? 
    Apple Bloom So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist! 

    Sweetie Belle The problem boils down to this â€“ we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks. 
    Apple Bloom Right! Andâ€” 
    Scootaloo Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find. 
    Apple Bloom Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So... 
     
    Apple Bloom I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems! 
    Scootaloo That kinda seems like a lot. 
    Sweetie Belle I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems. 
    Scootaloo Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Hoof! 
    Apple Bloom But... what do we do until then? 
    Sweetie Belle Maybe whatever we want? 
    Apple Bloom What do you mean? 
    Sweetie Belle Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to. 
    Apple Bloom So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Sure am! 

    Apple Bloom 
    Makin' potions! 

    

    Scootaloo 
    Scootering! 

    

    Sweetie Belle 
    Singing! 

    Scootaloo Just remember â€“ stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me! 
    Apple Bloom If you say so. 
    Scootaloo Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo! 
     
    Scootaloo Ta-da! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom  I don't think I did it right. 

    Sweetie Belle  Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony. 
    Scootaloo Harmony, huh? 
    Sweetie Belle  And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three! 

    Sweetie Belle 
     
    Do... 

    

    Apple Bloom 
     
    So...! 

    

    Scootaloo 
     
    Mi! 

    Scootaloo Wow, that was simple! 
     

    Apple Bloom It's just a dash, and a drop, and a drip! 
     
    Apple Bloom Just a dash, and a drop, and a drip! 
     
     

    Apple Bloom ...and even though Scootaloo thinks bungee jumping is the bee's knees... 
     
    Apple Bloom ...Sweetie Belle would rather keep bees. 
     
    Apple Bloom  Of course, I'm allergic. Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together? 
    Scootaloo Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't? 
    Apple Bloom Didn't what? 
    Scootaloo Do things together. Well, do everything together. 
    Apple Bloom But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
    Scootaloo And we always will be! But I really wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall! 
    Sweetie Belle And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet. 
    Scootaloo Isn't there something you've always wanted to do on your own? 
    Apple Bloom I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'. 
    Scootaloo That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like! 
    Sweetie Belle Just as soon as you figure out what it is. 
    Apple Bloom I guess... 
    Scootaloo Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done! 
    Apple Bloom But I don't know what it'll be. 
    Sweetie Belle You'll find something! 
    Scootaloo Something awesome! 
    Apple Bloom  Well... I guess now I have to. 

    

        I never imagined myself out on my own 
        Tryin' to find out what's next for me 
        The Cutie Mark Crusaders have always been my home 
        Maybe now there's more that I could be 

        I guess as time goes by 
        Everypony has to go out on their own 
        And maybe someday I'll have to try 
        Somethin' new that's just for me 
        A little somethin' that could be 
        Just my own and I won't feel so left behind 

        We used to say that we'd be always side by side 
        Maybe things are changin' and this could mean goodbye 
        I always thought our friendship was all I'd ever need 
        We've always been crusadin' â€“ what else is there for me? 

        I guess as time goes by 
        Everypony has to go out on their own 
        And maybe someday I'll have to try 
        Somethin' new that's just for me 
        A little somethin' that could be 
        Just my own and I won't feel so left behind 

    Hoofer Steps  And one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, two, two, three, fourâ€” 
     
    Apple Bloom Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in!  Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class? 
    Hoofer Steps Well, let's see what you can do. We have a recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up!  Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step into a partnered routine... 
    Apple Bloom That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself! 
    Hoofer Steps Well then! Dancing with partner will be perfect.  
     
    Apple Bloom Whooooooa! 
     
    Apple Bloom Whoa, whoaaa! 
     
     
    Apple Bloom Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends. 
    Hoofer Steps Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist. 

    Hoofer Steps Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own. 
    Apple Bloom I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I don't want. 
     
    Tender Taps Sorry it didn't work out. 
    Apple Bloom Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's just terrible. 
    Tender Taps You weren't that bad. You just need to learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun!  Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling! 
     
    Apple Bloom  Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital. 
    Tender Taps Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying! 
    Apple Bloom  Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you. 
    Tender Taps You, too.  

    Scootaloo Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even more than scootering! 
    Sweetie Belle Seriously?! That's amazing! Look what I did! 
    Scootaloo Wow, uh, that's, um... 
    Sweetie Belle Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says  but I loved it! 
    Scootaloo Awesome! 
     
    Apple Bloom Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your own interests? 
    Scootaloo Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark? 
    Sweetie Belle Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do. 
    Apple Bloom  I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? Nothin'! 
     
    Scootaloo You tried every one of these? 
    Apple Bloom And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore! 
    Scootaloo Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do everything together. 
    Sweetie Belle Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't. 
    Apple Bloom Oh.  Well, I guess that changes things. 
    Scootaloo I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore. 
    Sweetie Belle I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked! 
    Apple Bloom Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it. 
    Sweetie Belle Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun! 
    Scootaloo And being good doesn't always mean you will. 
    Apple Bloom I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to. 
    Sweetie Belle I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he? 

     
    Apple Bloom You're here! 
    Shoeshine Shhhh! 
     
     
    Tender Taps What are you doing here? 
    Apple Bloom You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage! 
     
    Tender Taps Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed, but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What if I'm bad?! 
    Apple Bloom We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me. 
     
    Tender Taps  All right, I'll do it. But I don't have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time to change it! 
    Apple Bloom Leave everything to us. 

    Tender Taps  I don't know about this... 
    Sweetie Belle Don't worry, you'll be just fine! 
     
    Apple Bloom Here goes nothin'... 
     
     
    Tender Taps  
     
    Apple Bloom  
     
     
    Apple Bloom Can't be any worse than I was! 
    Tender Taps  
     
     

    Tender Taps I can't believe it! It's just what I always imagined it would be! And if it weren't for all of you, I wouldn't even have it. 
    Scootaloo No problem! 
    Sweetie Belle It's what we do. 
    Apple Bloom I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason... 
    Tender Taps Well, either way, I hope you keep dancing.  
    Apple Bloom  I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'! 
    Tender Taps Or find out I needed help! 
    Sweetie Belle With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help! 
    Scootaloo And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets! 
    Sweetie Belle Or my crochet to make the costumes! 
    Apple Bloom Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! 

     

Gauntlet of Fire

     
     
    Spike  
    Rarity  Thanks for being my basket holder, Spike. 
    Spike Basket holder? I thought I was your bodyguard. 
    Rarity  What? Oh, heh, yes, yes, that of course, too. Oh, for once I wish unicorn magic wasn't so... luminescent! 
     
    Rarity  Spike! You'll wake the bats! Turn that off! 
    Spike Ugh, I can't!  
    Rarity  
     

     

    Twilight Sparkle I'm so glad you two could come! 
    Princess Luna Of course. We so rarely get a chance to relax and just visit. 
    Princess Celestia There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But todayâ€” 
    Rarity  Help! 
     
    Rarity Twilight! There's something wrong with Spike! 
    Twilight Sparkle What's wrong? 
    Spike  I don't know! Nngh! All of a sudden, my scales just started glowing and... burning! 
    Princess Luna Little is known about dragon culture, but this is a phenomenon we've seen before. It is the call of the Dragon Lord. 
    Princess Celestia Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands. 
    Spike Great... H-How do I make it stop?! 
    Princess Luna The only way to end the summons is to answer it. You must journey to the Dragon Lands and see what is expected of you. 
    Rarity B-B-But the Dragon Lands are full of... dragons! And they're ghastly creatures!  Oh, oh, not you, of course, Spikey-wikey. But remember that rotten Garble? 
    Spike  How could I forget? He would have burnt us to a crisp if you weren't there. If I have to go to the Dragon Lands, would you two come with me? 
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh! Oh my goodness, I'd love to! We are sadly lacking any information on dragon culture and customs. I could research them â€“ maybe even write an article! This could be my chance to make a great contribution to the knowledge of Equestria!  And be there for Spike, heh, of course. 
    Princess Celestia Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet. 
    Rarity Ooh! I'm sure I still have the dragon costume we used the last time we snuck into the Dragon Lands!  
    Twilight Sparkle I think we might want something a little more practical this time. 

    Rarity Hmmm... Well, it may be practical, but this disguise isn't flattering in the slightest! 
    Twilight Sparkle  It's not supposed to be flattering. It's supposed to blend in! 
    Spike Shh! 
    Garble Hey-hey, look! It's our old friend Sparkle-warkle. 
    Spike It's Spike. 
    Garble Are you sure your pony friends didn't give you a pony name? 
    Spike It's nice to see you too, Garble. 
    Garble I didn't say it was nice to see you. It's not. I don't like you. Was I not clear about that? 
    Twilight Sparkle and Rarity  
    Spike Hey! That's my rock! 
    Garble Oh, really? Then why aren't you sitting on it? 
     
    Dragon Lord Torch Dragons of Equestria, hear me! I have been Dragon Lord for longer than many of you can remember, and my reign has been extraordinary!  Agree with me! 
    Dragons  Torch! Torch! Torch! Torch! 
    Spike Who is that? 
    Garble It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy. 
    Spike No, next to him. 
    Garble That's his daughter, Princess Ember. I wouldn't even look at her if I were you, unless you want Torch to eat you! 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says! 
    Dragon Lord Torch Unfortunately, according to dragon law, it is time for me to step down. Sad, I know.  Be sad! 
     
    Dragon Lord Torch This is why I have summoned you â€“ to compete for the throne in the Gauntlet of Fire! 
     
    Dragon Lord Torch Whomever has the strength and fortitude to retrieve this bloodstone scepter from the heart of the flame-cano will be crowned Lord of the Dragons! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much! 
    Rarity  
    Spike Uh, excuse me! 
    Garble Ugh, you even sneeze like a pony! 
    Dragon Lord Torch The Gauntlet is dangerous, for I designed it myself! Only dragons with my ferocity, strength, and determination will be able to finish. We will gather at the cliff when the sun is at its peak! 
     
    Spike I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here! 
    Dragon Lord Torch Ah! Where do you think you're going, little dragon?! 
    Spike Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship. Uh, I was just going home! 
    Dragon Lord Torch You don't get to leave unless I say you can! 
    Princess Ember Dad, look at him. He's just a runt. Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete. Let him go. 
    Dragon Lord Torch He is rather tiny, heh-heh. I could squish him with my pinky claw.  
    Spike  
    Dragon Lord Torch That wasn't a joke. It was a fact. When I want you to laugh, I will say "be amused!" 
    Spike Of course, your Lordship! I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs. Another reason why I shouldn't compete. 
    Dragon Lord Torch  Hm. Very well then, little dragon. I release you. 
    Spike Thank you!  And thank you. 
    Dragon Lord Torch  Where do you think you're going? 
    Princess Ember To prepare for the Gauntlet. 
    Dragon Lord Torch No, you're not. You're not much bigger than that runt I just sent home! 
    Princess Ember But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it! 
    Dragon Lord Torch Being smart won't help you win this Gauntlet! It was designed for a big, strong dragon to win, because it takes a big, strong dragon to lead! Besides, I said no! 
    Princess Ember  I hate when he does that! 
     
    "Prominence" Ha. When I become Dragon Lord, I will make burps an official greeting! 
    "Barry" Ha, you? Please! When I win, I will pillage Equestria for all their pillows. Why should these ponies be comfortable while we sleep on rocks? 
    Garble That's nothing! When I'm in charge, the first thing I'll do is get revenge on those puny ponies! They'll regret they ever crossed Garble! We'll take whatever we want from Equestria and burn the rest! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Oh, my gosh! 
    Rarity  Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins! 
    Spike None of them can win! Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge! 
    Twilight Sparkle But what can we do? 
    Spike There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it! I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Rarity Oh... 

    Rarity What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet? 
    Spike It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it! 
    Twilight Sparkle There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here! 
    Spike I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on! 

    Dragon Lord Torch I thought I released you, tiny one! 
    Spike I decided to compete. I am a dragon, after all. 
    Garble Are you sure? You can't even fly! 
     
    Dragon Lord Torch All dragons are welcome to compete, but they do so at their own peril! Flying to Flame-cano Island is the first of many challenges you will face in your quest to find the bloodstone scepter!  
     
    Garble Good luck! Just kidding. I hope you lose. 
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  Thanks, Garble! I was planning on swimming anyway! 
    Rarity You can do it, Spike! 
     
     
    Spike He's gonna drown! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
     
    Spike  

    Spike Hey, are you okay? 
    Princess Ember  
    Spike  Princess Ember! 
    Princess Ember What do you think you're doing? 
    Rarity Only saving your ungrateful scales! 
    Princess Ember Did that seaweed just talk? Ponies?! What are they doing here?! 
    Spike They're my friends! 
    Princess Ember Friends? Dragons don't do friends. 
    Spike Well, this dragon does. 
    Princess Ember Whatever. I don't care as long as none of you get in my way. I have a Gauntlet to win. 
    Spike But I thought your dad said thatâ€” 
    Princess Ember I don't care what my dad said! I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong! 
     
     
    Garble  Don't leave me here, Spike! 
    Spike  
    Garble Ha-ha! Knew you'd do it. Your pony friends made you soft. 
    Spike Uh-huh. You're welcome. 
    Garble For what? I didn't say thank you.  
    Princess Ember  Uh, that's just me. I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here. 
    Garble Huh, I like your style. Have I met you before? You kind of look likeâ€” 
    Spike My, uh, old neighbor! Uh, Sandy... Rockbeach! 
    Garble Stupid slingtails knocked me down! But I've wasted enough time making small talk. Get it? Ha-ha! Because you're too small to win this! I'm funny. 
    Princess Ember Why did you cover for me? You could've had one less competitor. 
    Spike I could ask you the same thing. You could've told Garble about my friends. 
     
     
    Princess Ember Yikes... That looks rough. But that's what makes it a challenge. 
    Spike Are you kidding? Those boulders are huge! Hey, what if we worked together? You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes! 
    Rarity Pssst! 
     
    Rarity  Spike! Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember? You don't know her too well. 
    Spike I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't. I think we can trust her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Her behavior does seem contradictory to everything I've noted about dragons so far. 
    Princess Ember Hey, you, little fella! I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense. Let's do it. 
    Spike Really? Great! It's a deal! 
    Princess Ember Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good luck. We'll meet you at the top. 

     
    Spike Pull up! There's one on your tail! 
    Princess Ember  
    Spike Go left! 

    Spike So what do we do now? 
    Princess Ember I think we go through there. 
     
     
    Rarity  Oh, that looks scary! I mean, you can do it! 
    Princess Ember Listen, Spike. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together. I mean, just until we get through that tunnel. 
    Spike Okay! 
    Twilight Sparkle  We'll be right behind you! 

     
    Garble  
     
    Garble  
     
    Spike  Oof! 
     
    Garble Urgh! 
     
    Garble  

    Rarity Oh, you made it! Oh, we were so worried! 
    Spike About us?  
     
    Princess Ember Wait. How did you two get through? 
     
    Rarity  
    Spike Rarity! 
    Rarity  Oh, thanks, Spike! 
    Spike  It was nothing. 
    Princess Ember Nothing? You just risked everything to save her! And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you! 
    Spike Well, that's just what friends do. Don't you have anyone who looks out for you? 
    Princess Ember Not really. Unless I count you.  Which I don't! Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it. 
    Spike Wait, what do you mean? 
    Princess Ember Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord. So I guess it's every dragon for themselves. 
    Spike Oh. So we aren't really friends? 
    Princess Ember Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship. 

    Spike I can't believe Ember ditched me. 
    Rarity  Oh, you're better off. She was only looking out for herself. She's just like all the other dragons. 
    Spike She's not, though. I know it. She saved me, even when she didn't have to. I don't care what she says. That makes us friends. 

    Twilight Sparkle Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already? 
    Spike It's kinda hard to tell. They all look the same. Except for this one! Look! We made it! I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far! 
    Garble You're not! And I'm not losing to a puny pony-loving dragon like you! 
    Rarity  We have to do something! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Look! 
     
    Garble  
    Spike  Ember! I thought it was every dragon for themselves! Why did you save me?! 
    Princess Ember That's what friends do! And I am. I mean, we are. I never should have left you back there. Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings! 
    Garble What the?!  
    Princess Ember Spike! Get the scepter!  
     
    Garble  Argh! Whoa! 
    Princess Ember  
     
     
    Garble  I'm sick and tired of you two helping each other! Dragons don't do helping! 
    Princess Ember These dragons do!  
     
     
    Spike  Whoa... 
     
     
     
    Spike Leave her alone! 
    Garble What? You?! You have the scepter?! But that means that you're... 
    Princess Ember The Dragon Lord. Dragon Lord Spike. 
    Garble  Dragon... Lord... Spike... 
    Spike That's right! Uh... Now, go start your long journey home. And give every dragon you see on the way a hug. Don't tell them why. 
    Garble Awww! But that'll be super embarrassing! 
    Spike I command you to do it! 
    Garble  I can't believe this... 
    Princess Ember Dragon Lord Spike. Hm, has a nice ring to it. 
    Spike Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better. 
    Princess Ember What? No. You're the Dragon Lord now. 
    Spike The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father! Besides, you'll make a great leader. I was just doing this to protect the ponies. But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have. 
    Princess Ember You sure about this? 
    Spike Absolutely. My home is in Equestria with my friends. 
    Princess Ember Well, you'll have at least one friend here too. What are you doing? 
    Spike It's called a hug! 
    Princess Ember Oh. I don't know if I like it. But... okay. 
    Spike Mmmmm! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Awww! 
    Rarity  

     
    Dragon Lord Torch Ember? You?! 
    Princess Ember I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did. 
    Dragon Lord Torch I expressly told you not to do it, because you're notâ€”! 
    Princess Ember I'm not big and strong. I know. But you know what? I won anyway. So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord! 
    Dragon Lord Torch I was wrong, Ember. You might not be big, but you are strong and smart, and perhaps that counts for more than I thought. And you will make an excellent leader. 
    Princess Ember Thanks, dad.  Agree with him! Just kidding! That's not gonna be my thing. 
    Dragon Lord Torch  Dragons, hear me! I present to you our new Dragon Lord, Ember! 
     
    Dragon Lord Torch  Hm? What is the meaning of this?! 
    Garble I can't tell you! 
    Princess Ember  

    Twilight Sparkle You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally. 
    Spike And a new friend! 
    Twilight Sparkle Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons! 
    Rarity And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing! I think I'll call it "Camo-Maud"! 
    Rarity, Twilight Sparkle and Spike  

     

No Second Prances

     
     
    Twilight Sparkle First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so thatâ€” Yikes! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Did you...?! How? When? What?! 
    Starlight Glimmer What? 
    Twilight Sparkle I said no magic, You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, I heard "set the table" and just kinda went for it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, if you hadn't used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives.  The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table. 
    Starlight Glimmer Should I... change it back? 
    Twilight Sparkle I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going! 
    Starlight Glimmer If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's the best part! You have to make a new friend! 
    Starlight Glimmer New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville! 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight! 
    Starlight Glimmer Kidding!  

     

    Starlight Glimmer Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard... 
    Pinkie Pie Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you! 

    Pinkie Pie Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake! 
     
    Mrs. Cake How are you, dearie? 
    Starlight Glimmer Are you baking? Can I help? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you! 
    Mrs. Cake  Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?! 
     
    Mrs. Cake  
    Starlight Glimmer Sorry... 
    Pinkie Pie  

     
     
    Applejack I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Applejack He's not much of a talker. 
    Big McIntosh Nnope. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation. 
     
    Big McIntosh  Make it stop! 
    Applejack  
    Starlight Glimmer I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk. 
    Applejack  
    Starlight Glimmer ...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to? 
    Applejack  
    Starlight Glimmer Alright, I'll change him back! 

    Rarity The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know. 
    Starlight Glimmer I'm glad you all got past my first impression. 
    Rarity Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath. 
    Starlight Glimmer You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies? 
    Rarity Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling! 
    Starlight Glimmer When will it be ready? 
    Rarity Three weeks. 
    Starlight Glimmer Dinner's tomorrow. 
    Rarity Well then, how about a hat from the...  ...clearance bin? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! Maybe not. 

    Rainbow Dash Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness. 
    Starlight Glimmer Like you? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, but you already know me, so...  Spitfire! Heh. Sorry. 
    Starlight Glimmer Who's that? 
    Rainbow Dash  Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you! 
     
    Rainbow Dash You coming or what? 
    Starlight Glimmer I guess my first question would be, "What's a Wonderbolt?" 
    Rainbow Dash  You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?! 
    Starlight Glimmer  Enslaving villages, I guess... 
    Rainbow Dash Right. 

    Angel  
    Starlight Glimmer You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind. 
    Fluttershy  

     
    Starlight Glimmer  Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  Stop stressing... Stop stressing! 
     
     

    Starlight Glimmer  This is just what I needed. 
    Trixie  Tell me about it. 
    Starlight Glimmer You ever have one of those days? 
    Trixie For me, they're all one of those days. 
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Trixie I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville. 
    Starlight Glimmer I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil? 
    Trixie Ponies judge me on my past too. 
    Starlight Glimmer Finally, a pony I can relate to. 

    Twilight Sparkle Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon, strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement!  
    Starlight Glimmer Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend! 
    Twilight Sparkle That's fantastic news! 
    Starlight Glimmer She's great! 
    Twilight Sparkle Great! 
    Starlight Glimmer She's powerful! 
    Twilight Sparkle Powerful? 
    Starlight Glimmer She'sâ€” 
    Trixie Hello... princess! 
    Twilight Sparkle Trixie?! 

    Starlight Glimmer You know each other? 
    Twilight Sparkle You could say that. 
    Trixie We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So, um, what brings you to Ponyville? 
    Trixie The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it "The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour"! 
    Starlight Glimmer  That's kind of a mouthful. 
    Trixie  It's a working title. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight? A moment? Over here?  I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend. 
    Starlight Glimmer But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you. 
    Twilight Sparkle  You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner. 
    Starlight Glimmer Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it! 
    Twilight Sparkle I hope not.  

    Trixie This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen! 
    Cherry Berry and Goldengrape  ...did you see...? 
    Caramel, Shoeshine, and Sunshower Raindrops  ...did you hear...? 
    Trixie Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget. 
    Starlight Glimmer That's what I'm worried about. 
    Trixie  
    Starlight Glimmer What is it? 
    Trixie I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends. 
    Starlight Glimmer Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel! 
    Trixie Can you keep a secret? 
    Starlight Glimmer What are friends for? 
    Trixie  The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something! 
    Starlight Glimmer  Your secret's safe with me. 
    Trixie Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon? 

    Trixie I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy. 
    Starlight Glimmer Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds... 
    Starlight Glimmer and Trixie  
    Twilight Sparkle Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh! 
    Starlight Glimmer Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof. 
    Trixie Sure. The wagon's right around the corner. 
    Twilight Sparkle  So, how's it going with your new friend? 
    Starlight Glimmer  Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way. 
    Twilight Sparkle Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  Nice to meet you. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, no! You can come out now! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh. 
    Starlight Glimmer So back at your castle when you said "I trust you", you meant "I don't trust you". 
    Twilight Sparkle  Can you? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you. 
    Starlight Glimmer  I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony. 
    Twilight Sparkle But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that? 
    Starlight Glimmer Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me. 
    Cranky Doodle Donkey  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh! Now he'd be perfect! 
    Starlight Glimmer  

     
     
    Starlight Glimmer I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic. 
    Trixie Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it. 
    Starlight Glimmer I meant stage magic. 
    Trixie Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do â€“ the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive! 
     
    Trixie  Only one magician has ever pulled it off â€“ my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage! 
     
    Trixie Completely unharmed! 
    Starlight Glimmer That sounds very... 
    Trixie Dangerous? 
    Starlight Glimmer I was gonna say cool! 
    Trixie I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore. 
    Starlight Glimmer Not if you could use real magic. 
    Trixie Obviously. Way to rub it in. 
    Starlight Glimmer No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you... 
     
    Starlight Glimmer ...and make you appear in the black box! 
    Trixie I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner. 
    Starlight Glimmer Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony! 
    Trixie We call it "assistant" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I'd be honored. 
    Trixie You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight! 
    Starlight Glimmer  I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight. 
    Trixie Oh. 
    Starlight Glimmer Can I vent for a minute? 
    Trixie What are friends for? 
    Starlight Glimmer Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends.  I guess you were right. No second chances. 
    Trixie Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand.  I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh, any minute, heh. Any minute now...  
    Cranky Doodle Donkey Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said "nosehair trimmers"! What's going on? I'm hungry! And my nose is too hairy.  
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Twilight Sparkle Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie. 

    Pinkie Pie So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour? 
    Applejack Ain't that a mouthful of molasses. 
    Trixie It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives. 
    Starlight Glimmer  I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?! 
    Starlight Glimmer Yes, butâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie. 
    Trixie A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ha! I win! 
    Starlight Glimmer You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight. 
    Trixie Exactly!  Saying that didn't help, did it? 
    Starlight Glimmer I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you?  
    Trixie Wait, it's not like that! I am your friend.  
    Twilight Sparkle Well, you won. I hope you're happy! 
    Trixie  Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show. 
    Twilight Sparkle Trixie? 
    Trixie ...Which is exactly the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces! 

     
    Trixie  Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's "Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour". 
     
    Trixie It's a working title!  Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore. 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Trixie  For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive. 
     
    Trixie  I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend! 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends. 
    Starlight Glimmer But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you? 
    Twilight Sparkle From what I've seen, she's the real thing. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you. 
     
     
    Trixie Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together!  Please? 
     
     
    Trixie  
     
     
    Fluttershy  
     
     
     
    Trixie  Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...! 
     
     
     
    Trixie  Starlight Glimmer! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Trixie! 
    Trixie What do you want? 
    Twilight Sparkle I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that. 
    Trixie Thank you, princess. 
     

     
    Cranky Doodle Donkey How do you get your hair to do that all the time? 
    Princess Celestia  

     

Newbie Dash

    Scootaloo Hey! Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up? 
    Scootaloo The Rainbow Dash Fan Club just decided â€“ everypony's coming to see you when the Wonderbolts' new tour comes through Ponyville! 
    Rainbow Dash Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it. Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly.  I'll probably be working crowd control or something. 
    Scootaloo You're still gonna be wearing a Wonderbolts uniform though, right? 
    Rainbow Dash A Reservist one, yeah. 
    Scootaloo Hmm. That's good enough for me. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Scootaloo Whoa! 
    Spitfire Rainbow Dash! Glad we found you. We need you in the show when we get to Ponyville. Flying. 
    Scootaloo But she's only in the Reserves! 
    Spitfire Not anymore, kid. 
    Rainbow Dash  You mean... 
    Scootaloo  Yeah, Rainbow Dash! Whoo! 
    Spitfire Heh. What she said. 

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, anypony seen my wing balm? I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters. 
    Spike Got it! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rarity Oh, yes, we must know every detail! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. Well, not much to tell, really. Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them. 
    Fluttershy That's really great. I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time. Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there. But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, I know! Pick me! 
    Rarity So what do you do now, Dashie? 
    Rainbow Dash I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon. It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine. 
     
    Pinkie Pie You're leaving already?!  But we barely started your congratulation party! I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville. I just have to train for this show. 
    Fluttershy I hope everything goes well. Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly. 
    Applejack Yeah. Good luck, Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash Luck? Heh. Save that for the rest of the team. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail! 
    Twilight Sparkle Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think. 
    Rainbow Dash Aw, you're right! I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not? Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on. Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't. 

     
    Spitfire Team briefings are every morning atâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash 0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.U.P. Guard that became the Wonderbolts! 
    Spitfire Right. And I know you've seen the academy bunks, but these are the official Wonderbolts barracks. 
    Rainbow Dash Built by Admiral Fairweather himself! 
     
    Spitfire Don't forget rule number one, newbie. Always check both ways before crossing the runway. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, sure, but... nopony else is here. 
    Spitfire They will be, and most of the Wonderbolts like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert. 
    Rainbow Dash Right, no problem! 

    Rainbow Dash Whoa! Is that General Flash's cap?! 
    Spitfire And the original crest with the Wonderbolts motto on it. 
    Rainbow Dash and Spitfire "Altius volantis! Soaring higher!" 
    Rainbow Dash Wow!  I mean, ha, cool. 
    Spitfire Okay, newbie, we've got a show in two days, which means you gotta hustle your haunches to learn this routine. You got five minutes to get dressed and get outside to meet the rest of the team. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am! I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day! 
    Spitfire Let's hope so. We're all expecting you to make quite an impression. 
     

    Rainbow Dash Lookin' good! Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt.  Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves. Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever! 

     
     
    Spitfire Hey, look out! 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? Whooaaa! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Misty Fly Whoa, most awesome entrance by a newbie ever. 
    Soarin Are you okay, Rainbow Dash? 
    Fleetfoot More like Rainbow Crash. 
     

    Young Rainbow Dash Okay, flight school! Get ready for Rainbow Dash! Hahâ€”whooooa! 
     
    Young Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Young Hoops More like Rainbow Crash! 
     
    Young Hoops and Young Pegasi Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! 

    Rainbow Dash Hey! You guys buzzed me on purpose! 
    Spitfire Not quite. You forgot rule number one, newbie. 
    Surprise, Fleetfoot, High Winds, Misty Fly and Soarin Always check both ways before crossing the runway. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well, I was just... testing you guys! 
    Wonderbolts  
    Spitfire Alright, nopony got hurt and we got a lot to do, so let's forget about this and get flying! 
    Misty Fly Classic rookie move, Rainbow Crash. That was amazing. 

     
    Spitfire  Higher, Crash! You're breaking formation! 

    Soarin Check your nine, Crash! 

    Spitfire Tighter, Crash, get in there! 
    Rainbow Dash  My name's not Crash! 
     
    Rainbow Dash and Surprise  
    Surprise Huh, could've fooled me. 

     
    Fleetfoot Hey, Crash, I know it was a tough day today, but don't worry. You'll get the hang of it. 
    Rainbow Dash Tough day? Please. If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine. I'll have it down cold tomorrow. Probably even come up with a couple of improvements. 
    Spitfire Rainbow Dash, over here! 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire I'm glad you're still here. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah? Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome? 
    Spitfire Not quite. I know you've been a Reservist for a while, but the 'Bolts have a few of their own rules you might not know about. Like worst flyer of the day has to clean up the whole compound. Better get to it, Crash. 
    Rainbow Dash  My name's not Crash. 

     
     
    Rest of main cast and Cutie Mark Crusaders Surprise! 
    Rainbow Dash What? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Hooray, Rainbow Dash! Our favorite Wonderbolt! 
    Twilight Sparkle We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party. 
    Pinkie Pie Your best day  ever party! 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah. It was somethin', all right. 
    Applejack Well we can't wait to hear all about it! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat.  You know, from all the... excitement of my big day? 
    Fluttershy Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash What could be wrong? I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome. 
    Rarity Oh, no. Something is wrong. What happened, darling? 
    Rainbow Dash I told you, it's nothing! I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash... 
    Fluttershy Oh, no! Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle Why would they call you that? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I kinda sorta fell into a garbage can.  
    Twilight Sparkle Urgh. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, look at the bright side! At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash! 
    Applejack So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day. 
    Rarity Mmm-hmm! What you need is to find a positive way to stand out. As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways. 
    Rainbow Dash That's it! I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys! Goodbye, Rainbow Crash; hello, Captain Awesome! 
     

    Rainbow Dash  Good morning, everypony! Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying? I know I am! I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Actually, I'm always excited! Some ponies even call me "Dynamic Dash"! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fleetfoot Uh, Wonderbolts don't get excited, Crash. You gotta keep a level head to fly the way we do. 
    Rainbow Dash  Well, of course I know that! But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited! It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts! And here you all are doin' it! 
    Fleetfoot So are you. 
    Rainbow Dash  True! Go ahead and call me "Forthright Filly" if you want. But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special! 
    Misty Fly We know. 
     

     
    Rainbow Dash  You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns. It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  I'm always finding so much interesting information in books. In fact, a lot of ponies call me "Reading Rainboom". 
    Spitfire  We all know how wings work, newbie! And we already have checklists! Now get off the runway! 
    Rainbow Dash  Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later... 
    Spitfire  
    Rainbow Dash  Or, you know, not at all... 
     

     
    Rainbow Dash  I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms. Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours. They don't call me "Rainbow Fash" for nothing. 
    Soarin Uhhhh... huh...? 
    Rainbow Dash  The "Fash" is for "Fashion". 
    Spitfire Crash! I'm not sure why you're acting like this, but you need to stop. 
    Rainbow Dash I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts. 
    Spitfire I know you're excited to find your place on the team, but just focus on the routine for now, okay? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes, ma'am. 
    Spitfire Maybe this will help motivate you. 
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Crash?! Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?! 
    Spitfire That's not how it works around here. We all have our nicknames on our jackets. Right, Clipper? 
    Rainbow Dash Clipper? 
    Soarin Right, boss! 
     
    Spitfire Now it's official. Welcome to the Wonderbolts, Crash!  
     
    Rainbow Dash  If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life! 
     

    Scootaloo This is gonna be so amazing! 
    Spike I know! I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt! I hope there's cotton candy! 
     
    Fluttershy We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too. 
    Rarity Excellent point. It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now! 
    Applejack Speakin' of... Hey, Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Perfect! Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo Me? What for? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job! 
    Twilight Sparkle I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff. But don't worry! With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome. Better than awesome! 
    Rarity Does... Does that mean practice went well yesterday? 
    Rainbow Dash Gotta go. 

    Scootaloo What are we doing up here, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special. Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show. I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path! 
    Scootaloo What? 
    Rainbow Dash That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome! And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen! 
    Scootaloo Are you sure about this? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh-huh! It's gonna be so awesome! And nopony will ever call me "Rainbow Crash" after this! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, gotta go! Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo? 
    Scootaloo Um... okay...? 

    Announcer  Mares and gentlecolts, fillies and foals of all ages! Look to the skies and prepare to be awestruck by the incredible flying prowess of... the Wonderbolts! 
     
     
    Fluttershy I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash! 
    Rarity Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy. Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this! 
    Applejack Heh. Except maybe cotton candy. 

     
    Spike Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting! 
    Pinkie Pie One second! Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry! Bigger! 

     
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle That was amazing! She's doing great! 

    Pinkie Pie Bigger! 
     
    Spike  

     
     
    Scootaloo I hope this works. 
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Crowd  
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Hope I'm not too late.  I dunno what took that pony so long. 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie That was amazing! 
    Spitfire Way to go, Rainbow Crash. 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Spitfire You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie? 
    Rainbow Dash  I'm so sorry. 
    Spitfire I should hope so. You changed the routine without consulting me and put other ponies at risk. I've drummed flyers out of the 'Bolts for less. 
    Rainbow Dash I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want. You guys were right to call me "Rainbow Crash". I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes.  It's been my dream my whole life, but... I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all. 
    Soarin Are you serious?! You're the most talented flyer we've ever had! 
    Fleetfoot And you've saved all of Equestria like, a dozen times. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, Iâ€” 
    Spitfire Of course you're supposed to be a Wonderbolt. We've been waiting for a spot to open up ever since you joined the Reserves! 
    Rainbow Dash But... you guys all called me Rainbow Crash. 
    Soarin Yeah, so? My nickname's "Clipper". You know why they call me that? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... 'cause you're as fast as a ship? 
    Soarin Because I clipped my wing on a flagpole as I was landing on my first day. Heh. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh. 
    Fleetfoot "Flatfoot". My first day, I misjudged my landing and came down right on Spitfire's hoof. 
    Misty Fly "Dizzy". 
    Surprise "Slowpoke". 
    High Winds "Hoof-in-Mouth". 
    Spitfire You don't wanna know what they call me.  
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! That is so much worse than Crash. 
    Spitfire Right? 
    Rainbow Dash So does this mean I'm... still on the team? 
    Spitfire Do you think you can be part of this team and not constantly try to showboat? 
    Rainbow Dash I promise! I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in! 
    Spitfire Good, because I really didn't want to miss the chance to tease you for years about this catastrophe! I mean, that crash was epic! 
     
    Spitfire But you're on probation for a month. Got a problem with that?! 
    Rainbow Dash  No, ma'am. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay? 
    Rainbow Dash I'm doing great, thanks! 
    Scootaloo Sure you don't need any help? 
    Rainbow Dash Nah. This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself. And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month. 
    Scootaloo So why are you in such a good mood? 
    Rainbow Dash Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!

        Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again! 

    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville? 
    Starlight Glimmer I was thinking I might just skip it. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike  

     

    Spike Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?! 
    Starlight Glimmer I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it? 
    Spike And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk! 
    Twilight Sparkle I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history. 
    Starlight Glimmer I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet! 
    Starlight Glimmer Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not that one. My favorite holiday story, "A Hearth's Warming Tale"! 
    Spike Oh, I love that one! 

    Twilight Sparkle This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot... 

    Twilight Sparkle  Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportationâ€” 
    Spike  We get it. Star Swirl's awesome. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant. 
    Rainbow Dash What do you need? 
    Starlight Glimmer Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration! 
    Rainbow Dash  Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea? 
    Starlight Glimmer Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria. 
    Rainbow Dash Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos! 
    Starlight Glimmer That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that "singing songs and being nice" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works. 
    Rainbow Dash I think you might be missing the point. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony.  But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the restâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Sweet! 
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer I hate Hearth's Warming Eve! All of Equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether. 

    

        Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street 
        Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet 
        Words said so often that they lack any meaning 
        Why should I join in when I could be intervening? 

        Everypony loves this cursed holiday 
        But would they be better off with it out of the way? 
        Well, okay 

        Say goodbye to the holiday 
        With my magic, I'll erase it 
        The greatest gift that I give today 
        And everypony will have to face it 

        No more little games for you to play 
        After you say goodbye to the holiday 

        Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, you had a good run 
        Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, it's over, you're done 
        Finally set free from your forced celebrations 
        No need to reply to your trite invitations 

        Calendar shorter by a single day 
        Is my magic up to the test? 
        Time to see, I can't delay 

        Say goodbye to the holiday 
        Prepare the spell, no hesitation 
        All memory shall fade away 
        See Equestria's new transformation 

        No more shall anypony say 
        Happy Hearth's Warming... 
         
        ...after today! 

        After today... 

    Starlight Glimmer Once the spell is cast, all of Equestria will be better off, and they'll have me to thank for it! 

    Starlight Glimmer Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are. 
    Spike Proceed. 
    Twilight Sparkle Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time... 

    Twilight Sparkle  ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention. 
    Applejack You sure you wanna go through with this? 
    Starlight Glimmer Huh?! Who's there?! 
     
    Applejack The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat. 
    Starlight Glimmer A spirit?!  I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here? 
    Applejack You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours. 
    Starlight Glimmer "We"? 
    Applejack They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it. 
    Starlight Glimmer I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve. 
    Applejack We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you. 
    Starlight Glimmer  

    

        As a young thing, life sure is somethin' 
        You go makin' choices large and small 
        Always growin' like a seedlin' 
        And playin' is like dreamin' 
        And before you know it, big and tall 

        And every little bitty choice you make 
        Sends you down a path to who you are today 
        So let's take a little trip down memory lane 
        And see just what the past has to say 

    Aw, look how cute you were. Looks like you're not too upset it's Hearth's Warming Eve either. 

        The seeds of the past 
        They grow pretty fast 
        Just look at who you were back then 
        The seeds, as they grow 
        Look what they can show 
        Reveal the truth time and again 

    Professor Flintheart Just what do you think you're doing, Snowfall? 
    Young Starlight Glimmer Decorating the classroom for Hearth's Warming Eve, Professor Flintheart! 
    Professor Flintheart You said you wanted to learn to be a powerful unicorn, did you not? 
    Young Starlight Glimmer I do! 
    Professor Flintheart And what is the way that one becomes a powerful unicorn? 
    Young Starlight Glimmer  Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. 
    Professor Flintheart And how do these help you to learn magic? 
    Young Starlight Glimmer I want to be strong enough to stop windigos and help ponies! 
    Professor Flintheart That's just a story we tell little ponies. Real magic takes time to learn. 
     
    Professor Flintheart It's your choice. Spend your time learning to become a powerful unicorn or play with your toys and make nothing of yourself. 

    

        Then some distress, words so careless 
        Standin' there, you don't know what to do 
        Feelin' helpless, you can't make it hurt less 
        So you go and change your point of view 

        And in that moment, though you didn't know it 
        Your defenses set up walls you built to last 
        Leading to the pony you've become today 
        And the spell you're about to cast 
        It all comes from your past 

    

        The seeds of the past 
        We grow up so fast 
        Some hurts never go away 

    

        The seeds, as they grow 
        This we can't let go 
        All tied to this one holiday 

     
    Starlight Glimmer  Spirit? What am I supposed toâ€” 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Snowfall Frost! It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents! 
    Starlight Glimmer Um, don't you mean "Present", like the time? 
    Pinkie Pie No! Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake? 
    Starlight Glimmer Fine, "Presents". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means! 
    Starlight Glimmer It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff! 
    Pinkie Pie Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means "I love you!" Or a toy means "Hi, how're you doing?" Sometimes a book means "Your mane looks amazing!" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy. 
    Starlight Glimmer I don't understand anything you're saying. 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! Whoa!  
    Starlight Glimmer What's happening to you?! 
    Pinkie Pie My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off! That means a song is coming on! 

    

        Take a look at everything around you 
        All the smells that surely will astound you 
        Open up your heart, it will surround you 
        In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve 

        The little things that make it better 
        Little ponies spreading cheer 
        Give a toy, a hug, a sweater 
        Memories that last all year 

        The present's always filled with presents 
        Large, medium, and small 
        Sometimes the most important things 
        Aren't very big at all 

         

        What a party, there's so much to see here 
        Can't believe you didn't want to be here 
        You'd have had a blast, I guarantee here 
        This is the spirit of Hearth's Warming Eve 

        Cider's flowing, this is living 
        Come on and feel the beat 
        Life is better when you're giving 
        Each time you do it feels so sweet 

        The present's always filled with presents 
        So come on, open your eyes 
        Spend time with ponies just like you 
        And watch your spirits rise 

        The present's always filled with presents 
        Take a look around 
        The reason for the holiday 
        Is quite easily found 
        Yes, the reason for the holiday 
        Is quite easily found 

        And the reason is to be with your friends! 

    Twilight Sparkle  What? 
    Starlight Glimmer You know you're doing your Pinkie Pie voice, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle I was not! 
    Spike  
    Starlight Glimmer So, what happens next? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, the party wasâ€” 
    Spike Wait! Can we take a quick break? I need to refill my cocoa. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Fine. But hurry up! We're almost to the best part! 

    Spike  Okay, I'm ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle The party was in full swing. 

    Rarity Snowdash! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Merry. 
    Rarity Why, whatever is the matter, darling? 
    Fluttershy Was it the eggnog? Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is. 
    Rarity I don't suppose that pony's name starts with "Snow"? 
    Fluttershy And ends with "Frost"? 
    Rainbow Dash She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place. 
    Crowd  
    Rarity What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like? 
    Rainbow Dash Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria. 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
     
     
    Rarity  It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here. 
    Fluttershy I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party. 
    Pinkie Pie Me too! Too bad it's going to be the last one ever! Ever! Ever! Ever!  
    Starlight Glimmer Spirit? What do you mean? What's going to happen?! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Who are you? 
    Princess Luna I am the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come. 
    Starlight Glimmer Are you here to show me what future Hearth's Warming Eves are like? 
    Princess Luna No, for there are no more Hearth's Warming Eves for me to show. 
    Starlight Glimmer Why not? 
    Princess Luna You will succeed in erasing the holiday, as you wished. 
    Starlight Glimmer And what happens? 

    

        I see a cold wind blowing through 
        I see days neither fun nor free 
        I see a future caused by you 
        I see a path not meant to be 

        The future should be filled with magic 
        Dreams and wishes brought to life 
        But the days ahead are dark and tragic 
        No time for hope when all is strife 

        Whatever might have been 
        All the dreams that ponies share 
        Because of you, Snowfall Frost 
        Now the future is a cold nightmare 

    Starlight Glimmer Windigos?! They aren't real! It's just a little filly's story! 
    Princess Luna They are all too real, Snowfall, and your actions will allow them to return. The future of Equestria shall be bathed in a blanket of eternal snow! 
    Starlight Glimmer No! I never meant for this to happen! I didn't understand! I didn't see how important Hearth's Warming Eve was! Please, spirit! I haven't cast the spell yet! Is there still time?! I'm sorry!  
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer There's still time! 

     
     
     
    Rarity Oh, my. 
    Fluttershy Snowfall Frost? 
    Starlight Glimmer I was hoping I wasn't too late for the party? I brought gifts. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Boss?! 
    Starlight Glimmer I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often our friends. 
    Rainbow Dash Wow. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks? 
    Starlight Glimmer I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time. 
    Rainbow Dash Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog! 
    Twilight Sparkle  And from then on, it was always said of all the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations, Snowfall's was the Hearth's Warmingest. 

    Twilight Sparkle The end. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, that's it! Thanks for letting me read you the story. Guess you can call it a night. Spike and I are heading downstairs, and if you wanted to, you'd be welcome to join us. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Welcome to the party! Happy Hearth's Warming, Starlight. 
    Starlight Glimmer Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight. 

    

        Hearth's Warming Eve is filled with presents 
        Some take you by surprise 
        A story shared by your good friends 
        That makes your spirits rise 

        Sometimes you just let go of the past 
        Enjoy the present while it lasts 
        And really it's not that much to ask 
        With good friends by your side 

        Now it's time to celebrate 

    

        Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again 

    

        All together, feeling great 

    

        Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again 

    

        Can hardly wait 
        We'll party 'til late 
        Our favorite date 

    

        Hearth's Warming Eve is here once aâ€” 
        Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve 
        Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve 
        Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again! 

     

The Saddle Row Review

    Rainbow Dash  Come on! If we hurry, we can get there before the paper's even delivered to Rarity's house! 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe she won't read the article. 
    Applejack I'm pretty sure Rarity's gonna read a review of her new boutique in Manehattan. 
    Rainbow Dash I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter! 
    Fluttershy I just hope it doesn't end up being an article about how her friends almost ruined the opening. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think you're all overreacting. Rarity's our friend. If anypony is gonna understand, it'll be her. 
     
    Rarity  I was wondering when all of you were going to show up. 
    Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy  
    Rarity  Now we can all read the review together! 
    Rainbow Dash Um, I have an idea. How 'bout we don't read it? 
    Twilight Sparkle What she means is, before you read it, we should probably tell you aboutâ€” 
    Rarity No, no, darling. Please, no spoilers. 
    Fluttershy Butâ€” 
    Rarity No spoilers! 

     

    Rarity Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You? 
     
    Rarity  "Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!" 
    Fluttershy I wish it had been more fettered. 
    Rarity Oh, uh...  "...Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!" 

    Buried Lede Okay, kid, ya successfully opened a shop in Manehattan and that's no mean feat! Most ponies might wonder what it feels like. Here's how it's gonna be I'm gonna interview you and your friends so I can paint a picture of how it all came together. A word picture, mind you, not an actual picture. Any questions? 
    Rarity Well, I was wonderingâ€” 
    Buried Lede Let's get started! Ms. Rarity, you've got shops all over Equestria, but this was your first time trying to make it in the big city. What made ya think you could tackle it on your own? 
    Rarity Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria. I just have two other boutiques one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot. Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again. Heh. 

    Pinkie Pie Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever... 

    Applejack It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster! 

    Rainbow Dash After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Wait, are you writing this down? 

    Fluttershy Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right. 

    Rarity Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria! 
    Applejack If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium? 
    Rarity I suppose it didn't make the cut.  Here it is! Rarity For You! 

     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, it's lovely. But are you sure you'll be ready to open tonight? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation. My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little... dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight. 
    Mr. Stripes Rarity! So good to see you! Your store, it's going to be a very good place, I think!  

    Rarity Mr. Stripes owns the building. He's a very pleasant landlord. Although he can be pushy at times.  Okay, all the time. 

    Mr. Stripes You've met my daughter, the apple of my ear, the hay in my hoof? You will let her work with you. 
    Rarity  It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see. 
    Mr. Stripes There are only two things I love more than being pushy. One is my daughter. The other is miniature doll furniture. And I would sell my entire mini-furniture collection to make my daughter happy. You understand? 
     
    Rarity I'm sorry. I just don't think it's going to be possible. 
    Mr. Stripes Let me say another way... Hire her or I raise rent until you no can afford! 
    Rarity Oh, uh, welcome aboard. 
    Plaid Stripes  But they glow in the dark! 
    Rarity Golly, what a splendid idea!  

    Rarity Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?! 

    Rarity Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste! 
    Fluttershy Aw, hello. 
    Rarity But what are they doing here? 
     
    Fluttershy Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan. 

    Fluttershy Then Smoky Jr. found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building. But Mr. Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live. 

    Rarity No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique! 
     
    Rarity Uh, did you hear that? 

    Rarity  Heh. Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs. 

    Pinkie Pie  Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs! 

     
    Rarity I'm sorry. Could you please ask her to turn it down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please?  Oh, please! 

    Rarity Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called "music" far too loud. I realize that makes me sound like an old mare. But this is business! 

     
     
    Rainbow Dash I wish we were having as much fun as they are. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, sweeping can be fun, too.  Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep... 

    Rainbow Dash Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping. I mean, how lame is that? 
    Applejack Yeah. It wasn't even catchy. 
    Rainbow Dash Nope. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle  Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep... 
    Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack  Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep... 
    Rarity Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her. 
     
    Rarity Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?! 

    Plaid Stripes You know how most stores have a little jingle-bell when the door opens? Ahem. I thought we should have something with a little more pizzazz! So, I installed one of Daddy's antique horns. 

     
    Rarity  We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display! 
     
    Rarity Ahh! Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville? It's completely disorganized! Aâ€”Aâ€”...  
    Coco Pommel  
    Rarity Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought. 
    Coco Pommel Actually, Iâ€”  I can't work tonight. 
    Rarity Oh? Why not? 

    Coco Pommel  

    Coco Pommel  
    Rarity Feel better, my sweet. We'll manage without you... somehow. And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything? 
     
    Rarity  What am I going to do?! 

    Twilight Sparkle Well, opening a store in Manehattan is a pretty big deal. It's natural that Rarity would be a little stressed about how it was going. Since it wasn't going well. Still, I think she handled it all right. 

    Rarity My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before. If we all work togetherâ€” 
    Rarity I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan. To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect. The perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening! 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe we should just postpone. 
    Rarity Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season. If we don't open tonight, it won't be... 
    Twilight Sparkle  Perfect. 
    Rarity Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself! 

    Pinkie Pie Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle We can do this. And we can stay true to your vision. 
    Rarity You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those... strong-smelling raccoons for me? 
    Fluttershy Of course. 
    Applejack Leave Plaid Stripes to me. I'll handle her and her, uh, "good ideas". 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons andâ€” 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie And then make them be quiet. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm pretty sure I know somepony who wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you.  Oh, please, let me organize it! 
    Rarity This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best. 
    Rainbow Dash Leave the hiring to me. 
    Rarity Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you? 

    Rainbow Dash What would she do without us? Huh. Lemme think.  Heh, I sound just like her! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, you're not writing this down, are you? 

    Rarity Now for the perfect window display. Hmm. 

     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would Rarity want?! 
    Rarity Devil Keep that party going 'til the break of dawn! 
    Pinkie Pie Really? 
    Rarity Angel Indubitably! And as for the roof, get jiggy! Raise it, Pinkie! Raise it like you've never raised it before! 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! If you say so! 
    Rarity Devil Oh, please, Pinkie Pie. Never in a million years would I say such balderdash! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats. I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene!  I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think. 
     
     
    Dancers Awww. 

    Rainbow Dash Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best. And to me, that means the fastest. Now, uh, before we begin, uh...  New plan! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is? 
    Blue Bobbin That's organza. 
    Rainbow Dash Are you sure? 
    Blue Bobbin It's a thin, plain weave. Sheer fabric traditionally made from silk, so... yeah. 

    Rainbow Dash I don't know the first thing about clothes. Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not. This chair? Not clothes. 

    Plaid Stripes See if you can keep up with me here. What are all clothes made of? 
    Applejack Uh, fabric? 
    Plaid Stripes Bingo! But not in this store. Uh-uh. Not anymore. 
    Applejack Oh, no? 
    Plaid Stripes Two words for you "spoon clothes". All our clothes will be made of spoons! 
    Applejack  You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes. If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium. But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no. 

    Applejack Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. Useful, too. Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes. 

    Twilight Sparkle There. Perfect. Although, what would Rarity want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color. Guess I have to start over! 

    Fluttershy Hello, Smoky, Softpad, Smoky Jr.? I have some... interesting news. I, oh... I'd like you all to stay here forever, but...  
     

    Rarity A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique. 

    Rainbow Dash  I don't know which one of you to hire! Just... keep guessing fabrics! 
    Plaid Stripes Daddy, Rarity's friend doesn't like my ideas! 
    Mr. Stripes Spoon clothes is good idea! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup! 
     
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Rarity How's itâ€” 
     
    Rarity Ooh! 

    Fluttershy When you write the story, could you maybe skip over the part where we locked Rarity in the window display?  

    Rarity Hello? The door appears to be stuck! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yep. We're workin' on it! 
    Rarity Hmm. Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle How did this happen? 
    Pinkie Pie I shut down the party. 
    Applejack I told Plaid Stripes no. 
    Fluttershy I asked the raccoons to leave. 
    Rainbow Dash I asked a lot of fabric questions. 
    Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Just like I thought Rarity would want! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity asked us to help her with everything because she knows all of us so well.  Maybe we should all do the same. Doing this our way is what Rarity wants. It's not too late. Let's all dig in and we can fix this. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Before Rarity finds out how bad we messed up. 

    Fluttershy I'm sorry I asked you to leave. The place is yours if you wanna stay. Though I would like to ask you all just one favor. 

    Pinkie Pie I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun, super-boring music. But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the party even better! 

    Rainbow Dash Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed. And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have. So... first one to the river and back gets the job!  It's a race! Go! 

    Applejack  Mr. Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology. She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance. So here's what I'm thinkin'. 

     

    Rarity Perfect! 
     
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time! 
    Rarity  Oh! What's all this? 

    Twilight Sparkle The whole place organized by style, cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric. She'll be able to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work. 

    Rarity Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right... I suppose this is the moment of truth... 
     
    Rarity Rarity For You is now open! 
     
    Rarity Oh, dear. I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd. How will I handle them all? 
    Blue Bobbin My name's Blue Bobbin. I'll be your personal shopping assistant this evening. 
    Rainbow Dash Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out! 

    Rainbow Dash Honestly, they were all pretty slow. But they finished the race. Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did. So, I hired them all! 

     

    Pinkie Pie The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats. What better combination than a boutique/dance club? 

    Fluttershy After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help! 
     

    "Waxton" Ah, a blue corn reduction with shallot confit! But how can I possibly enjoy it without aâ€” 
    Plaid Stripes Spoon? 

    Applejack Heh. Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. 

    "Waxton"  Mmm! Exquisite! This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen! 
     

    Rarity  Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems? 
    Twilight Sparkle We all figured you had enough on your mind. 
    Applejack And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect. 
    Rarity  "Ne'er-do-wells" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that. 

    Plaid Stripes  

     

Applejack's "Day" Off

     
    Rarity  
    Aloe Um... Miss Rarity? Eh, how much longer are you planning to stay in here, darling? 
    Rarity Oh, dear. Is somepony else waiting? 
    Aloe Oh, no, no. I just don't want you to get all... What is word? Pruney. 
    Rarity Oh. Uh, well, I'm just waiting for Applejack. It's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together. I'm quite certain she'll be along any moment. 
     
     

     
    Applejack Hey, there, Rarity. I really tried to get here earlier. I just can't believe how much time my chores are takin' up these days. At least now we'll finally get to spend some quality spa time together. Right? 
    Aloe Okay, fillies, that's it. We are closing up for the day. 
     
    Applejack Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess I missed the whole day. I sure am sorry. 
    Rarity Me, too. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle Hi, Rarity! 
    Rarity Morning, Twilight, Spike. Good heavens, that's a lot of empty pie plates. 
    Spike Uh... yeah. We were just heading to pick up some fresh pies. Heh. I don't know why we keep running out at the castle.  What are you gonna get? 
    Rarity Applejack, actually. Although, I'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you mean? 
    Rarity Oh, nothing. It's just that Applejack and I haven't had one of our spa days in ages. 
    Twilight Sparkle You two really should set aside some time. 
    Rarity Darling, I have been trying for moons! But Applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow. I didn't realize Applejack had so much to do. 

     
     
     
    Spike Hey, Applejack! Another order of pies, please. 
    Applejack Sure thing, Spike! 
    Spike Aah! Dah! Whoa-oa-oa! 
    Rarity I don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today? 
    Applejack Gah! Land's sakes! Is it time for our spa day already? Rarity, why don't you go on ahead and I'll meet ya there? 
    Rarity Oh! Please, Applejack, let's not kid ourselves! 
    Applejack Well, it ain't 'cause I don't wanna. But the work on the farm has just been takin' up more and more of my time. 
    Twilight Sparkle I hate seeing you two not spending time together. Can't you get somepony else in your family to take over for a bit? 
    Applejack  Wish I could. But Granny, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom all have chores of their own. And today, they're all busy takin' the harvest to market. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know we're not farmers, but I'm sure Spike and I could handle things for a little while. 
    Applejack Maybe... 
    Twilight Sparkle Is there one chore we could do? 
    Applejack Well... I suppose if you two got started on feedin' the pigs, I could maybe leave for an hour. 
    Rarity Oooh! An hour of spa perfection? I can work with that! 
    Twilight Sparkle Perfect! You head out to the spa, and Spike and I'll take care of things here. 
     
    Spike Whoa! Dah! Whoa! 
     
    Spike Uh, yeah. We totally got everything covered. 

    Applejack  Okay. This list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs. But, uh, maybe I should go over it with you just to... 
    Twilight Sparkle Applejack, please. If there's a list involved, I am one hundred percent on top of it. 
    Applejack Uh, right. 
    Twilight Sparkle And don't worry about things here! Spike and I have totally got this! I mean, it's just feeding the pigs. How hard could it be? 
    Spike Uh, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa. 

    Applejack I'm glad we're doin' this, Rarity. I've been puttin' work before our spa time for too long. I know we've only got an hour, but I can't wait to have a steam. 
    Rarity A steam is just the start. I know exactly what we'll do, and an hour will be perfect. 

    Twilight Sparkle Okay, Spike, ready with that list? 
    Spike Ready. 
    Twilight Sparkle Let's do this! 
    Spike  "Step one open the gate." 
     
     
    Spike Okay.  "Step two close the gate." 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? 
    Spike Mm. That's what it says. 
     
    Spike  "Step three walk away." 
    Twilight Sparkle "Walk away"? Really? 
    Spike  Mmm. 

    Applejack I just hope Twilight and Spike can handle things until I get back. 
    Rarity Now, Applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together, you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off-duty and try to relax. 
    Applejack I know. You're right. I really am glad we're doin' this. And as long as it's only an hour, I'm sure everythin' will be just fine. 
    Rarity Exactly. Now kindly step this way. Relaxation awaits. 

     
     
    Rarity  Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here?! 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Applejack Yeah. I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, they're totally not. At least, not the froufrou kind. 
    Rarity Ah. 
    Applejack Huh. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day. I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage. 
    "Lavender Essence" Ah, Miss Dash, I am so sorry, but we are running just a tad behind, and we are not quite ready to start your pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure just yet. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh!  I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for. 
    "Lavender Essence" But they are your usual. 
    Rainbow Dash And it seems like you're really busy today anyway! I'll just come back tomorrow.  But put me down for the same thing. 
     
    Applejack  Too bad Rainbow Dash just hates those "froufrou" spa treatments. She could have joined us for a nice steam. Hoo-wee! I can't wait. 
    Rarity  Indeed. Although, if they couldn't fit Dashie in, I wonder just how far behind things are running. Obviously, we're on a very tight schedule. 
     
    Rarity  Well, maybe not everypony is waiting for the steam room. 
    Caramel Oh, no. No, that's exactly what we're waiting for. Oh, I hope you're not in a hurry. 

    Applejack So everypony here wants a steam bath? 
     
    Rarity Well, the solution is obvious. We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else. 
    Applejack  Nothin' doin'. I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get! 
    Rarity But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line! 
    Aloe RRRRarity! My favorite customer! Mwah! Mwah! And Appleyack? Well, it certainly has been a long time since you two were here together! So lovely to have you back. 
    Rarity Well, I wish I could say the same. 
    Aloe Yes, the wait time for the steam room certainly has been getting worse lately. But I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate your usual treatments. 
    Applejack Not without my steam! 
    Rarity Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour. 
    Aloe That is a problem. 
    Rarity Applejack, where are you going? 

     
    Applejack Um, why are y'all just standin' here? 
    Buddy Ugh! Just waiting for the steam to build up. 
    Spoiled Rich Without steam, a steam room's just a room, and I've got plenty of those at home. Because I live in a mansion. 
     
    Aloe It has been taking longer for the steam to reach the Ponyville Day Spa quality. We even had to add a warm towel service. So sorry for the delay, everypony. Please help yourselves. 
    Applejack So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water. 
    Rarity Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? We're going to run out of time. 

    Applejack Hmm. 
     
     
    Applejack Ha! Now what do we have here? 
    Rarity The laundry room, of course. And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss! 
    Aloe The Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on sanitary conditions, and fresh linens are integral part. 
    Applejack Well, sure, but have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore all day, every day? 
    "Birch Bucket" The answer is no. But ponies sure do love the warm towel service. 
    Applejack Hmmm. 

    "Birch Bucket" Eh, you are all wanting towel? 
    Applejack Looks to me like you don't have any left. 
    "Birch Bucket" Well, like I said, warm towels are big hit. 
     
    Applejack I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness. 
    "Birch Bucket" Eh, what? 
    Applejack Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse. 
    Ponies  
    Aloe Ah! I had no idea. 
    Rarity Wonderful. Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our... significantly less than an hour of relaxation. 
    Applejack Rarity, are you kiddin'? I can't just leave things like this. I'm gonna need my tools. 
    Rarity  

     

     
    Rarity Ahh! 
    Applejack Whew! Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels! And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want! 
    "Birch Bucket" And I only have to be doing vash once a day! 
     
    Aloe Wow, Appleyack! Have you ever considered a career in the spa industry? I'm sure I can find something for you. 
    Applejack  No, thanks. I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam. What do you say, Rarity? 
    Rarity It sounds lovely, Applejack, but... unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room, we don't have any time left to use it. Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks? 
    Aloe There's just so many other things to worry about! I suppose ve get used to the way things are, and ve don't realize there vas problem. 
    Rarity You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation. It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax! 
    Applejack Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity. We'll just have to do this another day. Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now. 
    Rarity Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next. 
    Applejack Look, I know Twilight's a princess and an Alicorn, but she isn't a farmer. I've been doin' farm work my whole life, and I'm not sure it's somethin' you can just "figure out". 
    Rarity Of course.  Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off? 
    Applejack Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far. 
    Rarity  Oh, Applejack, honestly! How could it not? 

    Spike Wouldn't it be easier to just fly? 
    Twilight Sparkle I told you, Spike. We're following Applejack's list to the letter, and Applejack doesn't fly!  
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself. 
    Rarity  

    Rarity Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike and I were just trying to follow Applejack's list as closely as possible. 
    Spike Mmmh... Maybe not the best plan. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs. 
     
    Applejack That's alright, Twilight. I know you did your best. I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things. 
    Twilight Sparkle At least you two got to spend some time at the spa together. 
    Spike Yeah, that must've been super relaxing! 
    Rarity Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes. 
    Twilight Sparkle What about your hour of spa perfection? 
    Rarity As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them. 
    Applejack I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation.  It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse! 
     
     
    Applejack I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how!  Why are y'all starin' at me like that? 
     
    Rarity Um... Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs? 
    Applejack What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe. 
    Twilight Sparkle But it doesn't squeak anymore. 
    Applejack Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen. 
    Spike They don't look scared to me. 
    Applejack Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake. 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, Applejack? It seems like everything you're doing is to fix things that aren't really problems anymore. 
    Applejack Well, I'll be... 
    Rarity Hmmm... Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all. 
    Applejack Huh. I wonder if I've been doin' that around here with anythin' else. 
    Rarity Well, there's only one way to find out! 

     
     

     

     
     

    Applejack  Thanks, y'all. I guess I just got so used to doin' everythin' a certain way, I didn't realize there were any problems. 
    Twilight Sparkle Having a friend look at what you're doing with an outside eye can really help! 
    Rarity Mm-hmm! And I suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would've realized it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, now that your chores are streamlined, what are you gonna do with all the extra time? 
    Applejack I think I have a few ideas. 

     
    Applejack  Think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax? 
    Rarity Oh, please. I could plan a week's worth of treatments! 
    Applejack Heh. Well, let's just start with the rest of the day for now. After all the work we just did on the farm, I am ready for some serious relaxation! 
    Rainbow Dash  Thanks for letting me know there was an opening. I don't know if I could make it without my pampered muscle massage. 
    Aloe Don't vorry about it. Shall I put you down for another one tomorrow? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, absolutely! Sometimes a girl just has to pamper herself, am I right? 
    Rarity You certainly are! 
    Rainbow Dash  Oh! Hey! I was just, uh, uh... 
    Applejack Gettin' a "sports" pamperin'?  
    Rarity  Don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We were just heading in for some pampering ourselves. You could always join us. 
    Applejack That is, if you don't mind sufferin' through one or two "froufrou" treatments. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... I suppose I could take it. You know, for you ponies. 
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity  

     

Flutter Brutter

    Mrs. Shy We're so happy you could come have lunch with your father and me, Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy I'm so glad you asked. 
    Rainbow Dash And it was super awesome of you to invite me too! Things have been so busy with the Wonderbolts lately, it's great to get a chance to relax someplace quiet. 
    Mr. Shy That's exactly what I intend to do now that I've retired. In fact, I converted the back house to showcase my cloud collection. I have my clouds, your mom has her flowers, you've got your animals, and your brother... 
    Mrs. Shy Zephyr Breeze has his... interests.  
    Rainbow Dash I'll say! Remember when he was convinced square clouds were gonna be the next big thing?  
    Mrs. Shy He's matured a lot since then. 
    Mr. Shy Actually, it's funny you bring Zephyr up... 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! Not again! 
    Mrs. Shy It's just for a little while, dear. 'Til he gets back on his hooves. 
    Rainbow Dash Wait, you don't meanâ€”! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Guess who's home! That's right, big sis, it's your one and only favorite little brother, moi. 
    Fluttershy  

     

     
    Zephyr Breeze Hi, Flutterbutter! How's the bestest big sister ever? Hey, where's the love? How about a little excitement to see your baby brother? 
    Fluttershy I'm just surprised. When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling. 
    Zephyr Breeze Oh, it is, sis, it is. You would not believe how much stress ponies hold in their manes. Everything gets limp and unmanageable. No offense, but brushing alone won't solve the problem. 
    Fluttershy What went wrong? 
    Zephyr Breeze Nothing went wrong, per se. It's just the powers that be were so locked into their required styles, and you know me. I've got my own style! And I think they were a little threatened. 
    Mrs. Shy O-Oh, this is... lovely, dear. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 
    Zephyr Breeze Welllll, if it ain't Rainbows "The Best Flyer There Ever Was" Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash  Oh, this ought to be good. 
    Zephyr Breeze Sorry, I shouldn't tease you. I know the whole super awesome flyer bit's just to impress me. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Zephyr Breeze Still, thanks for showing up for my homecoming. It's, it's sweet. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Zephyr Breeze I kinda thought there'd be more ponies here. I mean, what about your party planner friend, um... Sprinkle Pie! She could've turned this into a real house partay, am I right? I mean, this place could use it.  Drab! 
    Mrs. Shy Heh. I-I, eh... 
    Mr. Shy We have been meaning to redecorate... 
    Zephyr Breeze Dad, please. When I get all my stuff back in here, you won't even remember what this boring old place looked like! 
     
    Fluttershy  Um, Mom, Dad, can I talk to you for a second? 

    Mrs. Shy  What is it, honey? 
    Fluttershy I'm not so sure letting Zephyr move back home is a good idea. I know you both want to help, but don't you remember last time? 
    Mrs. Shy Zephyr's just trying to find his place, dear. 
    Fluttershy  I know. It just seems like his place always ends up being your place. And then he sort of makes you do everything for him! 
    Mr. Shy Well, we may not be as bold as you, Fluttershy, but don't you worry. We know how to stand up for ourselves. 

    Zephyr Breeze And they were all like, "We love your free spirit, Zeph! And it would be wrong to cage that! Go follow your dreams!" 
     
    Rainbow Dash Zeph was just telling me all about the ins and outs of mane therapy school. 
    Zephyr Breeze It's all so political. I just could not take it! 
    Fluttershy Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks... 
    Zephyr Breeze Sorry, sis, but when something's not the right fit, this pony's gotta fly! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze  Anyway, good talk, Rainbows. I am so touched you came to see me, really. I hate to deprive you of my presence, but this breeze needs his Z's. 
    Rainbow Dash You know it's the middle of the day, right? 
    Zephyr Breeze I know.  Thanks. 
    Rainbow Dash  Same old Zeph. 

    Rainbow Dash I know you weren't expecting to see your brother, but you've been kind of quiet, even for you. 
    Fluttershy I'm sorry, but I am just so... so... peeved right now!  Excuse my language! 
    Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend! 
    Applejack  
     
    Fluttershy Oh, um, sorry about that. 
    Rainbow Dash We just had lunch with Fluttershy's parents, and you'll never guess who showed up. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle Donkey? Cheese Sandwich? Ms. Harshwhinny?! 
    Rainbow Dash Zephyr Breeze. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, that makes more sense. 
    Applejack And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his "extended stays"? 
    Rainbow Dash She's a bit peeved. 
    Fluttershy Zephyr's my brother, and I love him. But he's never learned to do anything for himself. I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them! 
    Applejack Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them. 
    Fluttershy You know, you're right! 

    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy Zephyr Breeze! 
    Zephyr Breeze Oh, hey, sis. Come to see me work my magic and turn this place from drab to fab, huh? Well, watch and learn! 
    Fluttershy Can't you see what you're doing?! 
    Zephyr Breeze Yeah! I'm getting rid of this old stuff so I can turn the backhouse into my art studio! I've decided I'm gonna be a sculptor! 
    Fluttershy I'm talking about Mom's flowers! 
    Zephyr Breeze She's gonna move them so I can have my meditation patio here. She loves replanting stuff. Don't you, Mom? 
    Fluttershy And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born. 
    Mr. Shy The very best from every production run since my first day on the job. Ah! 
     
    Mr. Shy  But why hold onto the past really? 
    Fluttershy You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here. 
    Zephyr Breeze But this is the only place big enough for my studio/meditation garden. Ooh! Unless I do it in the living room! 
    Fluttershy  I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you. 
    Zephyr Breeze Don't be so dramatic, sis! Mom and Dad just wanna let me be me! Right? I can do plenty on my own. 
    Fluttershy I agree. Which is why you should move out. 
    Zephyr Breeze Oh. Well... I mean, I-I totally would, but... I don't think that's what Mom and Dad want! It's not, is it? 
    Mrs. Shy Ehhh... 
    Mr. Shy You know we love you, son, but your sister has a point. 
    Zephyr Breeze  Sure. I mean, I really just came back here to keep you guys company, but... whatever's best for the family. I just... I just gotta grab a few essentials. 
    Mrs. Shy And... y-you definitely have somewhere else to go? 
    Zephyr Breeze Of course! There's plenty of ponies who'd love for a little breeze to blow their way... 

    Rainbow Dash So... where's Zeph gonna go now? 
    Fluttershy I'm not sure. Oh, I hope I did the right thing... 
    Rainbow Dash Are you kidding? One hundred percent! 
    Zephyr Breeze  Hey, sis! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Your new roomie's here! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, maybe like seventy percent. 

    Fluttershy Um, Zephyr. When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here. 
    Zephyr Breeze Well, it's not their house, so by definition, it's someplace else. Am I right, Rainbows? Stop oogling me and help settle this. 
    Rainbow Dash  You know what? I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie... sprinkle... something. 
     
    Fluttershy You said you had plenty of places to go! 
    Zephyr Breeze Ehhhh... 
    Fluttershy  Fine. You can stay hereâ€” 
    Zephyr Breeze You're the best! We're gonna have so much fun. 
    Fluttershy On one condition. 
    Zephyr Breeze Totally. Anything. 
    Fluttershy You have to get a job. 
    Zephyr Breeze Cracking the whip, huh? You always were kind of bossy. 
    Fluttershy  Zephyr Breeze... 
    Zephyr Breeze Kidding! Get a job. Absolutely. 
     

     
    Zephyr Breeze  Where are we goin' so early? You have no idea how bad morning sun is for your mane. 
    Fluttershy Remember how we talked about you getting a job? 
    Zephyr Breeze It was just yesterday, and it's totally on my to-do list, but you can't expect to find something befitting my awesomeness overnight. 
    Fluttershy I thought you might say that. 
     
     
    Fluttershy So I did it for you. 
    Zephyr Breeze What?! 

    Rarity These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors. Do you think you can handle that? 
    Zephyr Breeze  Um, I don't know... 
    Rarity You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies. Ta-ta! 
    Fluttershy Good luck! 
     
     

    Fluttershy Thanks for giving my brother a job. I just hope he's up to the task. 
    Rarity Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing! 
     
    Rarity You just dip cloth in a boâ€” 
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Zephyr Breeze  Rarity, you're back! 
    Fluttershy What did you do? 
    Zephyr Breeze Since you talk to animals all the time, I just figured it runs in the family, so why not outsource this stuff, you know? 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Turns out the animal communication thing isn't genetic. 
    Rarity Zephyr, I asked you to do this job! Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures! 
    Zephyr Breeze Okay, I guess you have some feelings about this. But you should know it's basically your cat's fault for walking by and giving me the idea. But I'm actually kinda into this look! 
    Opalescence  
    Zephyr Breeze So I guess what I'm saying is... you're welcome? 
    Rarity  Zephyr, this is just unacceptable! 
    Zephyr Breeze Wow. I guess I know when my efforts aren't appreciated. 
    Rarity Ugghh! 
     
    Fluttershy  

    Zephyr Breeze Whoa! Those are tall! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm glad you noticed, because they're your new job. 
    Zephyr Breeze Wha?  You said you were taking me to tea with the princess! 
    Fluttershy Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work. 
    Zephyr Breeze Sis, c'mon! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Zephyr, it'll be easy. I just need a Pegasus pony to fly up and wipe each window down from top to bottom. 
    Spike And I'm here to make sure you do it right. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, Zephyr! This looks amazing! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Uh, you know, like you said, it was easy! 
    Fluttershy Where's Spike? 
    Spike Up here! 
    Twilight Sparkle You were supposed to supervise, not do all the work! 
    Spike I was supervising! And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I couldâ€” Hey! I did all the work! 
    Zephyr Breeze Don't let him fool you. Old Spike is quite the taskmaster. 
     

    Zephyr Breeze Oh, come on, sis. I had to ask Spike to make sure I was doing it right. 
    Fluttershy You didn't do it at all!  Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job. 
    Zephyr Breeze Next job? 
     
    Rainbow Dash That's right, Zeph! You're coming with me! 
    Zephyr Breeze You don't have to come up with some excuse to hang out with me, Rainbows! Let's just go for a fly and see where the day takes us. 
    Rainbow Dash  And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud! Got it?! 
    Zephyr Breeze Oh, I got it. I can already feel the electricity between us. 

     
    Zephyr Breeze Rainbow Dash is crazy, okay?! She expects me to do stuff right when she asks me to do it! It's insane! 
    Fluttershy So you just quit? Again? 
    Zephyr Breeze Escaped is more like it. Besides, what was I supposed to do? 
    Fluttershy Keep trying? Finish something for once? Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do! 
    Zephyr Breeze That all sounds fine for your friends, but it's just not me. 
    Fluttershy Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here. 
    Zephyr Breeze Fine! I'll just go live in the woods like my foreponies before me! Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on is his own! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing. You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks! 
    Fluttershy I guess so... 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy Oh, hello, Constance! 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy Oh? Oh, dear. 

    Zephyr Breeze See, Wigford? The Breeze needs nopony! We've got food, shelter. Just need to put the old kettle on... 
     
     
    Zephyr Breeze Come on, sticky-sticky, make with the sparks! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Ugh! What's a pony got to do to find a decent stick around here?! 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Ugh.  
    Rainbow Dash I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but... 
    Fluttershy Oh... I can't let him live like this. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night. 
     
     
    Zephyr Breeze  Such an exhausting day, y'know? 
    Rainbow Dash It's noon. 
    Zephyr Breeze You know me!  Siesta... 
     
    Zephyr Breeze Ugh... I can't do this. I can't do anything. 
    Fluttershy Zephyr, you're smart and talented. You could do anything if you just tried! 
    Zephyr Breeze And what if I give everything I have and still fail? Honestly, I think it's better not to try at all. 
    Rainbow Dash But then you won't ever do anything. 
    Zephyr Breeze I don't expect you two to understand. I mean, when have you ever failed? You've literally helped save Equestria, like, a dozen times. 
    Fluttershy And I was worried that I'd fail every time! Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail. 
    Zephyr Breeze But failing is the worst! 
    Fluttershy And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it? 
    Zephyr Breeze No. 
    Fluttershy So here's the deal You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say. No exceptions. 
    Zephyr Breeze  I will literally do anything you ask me if it means I don't have to stay here. 

    Fluttershy Okay, you know what you have to do, right? 
    Zephyr Breeze Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated. Just kidding! Total opposite of that. Got it. 
     
    Rainbow Dash You think he can do it? 

    

        Everypony has times in their lives 
        When their hearts are filled with doubt 

    

        Frustration builds up inside 
        And it makes you want to shout 

    

        But if you just take that first step 
        The next one will appear 

    

        And you find you can walk, then run 
        Then fly...! 
        Into the stratosphere 

        You've got to give it your best 
        So you can pass the test 
        Give it everything that you've got 

        And we know you can win 
        You just have to begin 
        Have to give it your very best shot 

    

        There are times when you want to give up 
        When you think that you can't go on 

    

        But if you fight through with all of your might 
        You will find that you can't go wrong 
        That you could do it all along 

    

        Everypony has times in their lives 
        When their hearts are filled with doubt 

    

        But if you just give it your all 
        You'll start to work it out 

    

        And I know I can't give up too soon 
        Get myself in the zone 
        And I find I can walk, then run 

    

        Then fly...! 

    

        I can do it on my own 

    

        You can do it on your own 

    

        I can do it on my own 
        I can do it on my own 

    Zephyr Breeze I did it! I actually finished something! By myself! 
    Rainbow Dash And it looks exactly like it's supposed to. 
    Fluttershy I knew you could do it, Zephyr. 
    Zephyr Breeze I didn't! But I do now. Thanks for believing in me, sis. 
    Fluttershy That's what big sisters are for. 
    Rainbow Dash So, Zeph, now that you've accomplished this, what's next? 
    Zephyr Breeze Anything I want! I mean, the sky's the limit, right? 
     
    Zephyr Breeze But, y'know... I've got some baby steps in mind. 

    Rainbow Dash Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Shy! Ha! It was great as usual. 
    Mrs. Shy Thank you, dear, for not giving up on Zephyr. After all these years of pining for him, it must be so satisfying to see him on the right track. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh...? 
    Fluttershy Have you heard from Zephyr? Is he doing well? 
    Mr. Shy I tell you, he's a brand new pony! So full of drive and determination. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. That's great. 
     
    Zephyr Breeze  Guess who graduated from mane therapy training? 
    Rainbow Dash Hah, awesome! 
    Mr. Shy Congratulations, son! 
    Mrs. Shy You look so handsome! 
    Fluttershy I'm so proud of you, Zephyr. 
    Zephyr Breeze It was only a matter of time before they recognized my true genius! But actually doing the work probably helped, and I wouldn't have if it weren't for you. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I just gave you some encouragement. You did this on your own. 
    Zephyr Breeze And honestly, right now I feel like I can do anything... except find a place. I can still crash here for a few days, right? 

     

Spice Up Your Life

    Twilight Sparkle As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship. 
    Spike Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Ooh, well done! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now without further ado... 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa! No, me and Rainbow Dash in Las Pegasus! No, Rainbow Dash and Twilight in Yakyakistan! No, Twilight and Twilight in Twilight's castle! Oh. Me! Me! Oh, me... and Rarity! Ooh! I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before! 
    Rarity  I'll have to pack extra outfits! What will I wear?! 
    Pinkie Pie Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things. 

     

    Rarity  Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the properâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem. It finds you. We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam! We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes. 
    Rarity Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go. But where's the flow saying we should go? 
    Pinkie Pie You know Canterlot. What do you think we should do? 
    Rarity Hm. Take your pick. Culture, couture, cuisine! 
     
    Rarity Oh, my. Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch? I know just where to go. 

    Rarity Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, so many choices! Where should we go? This one? That one? Those ones? 
    Rarity Any establishments that have this â€“ the three-hoof rating. 
    Pinkie Pie Um, whose hooves? 
    Rarity Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine. When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria. She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation. Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive. 
    Pinkie Pie What's so important about her approval? 
    Rarity Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine. 
    Pinkie Pie Wow! Then the food here must be amazing! Lead the way, partner! Whee!  

    Rarity  Ah. Yes. Very nice... 
     
    Pinkie Pie Nom nom nom.  whatever this is. Can we try someplace else? 

    Pinkie Pie Nom nom. Ugh. Maybe one more stop? 

    Pinkie Pie Blech! Nope. 

    Pinkie Pie Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place? 
    Rarity Ugh! Very well. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity The Tasty Treat. It's very... rustic.  It looks like it hasn't even been rated. 
    Pinkie Pie Thank goodness! Hee-hee! 
     

     
    Rarity Are we sure they're open? 
    Pinkie Pie  Mmmm. It smells open. 
     
    Saffron Masala Oh! Are you here for lunch? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, indeedy! 
    Saffron Masala I'm Saffron Masala, the chef here at The Tasty Treat, the most exotic cuisine in Canterlot. Would you like to hear about the specials? 
    Rarity We're actually in a bit of a hurâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, please! 
    Saffron Masala We have a curried oat cake. 
    Pinkie Pie We'll take one! 
    Saffron Masala Uh, and a grass sandwich that has been marinated overnight in a mustard Dijon dressing. 
    Pinkie Pie How can you say no to that? 
    Saffron Masala A-And for you? 
    Rarity Oh, me? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.  No rating. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Coriander Cumin  
    Pinkie Pie Hiya! What's your name? 
    Coriander Cumin Coriander Cumin. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you a chef here too? 
    Coriander Cumin My daughter cooks. I host. 
    Pinkie Pie Then why are you stacking chairs? 
    Coriander Cumin Without customers, I have nopony to host for. So I stack! 
    Saffron Masala Father, stop it! Don't close up the restaurant around our guests. 
    Coriander Cumin What does it matter?! When they leave, nopony else will be coming in! 
    Saffron Masala Well, your attitude isn't going to bring anyone in! Can't you at least pretend to be positive?! 
    Pinkie Pie  So good! 
    Coriander Cumin You are doing enough pretending for the both of us. Nopony here wants to try anything new! I know when to throw in the towel! 
    Rarity Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves. 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, Rarity, try this! 
    Rarity  Ooh! 
    Saffron Masala Maybe if you would listen to my ideas for once... 
    Coriander Cumin Oh, yes! I did not move halfway across Equestria for my daughter that I never listen to! 
    Pinkie Pie  Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes! 
    Rarity These two? Oh, I don't know, darling. The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them. 
    Coriander Cumin  What would you have me do? We can't even get Zesty Gourmand to come to our restaurant. She took one look at how empty it was and said it wasn't even worth rating! 
    Rarity That's it! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! Uh, what's it? 
    Rarity The flow has led us here! This is our mission!  We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here! 
    Pinkie Pie  And I can pack this place with ponies! 
    Coriander Cumin Hmph. And how do you intend to do such a thing? 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity Just leave it to us! 

    Saffron Masala Father, will you please stop packing things?! 
    Coriander Cumin When the lovely pony comes back and says she couldn't convince Zesty Gourmand to come visit us, we will need to pack all this up. I am just getting a head start. 
    Pinkie Pie You really don't know Rarity. 
    Rarity  I've done it! 
    Pinkie Pie See? 
    Rarity It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food! 
    Coriander Cumin What is the catch? 
    Rarity Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight. 
    Coriander Cumin Pfft. Oh, yeah, right. 
    Saffron Masala What is it? 
    Rarity Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done. 
    Pinkie Pie Like what? 
    Rarity Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu.  We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan. 
    Coriander Cumin Pfft. 
    Saffron Masala Father, after Rarity went to all of this trouble for us, can't we at least try? 
    Rarity Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business. 
    Pinkie Pie One packed restaurant, coming right up! 
    Rarity Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row! 

     
    Saffron Masala  I hope my father doesn't drive Rarity crazy. 
    Pinkie Pie It'll be fine. Rarity's gonna make sure that The Tasty Treat is the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not like all of those stuffy places on Restaurant Row.

        It's gonna work 
        I swear it's gonna work 
        It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see! 

    Saffron Masala  The day is almost over, and we haven't found any ponies! What will we do? 
    Pinkie Pie Try harder! Fillies and gentlecolts! Check out the super stupendous and amazing cuisine of The Tasty Treat! Grand re-opening tonight! 
    "Citrus Blush" How many hooves does it have? 
    Saffron Masala No hooves yet, but hopefully soon! 
    "Cayenne" Well, when it gets rated, let us know. 
    Pinkie Pie Rrrgh! Stupid hooves! 
     
     
    Chargrill Breadwinner Oh, look at this, hun! 
    Orange Slice Oh, The Tasty Treat! Do you think that's a restaurant, sugar? 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! Yes, it is! 
    Chargrill Breadwinner We came to Canterlot from Whinnyapolis to be adventurous. But so far, the food in all these hoity-toity places tastes like somepony cooked up nothin' with a side o' nothin'. 
    Saffron Masala Well, please, come try the Tasty Treat. I think it's going to be exactly what you're looking for. 

     
    Rarity  This is going to be exactly what Zesty is looking for! 
     
    Saffron Masala Father, we're baâ€”  
    Pinkie Pie Rarity, what did you do? 
    Coriander Cumin  Welcome to The Tasty Treat. You can eat here if you want. Or not. Who cares? 
    Rarity I know. Isn't it perfect? Zesty is sure to love it. 
    Pinkie Pie I thought we were trying to make this the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not make it exactly like every other restaurant! 
    Rarity  We want to help our friends by getting them three hooves. That will only happen if this is like every other restaurant. 
    Saffron Masala Father, what is this?! 
    Pinkie Pie Not that! Anything but that! 
    Coriander Cumin This is what we must cook if we want to succeed here! 
    Saffron Masala This isn't what I wanted! I wanted Canterlot to like us for us! 
    Pinkie Pie Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?! 
    Rarity Oh, pff. Kch. Ts! We helped save the restaurant. Now, where are the other guests? How many other ponies are coming? 
    Pinkie Pie and Saffron Masala Two. 
    Rarity Just two?! I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what! 
    Pinkie Pie You said you would make the restaurant better... 
    Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie ...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about! 
     
    Rarity  Zesty Gourmand! Everypony, places! 
     
    Rarity  

    Coriander Cumin  Welcome to The Tasty Treat. What can I get you this evening? 
    Zesty Gourmand I hardly think it matters, but by all means, try your best to impress. 
    Orange Slice Well, we'll both try the special this evening. Maybe with a little kick to it, eh? Yeah, we've been craving some food with actual taste. 
    Coriander Cumin Saffron Masala, what are you doing?! 
    Saffron Masala I'm trying to save our reputations!  I've given it at least a little bit of flavor. 
    Rarity No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants! 
    Pinkie Pie What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?! That's insane! 
     
    Pinkie Pie I'm taking this out there! 
    Rarity No! Zesty will hate it! You are going to ruin this for them! 
    Pinkie Pie No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it! 
     
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity Noooooo! 
     
    Zesty Gourmand I think we are done here. 
    Rarity Zesty! Please wait! Allow me to explain! 
    Zesty Gourmand Rarity, when it comes to fashion, you are adequate. But take some advice from a friend â€“ keep your opinions out of restaurants. Substandard food, laughable service, and I would think even you could recognize that the decor here is trying desperately while desperately failing. Recommending a disreputable place such as this could do serious damage to your social standing. 
    Pinkie Pie Disreputable?! You mean a place with food that actually tastes good? 
    Zesty Gourmand Anypony can throw ingredients together and create an obvious taste that uncultured ponies like those two can register. 
    Chargrill Breadwinner Hey! 
    Zesty Gourmand But it takes a true culinary artist to create a subtle taste, the barest hint of a sensation. That's what I bring to Canterlot. That's art. 
     

    Pinkie Pie I'm so embarrassed. 
    Rarity I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are. 
    Coriander Cumin The worst has happened. No use crying over spilt food now. 
    Saffron Masala Here. This always cheered me up when I was younger. 
    Coriander Cumin  My spicy flat-noodle soup! 
    Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Coriander Cumin  
    Rarity Oh, my! This is truly delightful! 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far! And I thought the food before was the best! 
    Saffron Masala That's all I've ever wanted to do, father! Make food for the ponies of Canterlot like the food we made together when I was younger! 
    Coriander Cumin It has been so long since we cooked together. Heh. Remember how you used to hide the ingredients you did not like? 
    Coriander Cumin and Saffron Masala  
    Rarity You know what? Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here? It's exquisite. 
    Pinkie Pie That's true. 
    Rarity And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it. 
    Pinkie Pie That's double true! 
    Rarity You just need ponies in here to give it a chance! Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city! 
    Pinkie Pie That's true times three! 
    Saffron Masala But without Zesty's approval, nopony will even try our food! 
    Rarity Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! I will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in! 
    Coriander Cumin And? What about us? 
    Rarity You two? You are going to cook! Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it! I intend to bring a crowd! 

     
    Rarity Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous? 

    Rarity It's almost time! Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening? 
    Saffron Masala Before we open, my father and I just wanted to say... Thank you for all of your help. We've both been so stressed about the restaurant succeeding that we forgot what it was we loved about it in the first place. 
    Coriander Cumin Cooking is something we used to love to do together. No matter what happens next, thank you for reminding us of that. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, you guys! Group hug! 
    Pinkie Pie and Coriander Cumin  
    Pinkie Pie Now come on! We've got a party to throw! 
     
     
    Coriander Cumin Welcome to The Tasty Treat! Make yourselves comfortable! 
     
    Saffron Masala Please, feel free to sample the food! 
     
    Zesty Gourmand What's this?! What is everypony doing here?! This place has no hooves! It is not in keeping with the level of cuisine that I have set for Canterlot! Nopony told you this place was acceptable! 
    "Sweet Biscuit" Uh, Rarity and her friend said it was good? They told us! 
    Zesty Gourmand They told you? And who are they to tell you anything? Rarity can tell you what hats to wear with which skirts. Her friend can tell you how to maintain a tragic look for a frizzy mane. They can't tell you what food you can eat! 
    Rarity No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific... 
    Pinkie Pie And very strange! 
    Rarity Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same! 
    Burly Unicorn Rarity is right! I for one think the food here is delicious! I own The Smoked Oat on Restaurant Row; I hate the food we make! From now on, it's all smoked, basted, and grilled! 
    Matronly Pony This food is an inspiration! I own The Bake Stop. I'm going to bake my mother's bundt cake the way she made it â€“ full of flavor! 
     
    Rarity Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food? Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing. 
    Zesty Gourmand Hmph! 
     
     
     
    Saffron Masala Thank you so much! 
    Coriander Cumin You are both truly amazing. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Nothing can stop the dynamic duo of Pinkie and Rarity! 
     

     

Stranger Than Fan Fiction

     
    Daring Do  
     
     
    Daring Do Whoa!  Oof! 
     
     

    Rainbow Dash Well, don't stop there! You read, I pack! That's the deal! 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I just keep thinking about how much fun you're gonna have at the Daring Do convention. I wish Princess Celestia didn't need my help with the friendship summit in Griffonstone. 
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry. I'll make sure A. K. Yearling signs your book. I can't believe she's gonna be there! She never goes to conventions! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash Which, I guess, will be cool for all those other fanponies. But since you and I know A. K. Yearling personally,  it's no big deal. This convention will be fun, but it's nothing to get too excited about. 

    Rainbow Dash So excited! 
     

     

     
    Salespony You look like a pony who'd be up for an all-inclusive one-of-a-kind adventu-cation, where you can get to live the Daring Do experience! 
    Rainbow Dash No thanks. Did that already. Ahhh. 
     
    Rainbow Dash This is the... 
    Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants ...awesomest thing ever! 
    Quibble Pants Now this is something that only a true fan can appreciate. 
    Rainbow Dash They even put the tiles in the right order. 
    Quibble Pants Huh. Good catch. Oh, I'm Quibble Pants. Nice to meet you. 
    Rainbow Dash Rainbow Dash. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Nice costume. 
    Quibble Pants You, too. 
    Rainbow Dash Thanks. The hard part was figuring out the right... 
    Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants ...number of arrow holes. 
    Quibble Pants B-B-Because on page 84 of Sapphire Stone, i-it describes her dodging a, quote, "score of arrows shooting forth from holes in the very walls," unquote, but then on page 107, Daring Do says she, quote, "barely made it past the traps' barrage of arrows," unquote, but clearly, Daring Do is embellishing and the correct number of arrows is... 
    Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants Twenty!  

     

    Rainbow Dash  I am so glad I ran into you. Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do. 
    Quibble Pants I know what you mean. It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it. 
    Rainbow Dash Hm. That's weird. We've only done stuff from the first trilogy. After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books. 
    Quibble Pants Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are no other books. 
    Rainbow Dash Of course there are. Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces ofâ€” 
    Quibble Pants Uh, p-please, please don't. Just don't even mention the titles. I-I'm not saying those books don't exist. I'm saying that I refuse to acknowledge them. 
    Rainbow Dash Why? 
    Quibble Pants 'Cause they're horrible! I mean, there isn't a single thing after Ring of Destiny that is even remotely in the realm of the possible! 
    Rainbow Dash What?! I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible! 
    Quibble Pants Uh, and how could you possibly know that? 
    Rainbow Dash Gyuh, uh, I just... do! 
    Quibble Pants Well, that's a compelling argument. 
    Rainbow Dash Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much? 
    Quibble Pants I don't hate Daring Do. The first series was smart and cool and an amazing nod to old-time serialized adventure books, that somehow manages to be self-reflective and ironic while at the same time celebrating the art form without a hint of cynicism. Which is why I came here to ask A. K. Yearling muzzle-to-muzzle why she sold out and dumbed down the rest of her books into just a series of impossible action sequences! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, now I know you're crazy. A. K. Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last! 
    Quibble Pants Wha... Wow. Okay, yeah, I-I-I'm sorry, but I could never be friends with somepony who's willing to believe impossible stuff is possible as long as Daring Do does it. 
    Rainbow Dash That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time! 
    Quibble Pants Fine! 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! 

    Rainbow Dash Look, just tell A. K. Yearling that Rainbow Dash is here, and I need her help to convince a know-it-all pony that everything Daring Do's ever done actually happened! 
     
    A. K. Yearling Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash A. K.! I gotta talk to you. It's an emergency! 
    A. K. Yearling  Not here! 

     
    A. K. Yearling  Now tell me, what's going on? Is it Caballeron? Did you see him? 
    Rainbow Dash What? No. But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything you've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic and terrible. And I need you to help me prove to him that it's all totally possible. 
    A. K. Yearling I've got bigger problems on my hooves than dissatisfied fanponies. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
    A. K. Yearling The Amulet of Culiacan, and Caballeron wants it. But the amulet's only a key.  The real treasure is hidden in a lost temple. The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc. Caballeron wants to sell it to the highest bidder, of course, which is why I need to find it first. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! Sounds like another awesome Daring Do adventure! But... what are you doing here? 
    A. K. Yearling Since I haven't found the temple yet, it's the safest place for me and the amulet. It's crawling with security, and if I get into trouble... 
     
    Daring Do ...I can just blend in with all the Daring Do cosplayers. 
    Rainbow Dash How can I help? 
    Daring Do Just keep your eyes out for anything suspicious. 
    Rainbow Dash Got it! 
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Does a pony who only likes your first trilogy qualify as suspicious? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Heh, just checking. 
     

     
    Dr. Caballeron  I mean, where is the booth for Caballeron? 
     
    Dr. Caballeron I do not see the likeness. Come, let us find Daring Do and the Amulet of Culiacan. I don't want to spend any more time in this place than I have to! 

     
    Quibble Pants Well, if it isn't the pony who know impossible things can happen because she just does! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Sorry, Quibble, I've got more important things to do than argue with a pony who thinks awesome means unrealistic. 
     
    Quibble Pants No, wait! I want to hear more about how you're one hundred percent sure that in Curse of the Jungle Queen, Daring Do could survive a sixty-story drop from the top of a waterfall after sustaining a broken wing in a category-six rapid! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Obviously, her wing wasn't brokeâ€” Caballeron! 
    Quibble Pants See, now that's a great character. Solid backstory, good motivations... 
    Rainbow Dash No-no-no-no! Caballeron is right there! 
    Quibble Pants Of course he is. He's also over there, over there... Ooh, ooh, over there, and and over there. Where are you going? 
     
    Quibble Pants And we're out here because...? 
    Rainbow Dash Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way! 
    Quibble Pants Okay. I'm gonna head back inside. There's just a little too much crazy out here for the both of us. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     

    Dr. Caballeron I do not know what Daring Do is playing at, but if she told you two fanponies of my plan to steal the amulet, you must work for her. 
    Rainbow Dash Caballeron! Hah! What do you have to say now, Quibble? 
    Quibble Pants This was your plan to prove the Daring Do books are realistic? You bought a Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, really? 
    Rainbow Dash What?! No! Look around us! Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to? This is the real deal! 
    Quibble Pants Right. We're actually being held captive by Caballeron. Please! This guy's accent is all over the place! No offense. 
    Dr. Caballeron I... 
    Quibble Pants So what's the setup here? You've... kidnapped us, and taken us to the middle of nowhere because...? 
    Dr. Caballeron The Temple of Chicomoztoc is somewhere in this jungle. When I find it, the Seven-Sided Chest is as good as mine! I just need the Amulet of Culiacan to unlock it. 
    Quibble Pants Uh-huh, and Daring Do has the amulet so you came up with this over-complicated plot to lure her into the jungle and exchange it for us. 
    Dr. Caballeron I wouldn't call it over-complicated, but... yes. 
    Quibble Pants Okay, we're done here. Great work. Seriously, very believable. 
     
    Quibble Pants  Listen, pal, you can keep her money, but I'm notâ€” 
    Dr. Caballeron Going anywhere! You may not approve of my plan, but I'm the mastermind here! 
    Quibble Pants  Debatable... 
    Dr. Caballeron And I say you will remain here until Daring Do comes to rescue you. And if she wants you back in one piece, she will give me the amulet! Tie them up! 
     
    Rainbow Dash The Griffon's Lock! 
    Dr. Caballeron You know of it? Further proof that you are an agent of Daring Do! 
    Quibble Pants Or an avid reader. 
     
    Dr. Caballeron And now I will continue my search for the temple. Don't go anywhere.  
    Quibble Pants Listen, if I pretend to believe this nonsense is real, will you call off the henchpony repertory theater over there? 
    Rainbow Dash They're not gonna listen to me. They abducted us both. 
    Quibble Pants Oh, wow, so you're gonna stick with that script? O-Okay, fine. We're, we're in a Daring Do Adventure.  
     
    "Pickpocket" What was that?! 
    Quibble Pants  Daring Do. Thank goodness. We're over here. 
    "Pickpocket" Fan out! We can't let Daring Do rescue these two! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Quibble Pants  All four?! I mean, shouldn't at least one of them stay behind to guard us? Oh, oh, wait, the... No, because then it wouldn't be a terrible Daring Do adventure. 
    Rainbow Dash It doesn't matter. We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Okay, that was pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do! 
    Quibble Pants No way. Just point me to the hotel and you can play fanpony and hunt treasure out here all day long. 
    Rainbow Dash  Fine. Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal? 
    Quibble Pants I...  Fine. 
    Rainbow Dash  Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you. 

    Quibble Pants ...which would make Daring Do left-hoofed, which we know is false, and that is everything that's wrong with Daring Do and the Trek to the Terrifying Tower. Now, the problems with the next book are evenâ€” Oh, right. What Daring Do adventure would be complete without the precarious rope bridge? 
     
    Quibble Pants Look, I'm all for making things feel as real as possible, but are these Adventu-cation ponies sure this thing is safe? 
    Rainbow Dash Is it too "realistic" for you? Wouldn't want that on a Daring Do adventure, would we? 
    Quibble Pants If this were really a real Daring Do adventure, I'm sure I'd step on the wrong plank at exactly the wrongâ€” 
     
    Quibble Pants Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Quibble Pants  Good thing this is all just a pretend adventure. Least we know all of this struggling won't make the bridge fall apart. 
     
    Quibble Pants You need to get your money back. 
     
    Quibble Pants  
     
    Quibble Pants  
    Rainbow Dash Hah! How's that for not possible? 
    Quibble Pants That was... awesome! I-I-I thought we... and then you, and the flying...! Wow, and I was like, "Where are you going?!" A-a-and then you swerved, and I was, I was, I was on the water, and then  Wow! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic. 
    Quibble Pants Okay, I'll give you that one. I mean we could have been done for.  We could have been done for! W-What kind of Adventu-cation is this?! I mean, that's just, that's just bad business! What, what are these ponies thinking?! 
    Dr. Caballeron Right now? We are thinking that we should thank you for escaping. For you have led us directly to the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc!  

    Dr. Caballeron Make sure they are secure this time! We can't have them escaping again. 
    Rainbow Dash  You'll never get away with this! 
    Dr. Caballeron Won't I? You've led me to the temple, and Daring Do is too noble to let harm befall her companions, so the amulet is as good as mine. What? No witty remarks this time about how silly my plan is? 
    Quibble Pants This isn't the official Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, is it. 
    Rainbow Dash Finally! 
    Quibble Pants It's some cheap knockoff run by a bunch of incompetent ponies that have no idea how to execute this adventure with any level of safety! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! 
    Quibble Pants What was that with the bridge?! We were in serious danger! I-I'm reporting you all to... well, I don't know who I'm reporting you to, but it's gonna be somepony important! Oh, and this cut-rate excuse for an "Experience" hasn't proved anything except that I'm right! It has all the hallmarks of a lame Daring Do adventure! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh... Quibble? 
    Quibble Pants No, I'm talking! Generic jungle location â€“ check. Overly complicated villain plot â€“ check. Random coincidences that conveniently get us to the next big set piece â€“ check! 
     
    Dr. Caballeron Watch where you are stepping, you fool! 
    Quibble Pants Listen, buddy, I don't take orders from some second-rate performer who learned acting from the Supervillain School of Bad Accents! The only thing this mess is missing is some giant Ahuizotl wannabe monster, and I have a feeling that would be a bit too much for you bargain-basement adventurers to pull off! 
     
    Quibble Pants Huh? 
    Cipactli  
    Quibble Pants Um... you're real. This is real. This is real! 
     
    Cipactli  
     
     
    Daring Do I told you to warn me of anything suspicious, not run off on an adventure without me! 
    Quibble Pants Wha... Whoa, whoa, y-you're real! You-you-you're friends with her? 
    Daring Do Uh, we'll have to do introductions later. Right now we have toâ€” 
    Quibble Pants G-Get out of here, yes! Thank you! 
    Daring Do Actually, no. 
    Quibble Pants What?! 
    Daring Do We can't leave without the treasure. And we should probably get to it before our friend gets any higher. 
    Cipactli  
     

     
    Rainbow Dash Whoa! 
    Daring Do Seven doors, seven locks. One of them leads to the treasure. I'd rather not think about what the others lead to. 
    Quibble Pants Yeah, yeah, the classic "Pony and the Tiger" bit. All you have to do isâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out? 
    Quibble Pants Oh, 'scuse me. 
    Daring Do  
    Quibble Pants  Not that one. 
     
    Quibble Pants Ehhhhh... 
    Daring Do Is he always like this? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah. But... he's usually right. 
    Daring Do  Which lock do you think it is? 
    Quibble Pants Ugh, finally. Look, each door has another door that matches. These two both have Earth ponies fighting serpents. These two have Pegasi fighting griffons. These two have unicorns fighting bears. But this one... 
    Daring Do ...has an Alicorn on it! It's the only one without a match! How did I miss that? 
    Quibble Pants I've been asking myself that ever since book four! 
     
    Quibble Pants The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc! 
     
    Quibble Pants Uh, guys...? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh... The way out is totally covered! How are we gonna get out of here?! 
    Daring Do There! 
    Quibble Pants Seriously, do you ever not escape out of the top of a temple?! 
    Daring Do We'll have to carry Mr. Adventure Critic out with us! 
    Rainbow Dash We won't be fast enough! We'll never make it! 
    Quibble Pants Guys! I think Rainbow Dash and I have this covered. 

     
     
    Quibble Pants Go around! You can't go over him! 
    Daring Do Go over him?! Are you crazy?! 
    Rainbow Dash If Quibble says go over him, we go over him! 
    Cipactli  
    Quibble Pants  
     
     
    Quibble Pants You two are insane! 
    Rainbow Dash You said go over him! 
    Quibble Pants I said go around him! 
    Daring Do  And I said be quiet! 
    Dr. Caballeron This way! I heard them! 
    Quibble Pants  Okay, I got it. Let's create a fake treasure out of mud and rocks, give that to Caballeron, and then weâ€” 
    Daring Do  Not every Daring Do plan has to be super-complicated. 
     
    Dr. Caballeron Rrrgh! I swear I heard them! 
     
    Cipactli  
    Dr. Caballeron and henchponies  
    Dr. Caballeron I'll get you, Daring Dooooo! 
     
    Quibble Pants Meh. Not particularly original or inspired, but it worked. 
    Daring Do Who were you again? 
    Rainbow Dash He's a fan. 
    Daring Do  There's some stairs on the other side of the temple that lead out of the ravine. I suggest you two take them and head west. 
    Rainbow Dash What about you? 
    Daring Do I've gotta get this to a museum. Thanks for your help. I couldn't have done it without you. Both of you. 
     
    Rainbow Dash So...? 
    Quibble Pants So... maybe the later books are slightly more realistic than I gave them credit for. Still don't like them. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! How can youâ€”?! 
    Quibble Pants Wait, hold on. Before we get in another fight, I-I think I finally figured it out! I love the Daring Do that solves puzzles and uses her brain to get out of tough situations, and she did way more of that in the original trilogy! You love the Daring Do that is brave and awesome and comes out on top no matter what the odds! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay...? 
    Quibble Pants And that's okay! We might never agree on what makes Daring Do cool, but you... are definitely cool. I-I mean, the way you saved me on the bridge? Wow! And escaping from the temple... you, Rainbow Dash, are awesome. 
    Rainbow Dash Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh. 
    Quibble Pants I guess we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Friends? 
    Rainbow Dash Definitely friends. 
    Quibble Pants Uh, do you think A. K. Yearling would consider letting me write the next book? I... I think I can make things way clearer. I mean, for instance, in the second adventure... 
     
    Quibble Pants ...there's a side character. I don't want to kind of name it right now, because it's sort of this thing that I've already written a lot of fan fiction on. I don't want you to... Not that I'm saying that you would steal it! But I am saying this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle-solving, except what if each puzzle that was solved, uh, unlocked a new karate move? Think of it that way, right? And I mean I'm kind of a "Yearlite" myself, so I'm sure she'd be open toâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... Quibble? 
    Quibble Pants Sorry! 

The Cart Before the Ponies

     
    Students Good morning, Miss Cheerilee! 
    Cheerilee Good morning, everypony! I hope you brought your thinking caps, because today we're going to learn about physics! 
    Scootaloo Physics? 
    Cheerilee Mm-hmm! Specifically, the use of force in energy conversions! In this case, using mechanical work to convert potential energy into kinetic energy! 
    Apple Bloom The what now? 
    Sweetie Belle Um, Miss Cheerilee? That sounds a bit over our heads. 
    Scootaloo Yeah. Why would we even need to know that stuff? 
    Cheerilee Oh, it's very important. In fact, you'll most likely end up using it tomorrow. 
    Apple Bloom Tomorrow? What for? 
    Cheerilee Why, for participating in the... Applewood Derby! 
     
    Snails Oh, phew! For a second, I thought we were gonna have to, you know, learn stuff. 

     

     
    Scootaloo We get to race in the Applewood Derby tomorrow? That's so cool! 
    Apple Bloom My family's talked about it for years, and now I'm finally old enough to race! 
     
    Cheerilee Now hold on to your horseshoes, everypony. You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race. 
    Snips Yeah, but... not schoolwork, right? 
    Cheerilee There'll be a block of applewood just like this one waiting for you at Sweet Apple Acres tomorrow, and you've got one day to turn it into a race-ready cart. 
     
    Scootaloo Oh, yeah... That is a lot of work. 
    Cheerilee Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each get to pick an older pony to help you! But choose wisely, because they'll also have to ride in the cart with you during the race. 
    Scootaloo Hmmm... I think I know just the pony to ask. 
    Sweetie Belle Me too! 
    Apple Bloom Me three! 
    Cheerilee Just remember, everypony. Your cart has to be able to finish the race if you want to win one of the awards. Fastest â€“ for winning the race, naturally. Most traditional â€“ for the best working replica of an original Applewood cart. And most creative â€“ for the cart with the best overall design. 
    Apple Bloom  Hoo-wee! Those ribbons are the bees' knees. 
    Students  Uh-huh... 
    Cheerilee All right then, class! You've got a lot to learn if you want to build a race cart. 
     
    Snips Aww... I knew there was gonna be a catch! 

    Sweetie Belle Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days? 
    Apple Bloom Yeah, I know all about them. When Ponyville started the Derby, they decided to use the wood from our apple trees for the carts. The race has been a part of Sweet Apple Acres ever since. 
    Sweetie Belle I just think these old carts look so cool! But I guess you and Applejack will probably win the award for the most traditional, huh? 
    Apple Bloom The Apples usually do, but honestly, I'd rather build the fastest cart there is and win the race! 
     
    Apple Bloom But... I'm pretty sure Scoot and Rainbow Dash'll take that award. 
    Scootaloo You know, I race around so much on my scooter, being the fastest isn't such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to make the wildest looking cart I can think of! 
    Apple Bloom Really? 
    Scootaloo Sure! If I win most creative, you can totally win the award for fastest! 
    Sweetie Belle And I can win the award for most traditional! 
    Apple Bloom Sounds like we're all gonna try somethin' different. I can't wait to tell Applejack! 
    Scootaloo Let's get to it! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Go, Crusaders! 

    Rainbow Dash Are you kidding?! Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby! I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly! 
    Scootaloo Wait, Cloudsdale has a derby too? 
    Rainbow Dash Sure! Practically every town in Equestria has one!  I still remember racing my cloud cart... 

    Young Rainbow Dash This is so awesome! Woo-hoooooo! 

    Scootaloo And lemme guess. You won fastest cart. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh, obviously! 
    Scootaloo So what do you say? Will you help me make my race cart? 
    Rainbow Dash Help you? I'm all over it! I've got tons of ideas. 
    Scootaloo Don't worry, I've got a lot ofâ€” Whoa. Ideas of my own. Um... 
     
    Scootaloo What are you looking for? 
    Rainbow Dash The blueprint for my derby cart, of course! I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds. But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing! 
     
    Scootaloo Um, okay, Rainbow Dash, thanks! How awesome is this? With Dash on my team, how could anything go wrong? 

    Applejack Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby didâ€” 
    Apple Bloom â€”start on our farm. I know. 
    Applejack Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional. 
    Apple Bloom Actually, I was kinda thinking of somethin' else. Like... fastest? 
    Applejack  Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern andâ€” 
    Apple Bloom Exactly! 
    Applejack Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like! 
    Apple Bloom I guess I do have a family tradition to uphold... 

    Rarity  Of course I'll help! 
    Sweetie Belle Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited. 
    Rarity Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago! 

    Rarity  I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second! 

    Sweetie Belle You? Second in most creative? To whom?! 

     
     
    Rarity  But I learned a valuable lesson. 

    Rarity I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold! 
     
    Rarity Chop chop! Everypony out! 
    Upper class ponies  
    Rarity We've got work to do! 
     
    Rarity This will take all of my considerable skills...  
     
    Rarity ...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative! 
    Sweetie Belle Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional? 
    Rarity Oh!  Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves! 
    Sweetie Belle You mean my hooves. 
    Rarity Yes, that's what I said â€“ my hooves. Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow! 
    Sweetie Belle Uh... how early? 

     
     
    Sweetie Belle  Rarity, the sun's not even up yet. 
    Applejack Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest! 
    Rarity And my cart wins most creative! 
    Applejack And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day! 
    Scootaloo You mean our carts, right? 
    Rarity Yes, that's what we said, darling. 
    Applejack Yup. 
    Rainbow Dash Our carts. 

    Apple Bloom Their carts? It almost sounds like they're planning on building them without us. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm sure they meant "our" carts. Like, the team cart, right? 
    Scootaloo Of course! I mean, they're all our older sisters. Practically. Plus, they've all done this before. I'm sure they know best. Let's just buckle down and get to work! 
     

     
    Scootaloo  
    Rainbow Dash Scootaloo, where have you been? I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever! 
    Scootaloo Uh, about that. I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize. I mean, I know all about speed already, so... 
    Rainbow Dash Exactly! It's all about speed! You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right? Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road. Bring them up here, would ya? Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart! 
     
    Scootaloo  Right... Fun... 

    Apple Bloom Spendin' time buildin' a cart with my big sister? Why, this is just tee-riffic! Um... how can I help? 
    Applejack You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, good. 
    Applejack But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom Actually, I was kinda thinkin' of somethin' a little more modern. And less rickety. With maybe a chance of winning? 
    Applejack Bless my hooves, I thought we covered this! Tradition is all that counts! And who knows tradition better than Apples? Nopony, that's who! So are you an Apple, or are you an Apple?  
    Apple Bloom I'm an Apple, but... what if I just take off this fringe? 
     
    Applejack No, not the fringe! 
     
    Applejack Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time! 
    Apple Bloom Oh. So, maybe we can redesign it then? Just a little. 
    Applejack No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect? 
    Apple Bloom Right... Perfect... 

    Sweetie Belle Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas. 
     
    Sweetie Belle How about a nice yellow fringe on top? 
    Rarity  the fringe is not exactly big! And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine! 
    Sweetie Belle Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this. 
    Rarity Sweetie Belle, precious face, "old-timey" is just another word for passÃ©. Remember, big and bold! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture! 
    Sweetie Belle But we're supposed to be doing this together! 
    Rarity Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, we just finished. Voila! I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't big and bold, I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful?  
    Sweetie Belle  Right... Wonderful... 

     

     
    Apple Bloom  Hey, Crusader... How's it goin'? 
    Sweetie Belle  Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart anypony's ever seen. 
    Apple Bloom Wow. Well, Applejack's built somethin' so traditional, it's practically an antique. 
    Scootaloo  No matter what I say, there's no talking Rainbow Dash out of making the fastest cart in Equestria. 
    Sweetie Belle Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted. 
    Apple Bloom But... I'm sure our older sisters know what they're doin'. Right? 
    Scootaloo Right... 
    Sweetie Belle Right. 
    Apple Bloom And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind, it'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line. 
    Sweetie Belle Sure! The race is the best part! 
    Apple Bloom Yeah! CMCs behind the wheels! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle  
    Cheerilee Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! 
    Rainbow Dash The race is about to start, Scootaloo! You better shake a leg if you wanna ride in the winning cart! 
    Rarity You, too, Sweetie Belle. There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you. Woo-hoo! 
    Applejack Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace â€“ slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom! 
    Apple Bloom Passenger seat?! 

     
    Scootaloo  They're the only older ponies driving! 
    Sweetie Belle First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?! 
    Apple Bloom I know they were all excited to help, but I don't think they're really helping anymore. 
    Scootaloo We better hurry if we wanna be a part of this race at all! 

    Cheerilee Um, aren't you all missing somepony? 
    Applejack They'll be along. 
    Cheerilee And, uh,  usually the younger ponies drive the carts. 
    Rarity  Darling, do these look like usual carts to you? 
     
    Cheerilee  Racers! On your marks, get set, go! 
    Sweetie Belle  
    Scootaloo  
    Apple Bloom  Can't we go any faster?! 
    Applejack Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect! 
    Apple Bloom  
     

    

        Go, go, go! 

    

        Check me out, racin' the Derby 
        Check out my old-fashioned cart 

    

        Check me out, racing the Derby 
        In my original work of art 

    

        Check me out, faster than ever 
        There's nopony can catch me now 

    

        Let me out, I'd do it over 
        If I only knew how! 

    

        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Go, go, go! 

    

        My cart's the most original 
        Designed with imagination 

    

        My cart's the most traditional 
        Just plain, no complications 

    

        Look at me, I am the ace 
        Might as well give up the chase 

    

        Wish we could stop this race 
        Start again and do it our way 

    Scootaloo Having any fun yet? 
    Apple Bloom Nope! Maybe if we could go a little faster! 

    

        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Go, go, go! 

    

        Gotta get some attention 
        If I want that ribbon 

    

        Gotta push the limit further 
        Blow away the competition 

    

        Gotta coast on through 
        Just relax, we're gonna cruise it 

    

        Guess I don't really care 
        Since we're clearly gonna lose it 

    

        See, everypony's watching 
        Presentation is a glory 

    

        Just passed you, even faster 
        Speed is king, end of story 

    

        Bigger, bolder down the track 

    

        Love the view from the back of the pack 

    

        Won't stop, we're on the attack 

    

        Too late to take it all back! 

    

        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Giddyup, derby racers 
        Go, goâ€” 

    Cutie Mark Crusaders Look out! 
     
     
    Rarity Oh! My beautiful swan cart is an ugly duckling! 
    Applejack And my old-time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck! 
    Rainbow Dash  It still counts as a win if I push my cart across, right? 
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders They're not your carts! 
    Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity Huh? 
    Apple Bloom We were supposed to design them! 
    Scootaloo And we were supposed to drive them! 
    Sweetie Belle The Derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you! Now you've ruined it for everypony! 
    Rarity Mmmh... 
     
    Rarity Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away... 
    Applejack But I thought you all wanted our help. 
    Apple Bloom We did! We wanted your help to build our carts. But we all ended up with carts that are what each of you wanted! 
    Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle Mm-hmm. 
    Rainbow Dash But why didn't you say anything? 
    Scootaloo You've all done the race before. I just figured you knew best! 
    Sweetie Belle Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies. 
    Rarity Oh, I certainly understand that. But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best. 
    Rainbow Dash And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you. 
    Applejack Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology. 
    Apple Bloom Maybe not just us. 
    Rainbow Dash  Um, how do you feel about a do-over? 
    Cheerilee I think that's a wonderful idea! But maybe the older ponies should sit this one out. 

    Scootaloo Thanks for helping us fix up our carts. Pretty creative, right? 

    Apple Bloom I know it's not traditional, but it sure looks fast, don't it? 

    Rarity You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all. 
    Sweetie Belle Thanks, everypony. We couldn't have done it without you. 
     
    Applejack Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again. 

    Cheerilee Well, it isn't every year I get to say this twice, but... Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! Racers! On your marks, get set... go! 
     
    Rainbow Dash And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines. But... what are we supposed to do now? 
    Rarity I think I have an idea. 

    Rarity  Ahhh! Much better! Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place. 
    Rainbow Dash Seriously!  This is the most relaxed I've been all day. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Go, Scootaloo, go! Woo-woo-woo-woo! Uhh, I mean...  

     

28 Pranks Later

     
    Fluttershy I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic. I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day. 
     
    Fluttershy Only... darker. 
    Harry  
    Fluttershy Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage. 
     
    Fluttershy Nothing to worry about. No reason to... 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy Ruuuun! 
     
    Fluttershy Aah!  
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Fluttershy  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy  That wasn't funny! You really scared me! I hope you're happy. 
    Harry  
    Rainbow Dash Nope. You're too easy. You're scared of everything. 
    Fluttershy That's not true. 
    Rainbow Dash Boo. 
    Fluttershy Aah!  
    Harry  

     

    Rainbow Dash I mean, how could you not appreciate that? 
    Fluttershy Because I don't think being scared is very fun! 
    Pinkie Pie I do! Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that part. But the rest is great! 
    Rainbow Dash See? Everypony likes a good prank! They're just jokes! 
    Rarity Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't. 
    Applejack And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy. 
    Rainbow Dash  Lazy?! 
    Twilight Sparkle A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing. 
    Pinkie Pie But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny? 
    Rainbow Dash And I can do funny. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle That wayâ€” 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie  
    Pinkie Pie Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny! 
    Twilight Sparkle Not really. 
    Applejack Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut. 
    Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie What?! 
    Rarity Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all. 
    Rainbow Dash Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not sure she understood what we meant. 

    Rarity I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform. 
     
    Sweetie Belle  Hmm. Not bad. 
    Rarity Huh.  "You asked for it." 
    Sweetie Belle What does it mean? 
    Rarity Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there. 
    Sweetie Belle So how do we get it down? 
    Rarity We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from! 
     
    Sweetie Belle Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake. 
    Rarity Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash  Gotcha! Ha-ha! How's that for effort? 

     
     
    Apple Bloom What's all this, Applejack? I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive. 
    Applejack Uh, yeah, sorry about that. But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful. 
    Apple Bloom Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep? 
    Applejack Not if I have anythin' to say about it. 
     
    Applejack See ya in the mornin', sugarcube. 

     
    Applejack Huh?! 
     
    Applejack Whoa! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Ha! Still think I'm lazy? Gotcha!  Pigpen... 
    Applejack  Ugh! Rainbow Dash! 
     
     

     
     
    Rainbow Dash  Gotcha! 

     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
     

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha! 

    Twilight Sparkle Pinkie! We need your help. 
    Pinkie Pie Okay! For what? 
    Rarity Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, no! She's been pranking up a storm! 
    Fluttershy Did she get you, too? 
    Pinkie Pie  Oh, yeah! She and Gummy both! 

    Rainbow Dash Boo! 
    Pinkie Pie Aaah!  

    Pinkie Pie They got me good. 
    Applejack Well, she needs to stop. 
    Pinkie Pie Stop? But pranks are so much fun! 
    Twilight Sparkle Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't. 
    All but Twilight  
    Rarity Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it! 

    Pinkie Pie Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you! 
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell you! 
    Pinkie Pie You do? Ooh! You go first! 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony? 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah!  It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about. 
    Rainbow Dash Here. Have a cookie. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! Thanks!  
    Rainbow Dash So, I got to thinking â€“ why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once? 
    Pinkie Pie Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Gah, wait! I mean, it's not. 
    Rainbow Dash You don't even know what it is yet! Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane. 
    Pinkie Pie And? 
    Rainbow Dash And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's gonna be so awesome! 
    Pinkie Pie Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny. 
    Rainbow Dash  What?! 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town reallyâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be hilarious! 
    Pinkie Pie  

    Rainbow Dash Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh, Pinkie? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash  Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, I haven't really  been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. You don't have any more, do you?! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. 
    Rainbow Dash Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss it! 
    Pinkie Pie Actually...  Unless you've got more cookies! 
    Rainbow Dash Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest. 
    Pinkie Pie  Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious. 

    Rainbow Dash All right, who's ready to sell some cookies? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Me! 
    Applejack Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night. 
    Rainbow Dash Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me. 
    Apple Bloom Come on, Applejack! Let's get started! 
    Scootaloo Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover! 
    Sweetie Belle We wanna hit every house in Ponyville! 
    Rainbow Dash Come on! You heard her! Every house in Ponyville!  

     
    Harry  
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  

     

     
     

    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack I think you three should be real proud. Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round. 
    Rarity You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash  Any minute now. 
    Applejack Uh... "any minute now" what? 
    Rainbow Dash Huh? Oh, uh, nothing! Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten? I mean, it's still early, right? 
    Rarity Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh. 
    Rainbow Dash You think? 
    Rarity Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now. 
    Rainbow Dash Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check. 

    Rainbow Dash What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where is everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They should all be running out into the streets! Unless everypony went to bed early... 

    Rainbow Dash Pinkie? 
     
    Rainbow Dash The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses! You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you? 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Mrs. Cake! Phew! Have you seen Pinkie? I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great. 
    Mrs. Cake  
    Rainbow Dash Uh... Mrs... Cake...? 
    Mrs. Cake  Cookies...! Cookies! 
    Rainbow Dash  Uh, I can see you're busy! I'll come back! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Uhh! 
    Pinkie Pie  Cookies...! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Mrs. Cake  More... cookies...! 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Mrs. Cake  Cookies...! 

    Mrs. Cake and Pinkie Pie  Cookies... cooooooooooooookiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeees... 
    Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake  
    Mrs. Cake and Pinkie Pie  Moooooore cooooookies... 

     
    Pinkie Pie  More cookies... 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Lyra Heartstrings and Twinkleshine  
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash  You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner! Something's going on with the Cakes! Well, not something exactly. I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies... 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Cooooooookies... 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Oh, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Coooooookies... 
    Spike  

    Rainbow Dash  Fluttershyâ€” 
    Fluttershy  Cooooooookies... 
    Harry  

     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Granny Smith  Cooooooookiiiiiiieeeeeeees... 
     
    Granny Smith  Cookies... 

    Applejack You sure you don't mind us all comin' over? 
    Rarity Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...? 
    Rainbow Dash Don't touch those! 
    Rarity Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on! We gotta get outta here! 
    Applejack What in tarnation are you goin' on about? 
    Rainbow Dash There's no time! You have to follow me! 
    Rarity Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else. 
    Rainbow Dash I don't want the cookiesâ€”! 
     
    Rainbow Dash But they do! 
    Rarity Wh-wh-what... What's happening? 
    Rainbow Dash I'll explain later. Come on! 

    Rainbow Dash  
    Sweetie Belle We need to find somewhere to hide! 
    Granny Smith Cookie! Cookie! 
    Applejack This way! 
     

     
    Rainbow Dash  Did we lose them? 
    Scootaloo  Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville? 
    Sweetie Belle What happened to all of our friends? 
    Rainbow Dash  I think it's something in the cookies. 
    Applejack Ugh! That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, unless there... is... 
    Rarity What are you saying? 
    Applejack What did you do? 
     
    Zombie ponies  Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee... coooooookiiiiiiieeee.... 
     
    Rainbow Dash Cover the windows! 
    Zombie ponies Coooook... 
     
    Zombie ponies  
    Rainbow Dash  Okay! So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine. 
    Rarity That's lovely, darling, except for one thing...  We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm... 
    Applejack  Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed... 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  Cooooooookiiiieeeees... 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Rainbow Dash No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these! 
    Pinkie Pie  But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...! 
    Rainbow Dash Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny! But this isn't funny at all! 
    Pinkie Pie  Exactly! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What? Wait... What's happening? 
    Rarity Just delighting in pranking the prankster. 
    Applejack  Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine? 
    Rainbow Dash So... you're... not sick? None of you are? 
    Pinkie Pie Of course not, silly! 
    Crowd Gotcha! 
    Rainbow Dash This... was all... a prank?! 
    Applejack Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you. 
    Pinkie Pie Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... 
    Scootaloo Wow! You should see your face! 
    Apple Bloom  Talk about funny! 
    Rainbow Dash  Well, I don't think it's very funny! And I'm the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go aroundâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle â€”pranking whoever you feel like? 
    Fluttershy Without thinking about how it might make them feel? 
    Rarity Or if they'd even enjoy it? 
    Applejack Or think it's funny? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah!  Ohhh. I see what you did there. 
    Pinkie Pie Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't. 
    Rainbow Dash I guess I did. I'm sorry, everypony. I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel. 
    Fluttershy Well, I hope you learned your lesson. 
    Rainbow Dash Totally! You ponies pulled off an amazing prank! I'll have to work extra hard to top it! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Gotcha. 
     

     

The Times They Are A Changeling

     
    Twilight Sparkle I hope Shining Armor and Princess Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal Empire for a visit. But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much already. I wonder if I'll even recognize her. 
    Starlight Glimmer She's the only baby they have, Twilight. I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Starlight Glimmer Sorry. I know you want to visit your niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again. I just don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, your work in Ponyville isn't going anywhere. Besides, I think we all know you can learn about friendship anywhere. Right, Spike? 
    Spike  "Spike?" Who's "Spike"? 
    Starlight Glimmer Pfft. Uh, you're Spike, Spike. And why are you dressed like that? 
    Spike  Guys, you're blowing my cover! How'd you even know it was me? 
    Starlight Glimmer Because you're you... in a coat, hat and glasses. Also, we're the only ones here. 
    Spike Right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, why do you need a disguise? 
    Spike Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street. 
    Starlight Glimmer I wouldn't say mobbed. 
    Spike And this is just a family visit. I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus. 
    Starlight Glimmer We get it. The Crystal Ponies adore you. 
    Twilight Sparkle He did save the Empire. Twice. But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus. 
    Spike Not if I find the right disguise, it won't. 

     

    Starlight Glimmer Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed. Nopony's here. 
     
     
     
    Spike It's like a ghost town. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got a bad feeling about this. 

    Starlight Glimmer Yeah, this is weird. 
    Spike I guess I don't need the disguise after all. 
     
    Glamour Gleam It's Spike the Brave and Glorious! 
    "Amber Waves" He's come to save us yet again! 
    Crystal Ponies Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike! 
    Spike Save you from what? 
    Starlight Glimmer Yeah, what's going on? 
    Twilight Sparkle Why was everypony hiding? 
    "Amber Laurel" Oh, it sure looks like Princess Twilight and her pupil. 
    "Scarlet Heart" But how can we be sure? 
    "Golden VÃ¤s" We can't! Either one of them could be the... you know! 
     
    "Amber Laurel"  the real Spike?! 
    "Scarlet Heart" Everypony, run! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. Something strange is definitely going on. 
    Spike  Ya think? 

    Royal guard 1 Who goes there? 
    Starlight Glimmer Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship? 
    Royal guard 1 Of course we recognize her. 
    Royal guard 2 But that doesn't mean it's really her. 
    Spike It's okay, guys. They're with me. And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right? 
    Royal guard 2 Huh. It does look like him. 
    Royal guard 1 Well, it would, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification. 
    Princess Cadance We'll take care of things from here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, Cadance, thank goodness! What's going on? 
    Shining Armor We can explain, Twily... if it really is you. 
    Princess Cadance Sunshine, sunshine... 
    Princess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle ...ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! Mmm! 
    Shining Armor It's okay, everypony. It's her. 
    Starlight Glimmer Of course it's her! What's all this about? 
    Sunburst A changeling's been spotted nearby. 
    Twilight Sparkle A changeling?! 
    Spike That's not good. 
    Princess Cadance No, it's not. After Queen Chrysalis took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of minions, we're not taking any chances. 
    Sunburst Changelings feed off of love. And ever since Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria. It's possible they've come for the baby. 
    Shining Armor That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we'reâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Checking everypony's identity. 
    Princess Cadance I'm sorry for all of this. Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you. 
    Flurry Heart  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, she's gotten so big! Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her. 
    Princess Cadance To be honest, having you here is already a big relief. 
    Royal guard 2  
    Shining Armor Hmm. The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling. 
    Spike Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike. It sounds dangerous. 
    Spike Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to. Have you ever known me to run from danger? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um... 
    Shining Armor He'll be safe with our guards. 
    Spike Or will your guards be safe with me? 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Royal guard 1 Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before. What can you tell us? 
    Spike Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can... change. 
    Royal guard 1  You hear that? These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards! Even more than normal. 
    Spike And they could be anywhere. 
    Royal guards  
    Spike So we should cover as much ground as possible. You, search that way! 
     
    Spike And you, search that way! 
     
    Spike And... I'll... just search... here, I guess. Not many places to hide. Unless that rock is a changeling. Okay, rock. How do I know you're really a rock? Hmm. Not talkin', huh? Well, you can't fool me! Uhh! Ow!  

    Spike Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Uhh! 
     
    Spike Phew!  Just my reflection. Huh? Ha! Ha-ha! Hmm. Just my imagination, I guess. 
     
    Spike  

    Spike Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling!  
    Thorax No, wait! Come back! 
    Spike  
     
    Spike  This is unexpected. 
     
    Thorax The ice is pretty slippery. I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me. 
    Spike You... saved me? 
    Thorax It's okay. I know you don't wanna be friends. 
    Spike Wait! I don't understand. Changelings are supposed to be evil... right? 
    Thorax Evil? Oh, not me. All I've ever wanted is a friend. 

    Thorax  From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive... 
     
    Baby Thorax  

    Thorax  I was part of the attack on Canterlot during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that! And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share it! 
     

    Thorax After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore. I set off looking for love to share, but... 
    Spike But... what? 
    Thorax I'm starving! And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now. It's what drew me here! But it's drivin' me crazy! 
    Spike That would be from the royal Crystalling. It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby. 
    Thorax  Oh, sorry! I'm just so hungry! If I had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think the Crystal Ponies want to be friends. 
    Spike What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try? 
    Thorax If only that were true. 
    Spike It is! I mean, I am! It's me, Spike! Spike the Brave and Glorious? I'm sure you've heard of me. 
    Thorax Nope. But I was raised by an evil queen. I'm Thorax. I can't believe you want to help me. 
    Spike Why? Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you? 
    Thorax  Uh! S-Sorry! Kindness like that kind of brings it out. Do you still wanna be my friend? 
    Spike Of course! And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too. 
    Thorax  
    Spike But... maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first. 
    Thorax  

    Royal guard 1 What do you mean? Did you see the changeling? 
    Royal guard 2 Did you defeat the evil creature? 
    Spike Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious? 
    Royal guard 1 Defeating two changelings? 
    Royal guard 2 Defeating all the changelings? 
    Spike Not having to fight the changeling at all! Because I made friends with him. 
     
    Royal guard 1 Oh, wow! For a second I thought you were serious! 
    Royal guard 2  Could you imagine? Friends with a changeling? 
    Spike I am serious. He wants to be friends! 
     
    Royal guard 2 Right! 
    Royal guard 1 Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious! 
    Royal guard 2  
    Spike I'm not joking! The changeling is nice! 
     
    Shining Armor I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny. The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me. 
     
    Shining Armor There's no such thing as a nice changeling. 
    Spike You're right, Shining Armor. Sorry. That was a... bad joke. 

    Thorax So? So? Uh, what did they say? How many new friends do I have? 
    Spike Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought. 
    Thorax  
    Spike I think I might know! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help. We're working on a protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you. 
    Spike Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh... Uh, Crystal, uh... Hoof! Crystal Hoof!  My good friend, Crystal Hoof. 
    Thorax Nice to meet you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too. How do you know Spike? 
    Thorax Oh, uh, Spike and I go way back. 
    Spike To the Equestria Games! That's when we met. We've been pen pals ever since. 
    Twilight Sparkle Pen pals? Spike! You could have been using my pen pal quill set! Why didn't you tell me? 
    Spike Well, I... I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are... studying. 
    Thorax I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious. 
    Spike Yeah.  
    Thorax and Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend. 
    Spike Great! Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city. 
    Thorax Oh, that was amazing! 
    Spike I told ya. 

     

    Royal guard 1  Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself. 
    Thorax  But I can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I? 
    Spike Relax. You're winning them over. Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling. 
    Princess Cadance Spike! Twilight told me you were off with a friend. 
    Spike  
    Princess Cadance And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine. 
    Flurry Heart  
    Thorax Oh, she's so beautiful! There's so much l-love around her...! I... I...! 
     
    Thorax  
    Princess Cadance  
    Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer  
    Thorax I...  ...stop! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! Get away from the changeling! 
    Spike Wait, no! You don't understand! 
    Sunburst This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby! What other explanation could there be?! 
    Spike I... 
    Thorax  
    Spike ...I don't know. 
    Thorax  
    Royal guard 1 After it! Don't let the changeling escape! 
    Princess Cadance I hope your friend is okay. 
    Spike Yeah... Me, too. 

    Royal guard 1 Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling. 
    Spike I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me. 
    Shining Armor Spread out! The changeling is probably still nearby! 
    Spike Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible.... But I bet I know where! 

    Spike Thorax! Hello? I just want to apologize! I should have stood up for you... Aw, come on, Thorax! I know you're in here! 
     
    Thorax Leave me alone!  
    Spike  Little help? 
    Thorax Why do you think I would help you? I'm an "evil changeling"! 
    Spike Because you're my friend. I just wish I had been one to you.  
    Thorax It's okay, I know it's hard. Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves you. I couldn't ask you to give that up for me. 
    Spike You don't have to ask. 
    Thorax What are you gonna do? 
    Spike What I should've done in the first place. 

    Royal guards Let's move! Move! Move! This way! This way! Let's go! Check there? Okay. Over here! Over here!  
     
    Royal guard Look around that corner! Over there! Over there!  
    Starlight Glimmer I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this really necessary? 
    Princess Cadance If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way. 
    Twilight Sparkle True. But Starlight has a point. This is getting a little out of hand. 
    Princess Cadance  I understand, but I don't know what else we can do. 
    Spike I do! 
     
    Shining Armor Spike! What are you doing?! Get away from that thing! 
    Spike No. He's not a "thing"! His name is Thorax, and he's my friend! 
    Royal guards and Shining Armor  
    Princess Cadance and Sunburst  
    Starlight Glimmer  

    

        Would you say I'm a hero 
        Glorious and brave 
        If I told you something you wouldn't believe? 

        That sometimes I'm scared 
        And I can make mistakes 
        And I'm not so heroic, it seems 

        But if day can turn to night 
        And the darkness turn to light 
        Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change? 

        No two ponies are exactly the same 
        No two snowflakes ever match their design 
        And I thought I was strong 
        But I was nothing but wrong 
        When I forgot to be friendly and kind 

        But if day can turn to night 
        And the darkness turn to light 
        Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change? 

        Would you say I'm a hero 
        Glorious and brave 
        If I told you something you wouldn't believe? 

        This changeling, it seems 
        Knows the real me 
        And would stay by my side 'til the end 

        So if day can turn to night 
        And the darkness turn to light 
        Then why can't we imagine 
        Just why can't we imagine 
        Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change? 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, I'm so proud of you. 
    Spike You are? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course! You're a celebrity here in the Crystal Empire, and you just risked all of it for a friend! I can't imagine anything more brave than that.  As the Princess of Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria. But today, it was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere. I guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship. Even me! And if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too. 
    Thorax Thank you. 
    Princess Cadance On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my subjects are eager to do the same. 
     
    Flurry Heart  
    Shining Armor Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax. I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you. Maybe we can change that now. 
    Thorax That'd be so amazing! I want to know all about friendship, and maybe one day I can take that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom! If my kind learned how to create love for one another, maybe they wouldn't have to take it from others! 
    Royal guard 1 To Spike the Brave and Glorious! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Looks like you were right after all. 
    Twilight Sparkle Right about what? 
    Starlight Glimmer Friendship lessons can happen anywhere. 

     

Dungeons & Discords

    Discord Tea? 
    Fluttershy  
    Discord Trendy coats? Bedrolls? Saddlebags? Oh! A surprise vacation just for the two of us? How thoughtful. I hear Puerto Caballo is lovely this time of year. Sand like powdered sugar.  
     
    Fluttershy Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out. 
    Discord  That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway. 
    Fluttershy If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac. 
    Discord  
     
    Discord You aren't kidding. 
    Fluttershy They're very nice. They have a "top secret" thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with them. 
    Discord Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite.  "Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!" 
    Opposite Fluttershy Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time! 
    Discord  Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see? 
    Fluttershy All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends.  Unless you're afraid they won't like you? 
    Discord Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that. 
    Fluttershy It never hurts to make new friends. 
    Discord  Consider it considered. 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Discord Couldn't I just come with you instead? 

     

    Discord I suppose this is goodbye then. Have an absolutely fabulous voyage.  
     
    Fluttershy Discord... 
    Discord  Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay. 
     
    Discord Oh, you're no fun.  
     
    Applejack I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our resident Yakyakistan expert. 
    Pinkie Pie Nope! I brought yeti food! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun! 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti! 
     
     
    Applejack Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us. 
    Twilight Sparkle I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike? 
    Spike I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls. 
    Twilight Sparkle Buh-bye! 
     
    Applejack Bye, y'all! 
     
     
     
    Big McIntosh  
    Spike  Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it... 
    Big McIntosh  Yup. 
     
    Discord Fascinating article, yes?  Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to. 
    Spike Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight? 
    Discord  Oh, here we go... 
    Spike Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do? 
    Discord Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening. 
    Spike  I guess guys' night will just be you and me. 
    Discord A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing? 
    Spike Eh, something like that.  You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two... 
    Discord That does sound fun, actually... 
    Spike Too bad you're busy. 
     
    Discord Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around. 
     
    Discord  In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair. 
     
     
    Discord  Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness. 
    Spike I do like basking in things. See you tonight.  Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown. 
    Discord Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas. 
     

    Spike And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike It's guys' night. 
    Big McIntosh Yup. 
    Spike Oh, yeah. 
    Big McIntosh Yup. 
    Spike Havin' fun now. 
    Big McIntosh Yup. 
    Spike Oh, yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Oh, yeah! 
     
    Spike What the hay? 
     
    Mini-Discord  Discord! 
     
     
     
    Discord So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short. 
    Spike Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games! 
    Discord Games? I love games. I'm great at games. 
     
    Discord Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh? 
     
    Discord Oh, come on! 
    Spike Uh... I'm talkin' about a real game. 
    Discord Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days. 
     
     
    Spike Not exactly. Wait here. 
     
    Discord Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix. 
    Spike  Okay! 

     
    Spike In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... Ogres & Oubliettes! 
    Discord  

    Discord Oh, this looks like... 
    Spike The best game ever? You're right! 
    Discord Yes... 
    Spike Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or...  as we call him... the Squizard! 
    Big McIntosh  
     
    Spike  Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much. 
    Discord Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me. 
     
    Spike First things first â€“ you've gotta create a character! Name? 
    Discord How about... Discord? 
    Spike  The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect. 
    Discord Just like in real life? 
     
    Spike And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception. 
     
    Discord  Go on, I'm listening. 
    Spike Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick! 
    Discord  I'm listening. 
    Spike When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor. 
    Big McIntosh Nnope! 
    Discord  I'm listening. 
    Spike And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard. 
     
    Spike So, your character's name? 
    Discord I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"? 
    Spike Captain Wuzz it is! 
    Discord  
    Spike What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues... 
    Discord  Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red. 
    Spike You'll love it once we get started!  How 'bout an Archer? 
    Discord Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine. 
     
    Spike Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Spike Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are youâ€” 
    Discord Oh, get on with it. 
    Spike  We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight. 
     
    Spike The bars exist in our imagination. 
    Discord Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real? 
    Spike It is real. In our imagination. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do? 
    Discord Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game. 
    Spike Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful. 
     
    Discord I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos. 
    Spike That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed.  Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad. 
    Discord This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip. 
    Spike You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell. 
    Discord I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid. 
     
    Spike  your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Discord  
    Spike The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too. 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
    Discord Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see. 
    Big McIntosh  
    Spike  As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder! 
    Discord I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing! 
    Spike I told you, you can't do magic! 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
     
    Big McIntosh Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope! 
    Discord "Not intelligent enough." Please. 
    Spike Cut it out, Discord! 
    Discord Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night! 
     

     
    Discord  This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape! 
    Discord I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes? 
    Spike  No, we want to go back to Ogres &â€” 
    Discord Oh, how 'bout a different game?  Those are very bad cards. 
    Spike Stop messing with us! We wannaâ€” 
     
    Discord A dance contest? 
     
    Discord Surprise! We won! 
    Spike Discord! 
    Discord  Yes? 
    Spike Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch. 
    Discord Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game.  Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes? 
     

    Spike Sir McBiggun?! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam! 
     
     
    Spike It's guys' night! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike Oh, yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Yup! 
    Spike In the game now! 
    Big McIntosh Yup! 
    Spike Oh, yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Oh, yeah! 
    Spike Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real! 
    Discord  Aren't games fun? 
    Spike Should we be worried he's using his scary voice? 
     
    Squizard Behold! I am the Squizard! 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
    Discord  You're welcome. 
    Squizard Attack! 

     
    Spike Run! 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
     
    Discord  You get the idea. 
     
     
    Discord Seventeen! Lucky you! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Discord Boo. 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
    Discord Boo. 
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
    Spike Discord! 
     
    Discord Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you. 
     
    Spike This isn't funny! 
    Discord Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?! 
     
     
    Spike Ugh! 
     
     
    Spike  This kinda hurts! Like, real pain! 
     
    Discord Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say? 
    Spike Discord, this is awful! 
     
    Squizard Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride! 
     
    Squizard I mean, Shmarity. 
     
    Spike and Big McIntosh  
     
    Spike Why are you doing this? You're the worst! 
    Discord If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me? 
    Spike Because we felt bad for you! 
    Discord Because you... what?! 
     

     
    Spike  We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to you, Discord! 
    Discord You felt sorry for me? 
    Spike Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone! 
    Discord This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you. 
    Spike  We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Discord I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh.  I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight. 
    Spike Good! 
    Discord Yes, so many other friends.  When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad. 
     
    Discord Oh, well. 
     
    Spike  It... it's better this way, right? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Spike Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends. 
    Big McIntosh Yup. 
    Spike  Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me? 
     
    Discord Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me? 
     
    Discord Uh...  No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss... 
    Spike What? 
    Discord I'm ssssssssâ€” 
    Spike Can't hear you. 
    Big McIntosh Nope. 
    Discord I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you!  Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we? 
     
    Big McIntosh  
    Spike Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit? 

     
     
    Mane Six Huh? 
     
    Spike I've got your back, Captain Wuzz! 
     
    Big McIntosh Wha-hah! 
    Discord  
    Spike, Big McIntosh and Discord  
    Squizard  
    Discord  Garbunkle! Follow my lead! 
     
    Squizard  
     
    Spike Bull's-eye! 
    Discord Nice one! 
    Spike and Discord It's guys' night! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike and Discord Oh, yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike and Discord Having fun now! 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup! 
    Spike and Discord Oh, yeah! 
    Big McIntosh Oh, yeah! 
    Twilight Sparkle We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is. 
    Rainbow Dash No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash Guys' night! 

     

Buckball Season

     
    Applejack  
     
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'? 
    Applejack Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, distance bucking? What for? 
    Applejack Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back! 
     
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack  
     
    Applejack So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question. 
    Applejack Hmm? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh... what's buckball? 
    Applejack  

     

    Rainbow Dash So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all! 
    Fluttershy Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I'm kind of an expert. 
    Applejack Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert. 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun! 
    Applejack The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours! 
    Fluttershy But, um, we don't have a team. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in. 
    Pinkie Pie  Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team. 
    Applejack We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one. 
    Pinkie Pie Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home! 

    Applejack I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it. 
     
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie. 
    Pinkie Pie Yaah! 
    Fluttershy Aah! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Ohhh. I get it. 
    Applejack And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team.  You two get the idea? 
    Pinkie Pie Absolutely! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast. 
    Rainbow Dash All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes. 
    Unicorn Player #1 Um, what do I do? 
    Rainbow Dash When the ball comes towards you, catch it. 
    Granny Smith  
    Applejack Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you. 
    Pinkie Pie  Aah! 
    Applejack  Nice kick. 
    Fluttershy Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whee!  
    Applejack Great save, Fluttershy! 
    Unicorn Player #2  
    Rainbow Dash Coming your way, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie Somersault kick! 
    Unicorn Player #1  
     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, this game is easy! 
    Fluttershy Ooh!  It actually is kinda fun! 
    Applejack Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that? 
    Rainbow Dash And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing. 
    Applejack Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do. 

    Applejack Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy Well, hello there, Mr. Ball. Whee! 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash Hiya! 
    Fluttershy Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you. 
    Sea Swirl Aah! 
     
    Applejack Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Nope. 

    Applejack Definitely not. 

     
    "Sweet Biscuit"  
    Rainbow Dash No. 

    Applejack Not a chance. 

    Rainbow Dash No. 
    Applejack Nope. 
    Rainbow Dash Aaaand... no. 

    Rainbow Dash  This didn't go how I thought it would. 
    Pinkie Pie Whee!  Whee! Ha ha! 
    Applejack It sure didn't. 
    Fluttershy This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be. 
    Pinkie Pie It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch! 
    

        Carryin' my water 
        My water, my water 
        Carryin' my water 
        On my shoulder pole 

    Pinkie Pie Snails! Look out! 
    Snails Hmm? 
     
    Applejack Amazing! 
    Snails You should be more careful with these. You could lose them. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here? 
    Snails Hmm? Sure. What do you want me to do with it? 
    Applejack Catch! 
    Snails Anything else? 
    Fluttershy Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball. 
    Pinkie Pie It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns. 
    Fluttershy Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team? 
    Snails I guess I'll find out. Plus, after I deliver this water, I don't really have anything else to do. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa! 
    Applejack Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be. 
    Fluttershy W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is? 
    Rainbow Dash  Uh, you two, obviously! 

    Fluttershy Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you? 
    Rainbow Dash Mm-hmm. 
    Pinkie Pie That's "uncredible"! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Unbelievable and incredible?  Come on! 
    Applejack I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple. 
    Rainbow Dash Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun. 
    Applejack Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team. 
    Pinkie Pie I do like fun! 
    Fluttershy Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time. 
    Pinkie Pie Let's get this party started! 
    Applejack All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious. 
    Fluttershy Serious? 
    Pinkie Pie Serious how? 

    Applejack With serious practice! 
    Fluttershy  Wow. This looks pretty intense. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us! 
    Applejack That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would. 
    Rainbow Dash So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you! 
     

    Rainbow Dash Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down! 
     
    Fluttershy I-I-I do? 
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Rainbow Dash It's all about ball control. 
    Fluttershy  Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?! 
    Fluttershy  Whoa! Ugh! 

    Applejack All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game. 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, if you say so. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee! Whee! Whee! Whoopee! Woo-hoo!  
     
    Pinkie Pie Whee! Woo-hoo! 
     
    Applejack Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! What?!  
     
    Pinkie Pie Whoops. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Come on! Push! Push! Push! 
     
     

    Applejack Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! Uhh! Ow. 

    Rainbow Dash Faster! 
    Fluttershy Whoa! 

    Applejack Come on now! 
    Pinkie Pie Wh-Wh-Whoa! 

    Rainbow Dash Come on! 
    Fluttershy Aah!  

    Applejack Keep it up! 
    Pinkie Pie Whoa! 

    Rainbow Dash Come on! 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack What in the apple happened to those two? 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know. They mopped the field with us before. 
    Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack All right! That's it for today, y'all! 
    Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie Phew! 
    Pinkie Pie I thought practice was supposed to make us better. 
    Fluttershy Maybe we just need a little rest. 
    Rainbow Dash Or a whole lot of it. 
    Applejack Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win. 

    Fluttershy I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident. 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe we weren't that bad! 
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't. 
    Fluttershy I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball? 
    Pinkie Pie I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team? 
    Fluttershy Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa? 
    Pinkie Pie Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all. 

    Crowd Go, Ponyville! Go, Ponyville! Win, win, win!  Woo-hoo! Ponyville! Way to go! 
    Snails Whoa. The whole town really seems to care about this game a lot. 
    Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie  

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little. 
    Applejack Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you! 
    Pinkie Pie  Greaaaaat... 
    Applejack I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good! 
    Fluttershy  It should...? 
    Rainbow Dash Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team!  I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in "the zone", I don't know what will! 
    Fluttershy I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you? 

    Rainbow Dash Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone! 
    Pinkie Pie  You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...! 
    Fluttershy There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Snails I'm still okay with playing, in case you were worried. 

     
    Rainbow Dash I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore? 
    Applejack Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! Andâ€” 
    Applejack Get serious and play hard andâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Get ready to totally smash the competition, andâ€” and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it? 
    Applejack  Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them. 
    Rainbow Dash  What do we do now? 

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Pinkie? Fluttershy? 
    Applejack We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train! 
    Fluttershy  Maybe you need to look again! 
    Pinkie Pie  Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here! 
    Fluttershy  And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa! 
    Pinkie Pie Or anypony else! 
    Applejack  
    Fluttershy Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa. 
    Rainbow Dash You don't have to play against Appleloosa. 
    Fluttershy We don't? 
    Applejack Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all. 
    Pinkie Pie  Why didn't you say so? 
    Rainbow Dash But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time. 
    Applejack Against us. 

    Applejack Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful. 
    Rainbow Dash Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout. 
    Applejack Yup. You two just do your best. 
    Pinkie Pie I can do that! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  
     
    Fluttershy  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack Ahem. 
    Fluttershy  Huh! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh!  
    Fluttershy Looks like you two really do need practice! 

     
     
    Pinkie Pie Hee-hee! Ha! Whee! 
    Snails  
    Fluttershy  If you need more practice, we can keep going. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! I could do this all day! 
    Rainbow Dash  No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are. 
    Pinkie Pie Wait... what? 
    Snails Finally! 
     
    Applejack You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, yeah! Weird! 
    Fluttershy But, um, why were we so terrible before? 
    Rainbow Dash I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out. 
    Applejack And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you. 
    Rainbow Dash And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good! 
    Fluttershy But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win? 
    Applejack I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that. 
    Fluttershy But how do we keep from worrying about it? 
    Snails You could do what I do and not think about it. Seriously. I don't think about anything. Ever. 
    Pinkie Pie Hm. Works for me! 

     
    Announcer And with another bouncing goal from Pinkie Pie, the score is tied! 
    Rainbow Dash You guys are amazing! 
    Pinkie Pie  Braeburn is really good! 
    Fluttershy So is that Pegasus. Oh, I don't know if we can win. 
    Snails You know what I would do? 
    Pinkie Pie Not think about it? 
    Snails Not think aâ€”  Oh, yeah. That. 
    Applejack Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not. 
    Lucky Clover  
    Pinkie Pie  I think it's more fun this way! 
     
    Announcer And Pinkie wins the buckoff! But her shot's rejected! Back to Braeburn, whose kick's stopped by another Fluttershy save! Next point wins. Lots of tense back and forth here. Fluttershy unleashes her patented spin move, but Braeburn's there toâ€” No! It's Pinkie with a somersault kick! What a move! And that's the game! Ponyville wins! 
    Crowd  Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! 
    Applejack Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression! 
    Braeburn Well, cousin, I have to admit. Your Ponyville team played a pretty good game. 
    Rainbow Dash Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you! 
    Braeburn Yup, you sure as shootin' did. I'm gonna have to get real serious about a strategy for our rematch. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I wouldn't get too serious. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun! 
    Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Snails  

     

The Fault in Our Cutie Marks

     
    Sweetie Belle So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about? 
    "Pearl Paleo" I'm sure you get these questions all the time. Oh, this is so awkward. 
    "Parry Paleo" Um, you're the experts, so we thought you'd have some insight into our daughter's new, uh, cutie mark. 
    Apple Bloom What's wrong? 
    "Pearl Paleo" Obviously, we're both very proud of her and her cutie mark... 
    "Parry Paleo" Despite its, um... unsettling nature. 
    Sweetie Belle Unsettling? 
     
    Apple Bloom I don't get what you mean. 
    "Pearl Paleo" Her mark doesn't... bother you at all? 
    Scootaloo Hey! Check out what we found! 
    Petunia Paleo Look! A spiny-backed ponysaurus! In our own backyard! And I found him on my very own! How cool is that?! 
    "Pearl Paleo" and "Parry Paleo" Oh!  She's an archaeologist. 
    Scootaloo Of course! What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate? 
     
    "Pearl Paleo" Pirate? Pfft! Why would we think that? 
    "Pearl Paleo" and "Parry Paleo"  

     

    Scootaloo Woo-hoo! Another successful cutie intervention! You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life. Like Bluenote here. Nice saxophone, Bluenote! 
     
    Apple Bloom Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose. 
     
    Apple Bloom You've gotta admit. We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny. 
    Scootaloo And started helping other ponies discover theirs! Could this get any better or what? 

    Sweetie Belle Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say... 
    Apple Bloom A griffon? 
    Sweetie Belle Ha! Exactly! Like a griffon. But that's just crazy talk. 
    Scootaloo Or not! 
    Sweetie Belle Is that really a griffon? 
    Apple Bloom You're darn tootin' it is! What do you think that griffon wants? 
    Sweetie Belle I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky? 
    Scootaloo Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully. 
    Gabby The Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it's really, really you!  
    Scootaloo  Aah! Ooh! This... griffon's... not... cranky. 
    Apple Bloom How in the blooming apples did you know who we are? 
    Gabby Know who you are? Know who you are?! Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville! I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now! Pleased to meet ya! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Apple Bloom Well, howdy... um... Gabby. 
    Gabby  I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything! 
    Sweetie Belle Excited? But whatever for? 
    Gabby What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world! 
    Scootaloo It's a calling, butâ€” 
    Gabby And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark! 
    Apple Bloom Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark? 
    Scootaloo I dunno, but I think we should probably find out. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  

    Scootaloo So, Gabriella... 
    Gabby Gabby, 'kay? 
    Scootaloo Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark? 
    Gabby  
    Scootaloo It doesn't seem like a very... griffon-y thing to want. 
    Gabby Right? Right?! Right?! 
     
    Gabby You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly. 

    Gabby  Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons. 
     
    Gabby  I'd do anything for any old griffon in need. 
    Elderly griffon Ahh! Uhh! 
    Gabby  But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome â€“ how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing â€“ I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own! 

    Gabby That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie!  Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet? 
    Sweetie Belle Uh, not exactly. 
    Gabby Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow? 
    Apple Bloom Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do. 
    Scootaloo I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark. It just sort of... happens. 
    Sweetie Belle Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it. 
    Gabby Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! Right?! Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark! 
    Sweetie Belle What she wants... It's not possible, right? 
    Scootaloo I don't know. But I know someone who just might. 

    Twilight Sparkle I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark. 
    Scootaloo But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her. There's gotta be something we can do. 
    Sweetie Belle Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Ohhh. Right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Crusaders, I'm sorry. While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are... pretty slim. Everything I've ever learned tells me. It's just not gonna happen. 
    Apple Bloom Oh, no! Poor Gabby! What the apples are we ever gonna tell her? 

    Sweetie Belle Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down. 
    Apple Bloom But what else can we do? 
    Scootaloo Hmm. You know what, Crusaders? So what? Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at. We can help her find her purpose! 
    Apple Bloom And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria. 
    Scootaloo All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her. Like, Crystal Empire clear. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Yeah! 

    Gabby Incoming! 
     
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Gabby Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible! 
    Scootaloo Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out. But not exactly in the way you think. See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie markâ€” 
    Gabby I'm getting a cutie mark!!! Woo-hoo-hoo!  
    Scootaloo Wait! You didn't let me finish! 
    Sweetie Belle Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer. 

    Gabby  
    Sweetie Belle She's still going. Anypony know if griffons ever get tired? 
    Gabby What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is! 
    Apple Bloom Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby. There's somethin' we need to clear up. We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen. 
    Gabby What?!? 
    Scootaloo It's true. Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark. 
    Gabby Oh!  Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right? 
    Apple Bloom Well, not exactly. 
    Gabby Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet. 
    Scootaloo You know what, Gabby? I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark. 
    Gabby Oh! It's gonna happen! I can feel it! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!  
    Sweetie Belle Aaaaand... she's off again. 
    Apple Bloom Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done? 
    Scootaloo I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach. And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't. Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad. 
    Sweetie Belle Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try. 
    Apple Bloom All right, but where do we even start? 
    Scootaloo Where we always do â€“ with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart. 

    Apple Bloom The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose. 
    Scootaloo Nopony gets a mark without one. 
    Gabby All right. Let's do this. 
    Scootaloo What are you good at? Do you play any sports? 
    Apple Bloom Or like to dance? 
    Sweetie Belle Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la! 
    Gabby Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even know what to pick! 
    Scootaloo Don't worry. That's what we're here for. 

    

        Like a racer at the starting line 
        You're chomping at the bit 

    

        You are here to find your purpose 
        And a place you really fit 

    

        And until you find your place in life 
        You're never gonna quit 

    

        We can help you find the purpose in your life 

    

        A griffon mixes lion's strength 
        With winged eagle's might 
        When I finally find my purpose 
        Then my cutie mark's in sight 

        Crusaders, I won't let you down 
        I've just begun to fight 
        You're gonna help me find the purpose in my life 

        Got a job that's just no fun? 
        Call on me, I'll get it done 
        Cauldron's stuck and needs a mix? 
        I'm the one who's got the fix 

        Help you teach pre-calculus 
        Scrub the floors, won't make a fuss 
        Clearing kelp? Just give a yelp 
        Raring to go, ready to help! 

    

        That's the spirit 
        You ought to see what you do best 
        Try it all, pick your fave 
        And leave behind the rest 

    

        I'll try anything 
        To get my cutie mark 
        Keep up with me, Crusaders 
        We're just getting our start 

        Rock your little ones to sleep 
        While hanging up the sheets 
        I can help you with your heavy load 
        Walk Granny 'cross the street 

        I'll run you 'round the bases fast 
        It's really no big feat 

    

        Can we help her find the purpose in her life? 

    

        Cheer you if you're feeling low 
        Plant your garden, make it grow 
        Write a piece for your quartet 
        Filling in on clarinet 

        Bake that cake as fast as lightning 

    

        She's so good at things, it's frightening 
        Cutie Mark Crusaders, 
        I think we've got a problem! 

    

        Build a boat 
        And sail it out across the sea 
        Need some help? 
        You know that you can count on me 

        CMCs, you're gonna help me find my purpose 
        The purpose in my life! 
        In my life! 

    Apple Bloom Now how we gonna do this? 
    Sweetie Belle Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right? 
    Apple Bloom It may as well be. I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all. 
    Scootaloo  And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible. I never should've gotten her hopes up! 
    Gabby I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches? 
    Scootaloo Gabby, we... we don't. 
    Gabby Wait. What are you saying? 
    Apple Bloom We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well... 
    Sweetie Belle We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do. 
    Scootaloo Gabby, we can't help you. 
    Gabby But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I won't believe it! 
    Apple Bloom Gabby, wait! 
    Scootaloo We're sorry! We're so, so sorry! This is just awful. For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures. 

    Scootaloo I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really thought we could help Gabby. 
    Sweetie Belle I thought we could help anypony. 
    Apple Bloom Maybe that's just it â€“ maybe we can only help ponies. 
    Scootaloo Or maybe we just plain failed. 
     
    Gabby Failed? Then what do you call this?! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders A cutie mark?! 
    Sweetie Belle What? You got your mark after all! Even though we couldn't find your purpose? Butâ€“ What? Huh?! How?! 
    Apple Bloom And what does it mean? A cauldron? 
    Gabby Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is! 
    Scootaloo This is awesome! We're not failures! Whatever we did worked! I had a feeling we could help you, and we did! 
    Apple Bloom Oh! We've gotta go see Twilight right away! She'll wanna know about this! 
    Sweetie Belle Correction â€“ she needs to know about this! I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own! 
    Gabby Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles! 
     
    Scootaloo Wow! Can you believe it? We were able to help her get her mark after all! Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight! 

    Twilight Sparkle Gabby? You just missed her. She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in. Just dropped this letter and zoomed away! 
    Scootaloo  "Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you. You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard. I'm heading home to tell all the griffons how you did the impossible by getting me my cutie mark. Toodles." 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Wait a second. Cutie mark? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?! You know what this calls for? A full-scale research project! 
    Sweetie Belle This makes no sense. Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark? 
    Twilight Sparkle You have got to get Gabby back here right away! I have so many questions! Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything! Spike! Guess what just happened! 
    Apple Bloom Weird. Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do? Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy. 
    Scootaloo We'd better find her and find out what's going on. Come on, Crusaders. 

    Scootaloo Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies. Gabby can't have gone far. 
    Apple Bloom She's not in the air. She's right there! Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'! 
    Gabby Um... Sorry, no time to chat. I-I just stopped to help this pony get out of the muck, and then I really gotta fly. Okay? Heave-ho!  
     
    Sweetie Belle Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us? 
    Gabby Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone! 
    Apple Bloom You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank? 
    Gabby  Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things. 
    Scootaloo Wow, Gabby. Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better? You must have been really upset. 
    Gabby Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make myself feel better. I wanted to make you feel better. 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders  
    Gabby I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth.  I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying. 
    Apple Bloom You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'. 
    Sweetie Belle I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you. 
    Scootaloo Hmmm... Maybe we can. Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse! 

     
    Gabby I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose. 
    Scootaloo Hang on a second. We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you. 
    Sweetie Belle Even us. How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you? 
    Gabby Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier. 
    Scootaloo So maybe helping is your thing! You might even say it's your purpose! 
    Gabby But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right? 
    Scootaloo Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something. It's about feeling good about something inside. 
    Apple Bloom And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours â€“ helping others. And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that. 
    Sweetie Belle But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold! 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Your very own cutie mark! Ta-da! 
    Scootaloo We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life. 
    Gabby But they look just like yours. You can't mean...!  
    Scootaloo You bet we do! You're one of us now! Gabby, today we dub thee... 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Woo-hoo! 
    Sweetie Belle You may not be able to get a cutie mark... 
    Apple Bloom But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow. I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that. 

    Gabby Awesome! My very own cute-ceaÃ±era! 
     
    Apple Bloom Oh, land sakes! You sure have earned it. 
    Sweetie Belle And so have we! Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing. Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end. 
    Scootaloo 'Course! Helping's what we do, right? 
    Gabby  I am so grateful! I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone! I promise. 
    Scootaloo Promise us one other thing, too? 
    Cutie Mark Crusaders Come back soon! 
    Scootaloo After all, you're a Crusader now. Crusaders forever? 
    Gabby Crusaders forever! 

     

Viva Las Pegasus

    Applejack The map is sendin' us where?! 
    Fluttershy Las Pegasus?! 
    Applejack But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party! 
    Fluttershy All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds... Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like either of your cups of tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job. 
    Applejack Probably not as bad as we think. It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right? 
     
    Fluttershy Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought. 
     
    Applejack You're right. It's worse! 

     

    Applejack and Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy Do you think the map could be on the fritz again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even Rainbow Dash. 
    Applejack If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I. All we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home. 'Course, we have to find it first. 
    Barker And make sure to experience our signature show, Ponet Fantastique! Trust me when I say you've never seen anything like it! Unparalleled acrobatics! Unique animal antics! Your only regret will be that you didn't see it sooner! And like everything at this amazing, incredible, I-can't-believe-it-even-exists hotel, Ponet Fantastique is brought to you by the chairpony of kindness â€“ Gladmane himself! 
     
    Fluttershy Wow. This Gladmane sure seems impressive. 
    Gladmane Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it. Uh-huh-huh. 
    Applejack Mr. Gladmane? 
    Gladmane Just Gladmane'll do. And it's a pleasure to meet actual cohorts of the Princess of Friendship! Thank you for coming. Thank you very much. 
    Fluttershy You know who we are? 
    Gladmane I'm what you might call a friendship connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends of the great Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here. Uh-huh-huh. 
    Applejack I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus. 
    Gladmane  Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are customers, but I can't help but thinkin' of each and every one of you as friends. That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh! 
     
    Gladmane Would you two like to take a tour of the place? I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here. 
    Fluttershy  We do have a friendship problem to find. 
    Applejack Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane! 
    Gladmane Just Gladmane now, you hear? 

    Trapeze Star  Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move! 
    Gladmane New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what. 
    Trapeze Star Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this! 
    Gladmane Stellar! Uh-huh-huh! 
    Director Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine! 
    Gladmane Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy. 
    Applejack Howdy! 
    Fluttershy Hi. 
    Director If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career. 
    Gladmane Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work. 
    Applejack  Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here. 
    Fluttershy  I've never seen a pink prairie dog before! 
     
    Gladmane I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh. 
    "Roar Horn" Und we love him for it! 
    "Sprigfield" With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care of all these little guys! 
    Fluttershy Now this place is overwhelming in a good way! 
    Gladmane Aw, glad you like it. 
    Applejack  Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy Hmm? Oh, um, coming! 

    Fluttershy There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all. 
    Applejack I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine. 
    Flim Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Ponet Fantastique! 
    Flam Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the show-stopping exotic animal act that Ponet Fantastique includes! 
    Fluttershy Those voices sound familiar. 
    Applejack They sure do. Flim and Flam. 
    Flim Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount! 
    Flam But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price! 
    Flim Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride! 
    Flam  Charlatan? How dare you! 
    Flim Hah! How dare I?! 
    Flam  Yes, how dare you! I was the one that... 
    Flim  I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine! 
    Flam  I'm two minutes older than you â€“ don't you forget that, brother of mine! 
    Flim  I'm sick and tired of this... 
    Flim and Flam  
    Fluttershy They certainly don't seem to be getting along.  You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them? 
    Applejack Absolutely not! 

    Flim and Flam  
    Fluttershy I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it. 
    Applejack Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them! 
    Gladmane I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made matters worse. 
    Applejack Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you! 
    Gladmane Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear? 
    Fluttershy I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam... 
    Applejack And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it! 
    Fluttershy  

    Flim I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother. 

    Flam Brother? I don't believe I have one of those. 

    Flim No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble becoming a big success on his own! 

    Flam "Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it. 

    Fluttershy I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other. 
    Flim and Flam I'm never speaking to that pony again! 
    Fluttershy  

     
    Director  You are ruining my show! 
    Trapeze Star It isn't just your show, and I'm improving it. 
    Director You don't pull a rabbit out of a hat on the trapeze! 
    Trapeze Star That's the point â€“ to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic! 
     
    Bernard Rabbit Ta-da! 
    Trapeze Star It's called "blending genres", and it's awesome! 
    Applejack Shouldn't somepony do somethin'? 
    "Back Stage" Hah. They've been doing this since they started working here. Too bad, really. If they ever stopped shouting at each other, we could take the show on tour. They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's. 
    Applejack Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem! 
    "Roar Horn" Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! 
    "Sprigfield" Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative! 
    "Roar Horn" Whaâ€” You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything? 
     
    "Sprigfield" I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid! 
    "Roar Horn"  You are driving me crazy! 
    Applejack I thought you two got along. 
    "Sprigfield" We used to, but we just can't seem to agree on anything anymore. We used to perform all over Equestria, but if we can't agree on a new act, we might as well stay at Gladmane's forever.  
    Applejack Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'! 

    Fluttershy If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place! 
    Applejack Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem. 
    Fluttershy It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting. 
    Applejack Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't. 
    Fluttershy Do you think he knows? 
    Applejack I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out. 

    Trapeze Star Of course Gladmane wants everypony to get along. He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met. Did the director put you up to this? 
    Bernard Rabbit  

    Director I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage. But if you are speaking of him poorly, you leave! 

    "Roar Horn" Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle... 
    "Sprigfield" ...most compassionate pony I've ever known! 
    "Roar Horn" and "Sprigfield" My problem... is with him! 
     

    Applejack I just can't figure it! The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have! 
    Fluttershy Well, Bernard â€“ that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act â€“ claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true! 
    Applejack  
    Fluttershy And the Flying Prairinos â€“ the pink prairie dog family â€“ say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it! 
    Applejack So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose! 
    Fluttershy But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing? 
    Applejack There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth! 
    Fluttershy Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster. 
    Flim and Flam  
    Fluttershy Or maybe a pair of ponies? 
    Applejack  Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe. 

    Flim Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville. 
    Fluttershy But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours? 
    Flam Because the only problem I have is standing right there. 
    Flim Same here, buster! 
    Applejack Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over? 
    Flim Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea! 
    Flam Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks! 
    Applejack Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did? 
    Flim Why would he lie? 
    Fluttershy Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort. 
    Applejack And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth becauseâ€” 
    Flim and Flam You never lie! 
    Flam Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback! 
    Flim The Canterlot Two-Step? 
    Flam Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flair? 
    Flim Ah, my flair isn't what it used to be. 
    Gladmane  Listen here, y'all! If you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much. 
    Flim Are you thinking what I am? 
    Flam The High Roller Hustle! 
    Applejack The what now? 
    Flam Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That is, assuming you two are willing to help. 
    Flim What size gown do you wear? 

     
    Gladmane Wh-What's all the fuss, now? 
    Flim It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria. 
    Gladmane Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch. 
    Flim Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's planning a resort of her own.  I think she's here to scout the competition. 
    Gladmane  Oh, really? 
    Flim And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants! 
    Gladmane  
    Flim Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof... 
    Gladmane  Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh. 
    Fluttershy  
    Flam You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money. 
    Fluttershy  
    Flam She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour? 
    Gladmane Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I can get ready. 
     
    Fluttershy Are all of you sure this is a good idea? 
    Flim Abso-tively! 
    Flam Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good! 
    Applejack I sure hope you two know what you're doin'. 
    Flam Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game... 
    Flim No two ponies do it better than us! 
    Applejack Can't argue with that. 

     
    Flam Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about? 
    Gladmane Actually, there's something I want you to see â€“ the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine. 
    Flam  
    Gladmane And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this. 
     
    Gladmane  Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Ponet Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much. 
     
    Gladmane Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her. 
    Flam Well uh, now that you mention it... 
    Gladmane And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side. Think you might consider staying here? 
    Flam Um... 
    Gladmane Well all right then. 

    Applejack They're comin'! 
    Gladmane And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown. 
    Fluttershy  
    Flam Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long. 
    Gladmane Oh? And why's that? 
    Fluttershy  
    Flam Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor? 
    Gladmane  with how I handle my employees. 
    Flam And how is that? 
    Gladmane  Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve. 
    Flam  ...nothing else? 
    Gladmane Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?! 
    Flim You knew the whole time? 
    Gladmane Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh.  Yeah! 

     
     
    Gladmane I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now. 
    Fluttershy Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean! 
    Gladmane Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the "High Roller Hustle". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead. 
    Applejack Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession! 
    Gladmane Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait! 
    Fluttershy  Did that sound okay? 
    Flim and Flam Never better! 
    Applejack  Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of the plan! 
    Gladmane Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything! 
    Director I think you've done enough of that! Darling? 
    Trapeze Star Hmph! 
    "Roar Horn" Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship! 
    "Sprigfield" And our act. Good luck finding another one! 
    Gladmane Wait! No! Y'all come back! Come on, I-I'm gonna be ruined! This is Gladmane's, y'all! Come on, you can't do this to...  
    Applejack Gladmane has left the buildin'! 

     
    Fluttershy I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all. 
     
    Fluttershy If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing. 
    Applejack And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster.  Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use. 
    Flam In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
    Flim Emphasis on "once". 
    Fluttershy  What do you mean? 
    Flam  While this establishment undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the Ponet Fantastique Theater â€“ at half the normal cost of admission! 
    Flim  And while you're appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill the space at no additional charge! 
     
    Applejack Flim and Flam! 

     

Every Little Thing She Does

     
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Twilight Sparkle  I've prepared a full day of spells. You've been doing great, but now it's time for a real challenge! 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh-ho-ho! It is on! Where do we begin? 
    Twilight Sparkle Teleportation! Multiple locations! Try to keep up! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Transfiguration! 
     
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer  

    Twilight Sparkle Shields! 
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Whoo! I am on fire! What's next? 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe there is such a thing as too much studying. 
     

     

    Starlight Glimmer As you know, speed spells like Accelero are not easy. But if done correctly, they can allow you to be much more efficient with your day. 
     
    Spike Way to go, Starlight! 
    Starlight Glimmer  Now I'm finished. 
    Twilight Sparkle I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed. 
    Starlight Glimmer  I've always been something of a natural. 
    Twilight Sparkle However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie. 
    Starlight Glimmer Are you sure? I could've sworn there were a couple in there somewhere... 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm sure. 
    Starlight Glimmer I see... Well, I'm really quite busy this week. So many commitments. I'll try and find some time in myâ€” 
     
    Twilight Sparkle No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be... 
    Spike Twenty moons from now? 
    Twilight Sparkle Tonight. It's a quick presentation. 
    Spike  Sure, keep telling yourself that... 
    Twilight Sparkle You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening. 
    Starlight Glimmer  Of course! No problem! Friendship lesson... On it... 
    Twilight Sparkle Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object. 
    Spike  

     
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Huh? Huh!  Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. 
    Spike Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left. 
    Starlight Glimmer Nope, not at all! I'm good here. Oh, not good â€“ great! Not a problem in the world! Heh. 
    Spike  Uh-huh. So... what are you doing, exactly? 
    Starlight Glimmer I... was... just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in Canterlot. Bap-ba-du... Oh, yep, right here, where I just left them a second ago. 
    Spike  "Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie," "scrapbook with Applejack," "sew with Rarity..." 
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Spike "Help an animal with Fluttershy," "chillax with Rainbow Dash?" What is chillaxing? 
    Starlight Glimmer No idea. 
    Spike You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so. 
    Starlight Glimmer Nervous, me?  Oh, Spike, you really are hilarious, ha-ha. You think I'm nervous that I'm gonna fail something as simple as baking a cake? 
    Spike Well, if you were, it'd beâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Silly! Twilight just said how impressed she was that I combined a speed spell and a duplication spell. That was a challenge. These? Pfft, hah! I could combine all five of these at the same time without breaking a sweat. 
    Spike I think maybe you're missingâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer An opportunity to really impress Twilight?  Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna get right on that! Good talk. 
    Spike And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out. 

    Starlight Glimmer So, with your help, I figure these should be done in no time. 
    Applejack Are you sure this is what Twilight would want? Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these. 
    Starlight Glimmer But by working as a team, we can get them done faster. And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship? 
    Applejack I... guess. 
    Starlight Glimmer Super! Pinkie Pie, since we're baking, you will be in the kitchen. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Starlight Glimmer Rarity, Applejack, you two can set up in the library. 
    Rarity Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting. Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer. 
    Starlight Glimmer I thought that Fluttershy and I could work with the animals right here in the foyer. 
    Fluttershy Oh, um, whatever you think is best. 
    Starlight Glimmer Great. Now, Rainbow Dashâ€” 
    Fluttershy It might depend on the animal. For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers. 
    Starlight Glimmer Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. 
    Fluttershy And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere. Maybe if you spend some time getting to knowâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer In a minute, Fluttershy. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle. We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, I just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere. 
    Rainbow Dash Heh. Shows what you know about chillaxing. Let me do some location scouting. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Okay... It seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking, so we can just get it out of theâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we start with me? We're gonna need time for the cake to bake! After all...

        It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cakeâ€” 

    Starlight Glimmer Uh, we're on a schedule, no time for a song. We can start with baking, thenâ€” 
    Rarity But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie.  She can be a bit messy. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Mmm! 
    Starlight Glimmer Fine. We can start with the dresses, and thenâ€” 
    Applejack While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'. We got a whole lot of time to cover. 
    Starlight Glimmer How much is a whole lot? 
    Applejack We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through. 
    Starlight Glimmer Eighty moons?! 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. There is nowhere to chillax in this castle! We're gonna have to set up somewhere else. 
    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie  
    Starlight Glimmer Could you all excuse me for... one... second? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Wow. That pony really needs to chillax. 

     
    Starlight Glimmer  Maybe if I cast a little spell to help things along... Something simple and safe. Fiducia Compelus... That's not bad. They would barely notice it, but... is it enough? Oh... Maybe Cogeria so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe Cogeria combined with Fiducia Compelus! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of Persuadere to be sure it sticks. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Everypony'll probably thank me for getting it all done so quickly. And Twilight will be thrilled I've completed so many lessons. Everypony wins! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Congratulations, Starlight. You're a genius.  Maybe the congratulations were a little premature... 

    Starlight Glimmer Cogeria... Persuadere... Fiducia... Hmm. Ah! Of course! Fiducia Compelus needs a trigger.  Ponies! Hear my voice and listen! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity, Applejack, library. Fluttershy, stay here. Rainbow Dash, find somewhere inside the castle and set up a place where we can chillax. 
    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie  

     
    Starlight Glimmer Let's get to work, Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie  Okie-dokie! What would you like to do first? 
    Starlight Glimmer Uh, what are we supposed to do first? 
    Pinkie Pie  Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer. 
    Starlight Glimmer  add baking soda, salt and cinnamon! Hmm. I think you can take it from here. 
    Pinkie Pie  Take what from where? 
    Starlight Glimmer The baking. Just keep following the instructions in the book until I get back. 
    Pinkie Pie  Abso-tively! Instruction following starting... now! 
    Starlight Glimmer Baking a cake â€“ check! Now on to sewing! 
     

    Starlight Glimmer What did you have in mind, Rarity? 
    Rarity  Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer. 
    Starlight Glimmer Can you make a dress exactly like that one? 
    Rarity  Just like this one? 
    Starlight Glimmer Just like it. 
    Rarity  Absolutely. It will look perfectly divine. 
    Starlight Glimmer That's a whole lot of photos. How do you usually organize them? 
    Applejack  However you want me to organize them, Starlight. 
    Starlight Glimmer Okay. Tell me about this one. 
    Applejack  Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago. Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin. She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there. She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there. 
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh. I don't need every little detail. Heh. Just sum up the story in one sentence. 
    Applejack  Huh. Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke. 
    Starlight Glimmer Uh-huh... Why don't you keep putting these photos in chronological order, and when I come back, you can give me more... highlights? 
    Applejack  Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer. 

    Starlight Glimmer Fluttershy, where are all the animals? 
    Fluttershy  They ran away. 
    Starlight Glimmer And why didn't you stop them? 
    Fluttershy  Because you didn't ask me to. 
    Starlight Glimmer Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer? 
    Fluttershy  All the animals. Got it. 
    Starlight Glimmer Did you find a place to chillax, Rainbow Dash? 
    Rainbow Dash  Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer! 
    Starlight Glimmer Great. Let me know when it's ready. 
    Rainbow Dash  Yes, Starlight Glimmer. 

    Applejack  Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, "If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!" Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him! 
    Rarity  Starlight Glimmer. I have finished the dress. Isn't it gorgeous? 
    Starlight Glimmer What is that? 
    Rarity  You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book. 
    Starlight Glimmer  Go make a real dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book. 
    Rarity  Ah. I see. Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Rarity! Make it bigger than the one in the book. 
    Rarity  Of course, darling. Bigger it is. 
     

    Applejack  She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her. 

     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Pinkie, what are you doing?! 
    Pinkie Pie  Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer! 
    Starlight Glimmer I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast? 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Starlight Glimmer Think the baking lesson is done. 
    Harry  
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, what now? 
     

    Applejack  They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom! 
    Starlight Glimmer What's going on?! 
    Harry  
    Fluttershy  I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer. 
     
    Rarity  Oh, yes, this will do nicely. 
     
    Rarity  A much bigger dress! 
    Applejack  It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples... 
    Starlight Glimmer  I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Starlight Glimmer What did you say? 
    Pinkie Pie  The cakes are burning. You left the ovens on. 
    Starlight Glimmer We need water! 
    Rainbow Dash  Yes, Starlight Glimmer. 
    Starlight Glimmer Storm clouds?! 
     
    Harry  
     
    Applejack  Big Mac told me, "With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility." 
    Starlight Glimmer  This can't get any worse! 
    Twilight Sparkle What is going on?! 

     
     
    Spike I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again! 
    Starlight Glimmer Maybe if I had reversed the Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria... Or maybe I added too much Persuadere... What? 
    Spike You're really missing the point here. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel that in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got this out of control. 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, it was the first time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversedâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle I think you might be missing the point here. 
    Spike Told ya. 
    Twilight Sparkle What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea? 
    Starlight Glimmer Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's because it is really bad! 
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this. 
    Starlight Glimmer Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why? 
    Starlight Glimmer I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice? 
    Twilight Sparkle Baking a cake freaks you out? 
    Starlight Glimmer Yes! Baking a cake, sewing â€“ all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake? 
    Starlight Glimmer But the lessonâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here. 
    Spike Told ya. 
    Starlight Glimmer So now what? 
    Twilight Sparkle Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing. 

    Applejack  I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh, tell me about it. 
    Rarity  If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful. My head is thumping...! 
    Fluttershy  I was up all night calming the animals down. 
    Rarity  Fluttershy, please! Not so loud... 
    Pinkie Pie Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake! I never burn cake! 
    Starlight Glimmer Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night. 
    Applejack Well, ain't that the understatement of the day. 
    Pinkie Pie Hmph! Tell it to the cake, sister! 
    Rarity  Can we all please argue at a lower volume? 
    Starlight Glimmer I really messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya â€” don't cast spells on your friends! 
    Starlight Glimmer Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders. 
    Rainbow Dash That was a pretty good apology. 
    Fluttershy Seems like she feels pretty bad. 
    Applejack Hey, Starlight! Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage. I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down. 
    Fluttershy Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats. I should check on them. 
    Rarity Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out. I should come and move it to that nice quiet library. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom. 
    Pinkie Pie Fine! Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy! 

     

    Twilight Sparkle It seems your apology went well. 
    Starlight Glimmer  I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again. 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you mean? You've been doing them all day. 
    Starlight Glimmer What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity? 
    Starlight Glimmer Yes, butâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie â€“ those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing. 

    Starlight Glimmer Sun â€“ check. Chairs â€“ check. And thanks to a simple Catadupa Levitata spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax? 
    Rainbow Dash Nope. 
    Starlight Glimmer No? What did I miss? 
    Rainbow Dash Quiet. 
    Starlight Glimmer Ah! Right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Great job, Starlight. Looks like you've completed another friendship lesson.  
    Rainbow Dash Hey! She completes the lesson when I say she completes it. So less learning and more chillaxing! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer So... How long do we sit quietly? 
    Main cast  

     

P.P.O.V. (Pony Point of View)

     
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack are getting back from their Seaward Shoals boat trip, and I can't wait to hear all about it! It's such a shame Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to miss it for their Cloudsdale flight school reunion. Maybe the rest of us not going was for the best anyway. I know the three of them were really looking forward to getting out of their element. 
    Spike Getting out of their element? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think they all just wanted to try something new. 
    Spike Huh. I guess a boat trip qualifies as that. 
    Twilight Sparkle My only worry is that they'll be so excited, they'll talk over each other, and I'll miss some of the details! Just to be safe, I may need you to take notes. 
     
    Spike Uh... right. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle So how was the trip? 
    Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie  
    Spike Well, at least you don't have to worry about them talking over each other. 

     

    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what happened on that boat trip. But once Rarity, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie have some tea and talk it out, I'm sure everypony will feel better. 
     
    Spike  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Come on in, everypony! Gummy, Opalescence, and Winona? This is a surprise! 
    Spike Aren't Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack with you? 
    Opalescence  
    Twilight Sparkle  "Sorry, darling, but I must decline the invitation to your soiree. While I'm sure it will be positively resplendent, there are certain ponies I'd rather not associate with at the moment. Rarity." 
    Spike Rarity's not coming? Awww. So I polished my scales for nothing. 
    Twilight Sparkle  "Sorry I can't make it, but I'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. Applejack." "Sorry I can't make the tea party today, but there's a small problem with the guest list. Plus, I'm right in the middle of a very important cupcake. Pinkie." Come on, Spike! Since our friends won't come here and tell us what happened, we'll just have to go to them! 
    Spike Right behind you!  

     
    Rarity  
     
    Rarity I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life! Ruined, completely ruined. 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Rarity. Maybe you couldâ€” 
    Rarity Throw it away? Yes, I agree. Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip. 
    Twilight Sparkle About that. Spike and I were wondering what happened out there. 
    Rarity Please, darling. I don't know if I'll ever be able to discuss it. It's far too painful!  
    Spike If it's too difficult to talk about, we completely understand. 
    Rarity Well, since you dragged it out of me... It all started at the docks. I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise. 

    Rarity  All right, ponies! Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas! 
    Pinkie Pie That sounds... fun? 
    Applejack  The sea air carries a portent for trouble this day. 'Tis a treacherous and perilous journey that lies ahead of us! We sail to adventure... or our very doom. 
    Rarity I... have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy. 

    Rarity  Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, I was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise. I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy. 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, I brought food too! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Let's see, I've got cotton candy, taffy, circus peanuts, and lots of other super-yummy stuff! 
    Rarity Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable. But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches. Dig in! 
    Pinkie Pie Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. 
    Applejack  Arrr! Get those off me ship! 
     
     
    Rarity Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers! 
    Applejack  Yar-har-har-har, hardy-har-har-har! 

    Twilight Sparkle Hmm... That doesn't sound like Applejack. 
    Spike Huh. 
    Rarity Well, hold on, because it gets even worse. Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games. 

    Pinkie Pie It's piÃ±ata o'clock! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity? 
    Rarity Oh, darling, of course! 
     
    Applejack  I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart of that maelstrom! 
    Rarity Ahem. Er, Applejack? Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters. 
    Applejack  This be the only way to Plunder Cove! 
     
     
    Rarity Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly pathâ€” 
    Applejack  Yah! There'll be no mutiny aboard me ship! 
    Pinkie Pie Look at me! I'm the captain too! 
    Rarity  Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness. 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity  
     
    Applejack  
     

    Spike Then what happened?! 
    Rarity Oh, the boat sank. Obviously.  

    Twilight Sparkle So Applejack got some sort of sea madness and caused the boat to capsize? 
    Rarity After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, that is how Applejack thanked me! 
    Spike So you were stuck out in the middle of the ocean? How in Equestria did you get back? 
    Rarity  Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further! 
    Twilight Sparkle Rarity, I don't suppose there's any chance you might be... uh, exaggerating things? Just a little? 
    Rarity Well! I can assure you that that is exactly what happened! But if you don't believe me, you can ask Pinkie Pie. I'm quite certain her story will be the same. 

    Pinkie Pie So that's what Rarity said happened on the boat, huh? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle We thought there was a chance she might have...  embellished the story just a tad. So we wanted to hear about what happened from you! Did Applejack really capsize the boat? 
    Pinkie Pie Of course not! Pfft, that's just silly! There's no way Applejack could've sank the boat! 
    Twilight Sparkle I knew it! 
    Spike That's a relief. 
    Pinkie Pie Because Rarity did! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Spike What?! 
    Pinkie Pie It all started on the docks. I knew Rarity and Applejack wanted to get out of their element, so I figured I'd throw them the funnest, silliest boat party ever! But I guess Rarity had other ideas. 

    Pinkie Pie  I thought I overpacked until I saw Rarity and her team of porter-ponies! 
    Rarity Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise! A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance! 
    Pinkie Pie  That sounds fun. 
    Applejack Ahoy, mateys! Batten down the hatches, y'all, 'cause this here's gonna be a boat ride of adventure! 
    Pinkie Pie Eh, I can live with that. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Huh. They just keep coming. 

    Pinkie Pie  Rarity, would you care for some cotton candy? It's freshly spun! 
    Rarity Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply... well, simple. But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise. Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... Try one, then you'll understand. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack Ooh, are those chocolate chip? 
     
     
    Rarity Sorry! Cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago. 

    Twilight Sparkle Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't sound like Rarity. 
    Pinkie Pie Just wait until you hear how much more unlike her she sounds! 
    Spike  
    Pinkie Pie I thought I'd lighten the mood with some super-fun party boat games. But Rarity was a real wet blanket. 

    Pinkie Pie It's piÃ±ata time! Ooh! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity? 
    Rarity  ...Oh. You were serious. Well, that's adorable. 
    Applejack I'll give it a go! 
    Pinkie Pie That's the spirit! Let's get this boat party started! 
     
    Applejack Whoooooa! Heh-heh! Whoa, doggie! 
     
     
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Tug of war? Now we're talking! Whoever wins gets to be captain! 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity  
    Pinkie Pie Or... one of us should just be captain now? 
     
     
    Rarity Oh, don't worry, dear. Luxury cruises never sink. 
    Pinkie Pie What?! 
     

    Pinkie Pie And that's why the boat sinking was all Rarity's fault. 
    Twilight Sparkle That seems... odd. I mean, we trust you, of course. But it's all so... extraordinary? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, it's "extraordinary", all right. But that's exactly what happened! In fact, the only thing I might've gotten wrong was that there were even more porter ponies! But just to be safe, you should talk to Applejack. She'll know exactly how many porter ponies there were! 
    Spike Okay, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, that's easy. We justâ€”  My muffins! 
    Spike  That's it. We've gotta go talk to Applejack. 
    Twilight Sparkle Good idea. She'll straighten this out. 
    Spike I just really, really wanna know how they made it back! But yeah, that'd be great too. 

     
     
    Applejack Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie says it's Rarity's fault, and Rarity says I sank the boat? Well, that's plumb crazy! If you two really wanna know what happened, I'll tell you. Y'all know how Pinkie Pie and Rarity wanted to get out of their "element"? Well, I bought a treasure map to give 'em a rip-roarin' seafarin' adventure! But they had other ideas. 

    Rarity La-la-la! Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat! 
    Pinkie Pie And more fun than you can shake a stick at!  Because I brought a stick! 
    Applejack Alright, mateys, but just y'all wait 'til you see the high seas adventure I've got planned! 
     

    Applejack  Unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure huntin' adventure and more interested in snacks. 
    Rarity Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling! Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... 
    Pinkie Pie Bet you I can fit them all in my mouth! Ahh... 
    Rarity Pinkie, darling, please! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack  
     
     
     
    Applejack U-uh, Rarity, Iâ€” 
    Rarity Well, I never! Hum-ph! 
    Pinkie Pie Me neither! Hum-ph! 

    Twilight Sparkle Do you want to say it, or should I? 
    Spike I'll go. That sure doesn't sound like Rarity or Pinkie Pie! 
    Applejack Oh, it gets a sight worse than that! 

    Pinkie Pie It's P.W.T. â€“ PiÃ±ata Whacking Time! 
    Rarity Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies. Doesn't interest me in the least. 
    Pinkie Pie Meh. Hee-hee! 
    Applejack Huh? 
     
    Applejack Whoooooa! 
     
    Applejack Looks like we need to change course! 
    Rarity Ooh! Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard! 
    Applejack Maybe so, but it's also the only way to find Plunder Cove! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Applejack  And Pinkie Pie was just about as helpful as a weasel in a hen house. 
    Pinkie Pie Captain Pinkie Pie reporting for map duty! 
    Rarity  
     
    Applejack Hold on, everypony! 
     

    Twilight Sparkle Wait, so it was Rarity and Pinkie's fault? 
    Applejack Yup! And maybe if they ever apologized, I'll consider talkin' to them again. 
    Spike If they all blame each other, I don't know how we're gonna get them to talk again. 
    Twilight Sparkle Neither do I, Spike. Neither do I. 

    Twilight Sparkle There's gotta be some way to fix this. If Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep not talking to each other, they could forget what good friends they really are! 
    Spike I just don't get it! All of their stories are so different!  We're never gonna figure out what really happened. 
    Twilight Sparkle Their stories were different, but they also had a lot in common. 
    Spike I guess... They were all on a ship that sank, and... that's about it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not quite. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle A-ha! Not only do I think I know how the boat sank, I have a pretty good idea how to get Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie back together! 

    Spike I hope this plan of yours works. 
    Applejack  Winona brought me your note about a friendship emergency! H-How can I help? 
    Rarity  Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight! What's the emergency? 
    Pinkie Pie It's a good thing it was time for Gummy's bath, or I might not have seen your note about the emergency, Twilight! 
     
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity What's she doing here?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, but I just didn't know how else to get the three of you here together, and there really is a friendship emergency! Yours! 
    Applejack Oh, there's no emergency! I'm just waitin' for an apology. 
    Rarity An apology?! 
    Pinkie Pie What?! Why would you want me to apologize when it was Rarity's fault?! 
    Rarity What are you talking about? Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink! She stranded us in the middle of the ocean! 
    Spike  Will somepony please tell me how you made it back?! 
     

     
    Applejack  
    Rarity  

    Rarity Well... Maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean... 
    Spike Ugh. 
    Applejack Even so, I don't appreciate bein' hornswoggled into comin' back here. 
    Rarity On that, at least, we agree. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know you each have a different perspective on how the boat capsized and blame each other, but if you come on the boat with me I'll show you what really happened. 
    Rarity Well, not that I have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly whose fault it was. 
    Applejack I think we all know which pony's about to be proven right. 
    Pinkie Pie We sure do. 
    Spike Like I said, I sure hope this works. 

    Spike  Whatever you're looking for, I hope you find it soon! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't worry, Spike. I've got it all under control.  While all of your stories seem very different, they all had something in common â€“ cucumber sandwiches. 
     
    Applejack What in the hay does that have to do with anythin'? 
     
    Rarity And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre? 
    Twilight Sparkle You also mentioned the bubbling water. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle And the swell. Cucumber just happens to be the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and bubbles followed by a swell is what happens when they swim up to the shallows from deep water. 
    Applejack So... we attracted a tri-horned whatchamacallit? 
    Rarity With cucumber sandwiches? 
    Pinkie Pie Sounds like a stretch. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello, bunyip, sir! 
     
    Rarity So that's a... 
    Twilight Sparkle A tri-horned bunyip! Who's very sorry he accidentally knocked over your boat. Right? 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wait, the storm had nothing to do with the capsizing? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nope! 
    Rarity All right. Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior! 
    Applejack Me?! How about you and Pinkie Pie? 
    Pinkie Pie Pfftâ€“ What? Who? Me? Noâ€“ 
    Twilight Sparkle I think I can explain that too. Each of you spent so much time trying to come up with the perfect way to get the others out of their element, that you didn't notice your friends were doing the same thing! 
    Applejack Wait a minute. You brought all those games and things for us? 
    Pinkie Pie Of course! I figured the boat trip was the perfect time to do things that were silly and fun! 
    Rarity And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved. 
    Applejack And I just wanted to give you two a high seas adventure, since that'd be somethin' new and different for y'all. 
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity Ohhhh. 
    Rarity That is so sweet. You must have gone through so much trouble. 
    Applejack Well, not half as much trouble as you did makin' all that fancy food, and bringin' all those games! 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess this just teaches us that even long time friends need to work at communication. 
    Pinkie Pie Well, there's something I'd like to communicate to you all right now! You girls are the best friends a pony could ever have! 
    Rarity Oh, let's never fight again! 
    Pinkie Pie You got it! 
    Applejack  Agreed! 
     
    Applejack All right, you big softie! Bring it in! 
     

    Pinkie Pie Come on, bunyip, sir! You got it! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle One thing's for sure, Spike. There's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element. 
    Spike You said it! 

     

Where the Apple Lies

    Applejack Well, that's the last of it, Filthy Rich. 
    Filthy Rich Just Rich, please. And on behalf of Rich's Barnyard Bargains, thanks for another season's shipment of zap apple jam. 
    Applejack Our pleasure. See ya next time. 
     
    Applejack Uh, Apple Bloom, did you pack up the cider into the same crates as the zap apple jam? 
    Apple Bloom Sure did! Now that I'm gettin' older, I wanna prove I can handle more responsibility on the farm. 
    Applejack But the crates aren't marked. You kept track of what went into which crate, right? 
    Apple Bloom Oh. Um... y-yep. I totally kept track of everything. 
    Applejack Good. Because we wouldn't want Filthy Rich to get a shipment of cider when he's supposed to get zap apple jam. You know how Granny feels about sellin' cider anywhere but on the farm. Are you sure he got the right crates? 
    Apple Bloom  Sure I'm sure! Now why don't you and Big Mac head on out to the house and let me finish up here? 
     
    Applejack If you gave Rich the zap apple jam, then what's this here? 
    Apple Bloom Um... extra? 
    Big McIntosh Nnnope. 

     

    Filthy Rich Granny knows I-I wasn't tryin' to make off with a shipment of cider, right? Because I would never do that. 
    Applejack Don't worry. We know exactly whose fault it was. 
     
     
    Applejack Now why in tarnation would you lie to me, Apple Bloom? 
    Apple Bloom I was kinda hopin' I could fix it before anypony found out. 
    Applejack Tellin' lies won't fix anythin'. Trust me. I know. 
    Apple Bloom What could you possibly know about it? You've never told a lie in your whole life! 
    Big McIntosh  
    Granny Smith  
    Apple Bloom What's so funny? 
    Granny Smith Oh-ho, sugarcube.  Your big sister lied so much when she was a filly, the whole family ended up in the hospital. 
    Apple Bloom What?! 
    Big McIntosh  Eeyup! 
    Applejack  You might as well tell her the whole story. Might even do her some good. 
    Granny Smith When Applejack and Big Mac were just a wee bit older than you are now, they both kept a-squabblin' over who would run the farm better. 

    Young Applejack All I'm sayin' is that you may have plenty of brawn, but I'm the one with the ideas on how to run things better around here! 
    Young Big McIntosh  Applejack, Applejack, Applejack, ideas are all well and good, but you can't plow a field with 'em. I don't know how many times I've told you that. 
    Young Applejack Too many! 
    Granny Smith You two horned toads better stop jabberin' and get to workin'! Yeah, they'd better. I need you to go to town. The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, cider season'll be shorter than a dwarf crabapple tree! 
    Young Applejack and Young Big McIntosh  

    Young Big McIntosh It's like I was just tellin' Cousin Braeburn last week. Now there's a pony who knows how to put his back into a problem... 
    Young Applejack  Oh, hey there, Filthy Rich! 
    Filthy Rich Just Rich, please. And I'd you to meet my fiancÃ©e, Spoiled Milk. Honey, this is Applejack and Big Mac, the two hardest workin' ponies at Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Spoiled Milk You work on a farm? How... quaint. 
    Filthy Rich  Oh, now, dear, be nice. Sweet Apple Acres makes zap apple jam. It's one of Dad's best-sellers. 
    Spoiled Milk You mean one of your best-sellers.  My amazing husband-to-be is running the Rich family business now. Did you know that? Well, now you do. 
    Filthy Rich  Don't mind Spoiled Milk. She's just proud of me. Uh, but she's right. I'm in charge of the store now, and I'm just burstin' with ideas I wanna try! 
    Young Applejack Like what? 
    Filthy Rich Well, how 'bout this? Cider season's around the corner. Why not let me sell it for ya? 
    Young Applejack That is an interesting idea. 
    Young Big McIntosh Well, maybe it's interestin', an' maybe it ain't. But it's definitely not a new idea. Granny Smith told us your grandpa, Stinkin' Rich, used to ask her every year if he could sell our cider in your store, and Granny told him every year about the tradition of everypony in Ponyville linin' up out at Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Filthy Rich So start a new tradition. Some day, one o' y'all will take over the farm just like I've taken over the store. I'm guessin' it'll the one with the best ideas. 
    Young Big McIntosh Well, now, as I've said many a time before, ideas are all well an' good, but you can't plow a fieldâ€” 
    Young Applejack Ya know what? How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest? 
    Filthy Rich Oh, hey, now! Perfect!  Come on, honey. I've gotta get everything ready. 
    Young Applejack Hoo-wee! I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait! 

    Young Big McIntosh I just can't believe you'd make a deal with Filthy Rich without even talkin' to Granny! 
    Young Applejack Aw, Granny will love the idea. And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm. You'll see. 
    Granny Smith See what? 
    Young Big McIntosh Applejack here had another one of her "big ideas", and I think we all know my position on ideas. You can'tâ€” 
    Granny Smith and Young Applejack "Can't plow a field with 'em." 
    Young Big McIntosh Ee... right. 
    Granny Smith Big idea, hmmm? 
    Young Applejack Actually, more of an opportunity. Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town. Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now? 
    Granny Smith And what does this here "opportunity" mean for Sweet Apple Acres? 
    Young Applejack Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, heâ€”or, I-I mean, Iâ€”thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts. 
    Granny Smith Oh, is that all? Absolutely not! 
    Young Applejack  

    Young Applejack  But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich? And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell? 
    Granny Smith Your cider and your jam ain't the same thing! Zap apple jam jars preserve the flavor for moons, but cider starts to spoil the second it comes out the press. That is why every cider season, all of Ponyville lines up at Sweet Apple Acres. And first come is first served! Hmph! 
    Young Applejack I get what you're sayin', Granny. But couldn't you make an exception just this once? I sort of promised. 
    Granny Smith Mm, meh-enh. Besides, cider-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to un-promise. 
    Young Applejack  Oh. 

    Young Big McIntosh I hate to say I told you so, Applejack, butâ€” 
    Young Applejack You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'. 
    Young Big McIntosh Well, I've always thought that the most important thing a pony can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who'll listen, so everypony everywhere always knows everythin' they're thinkin', andâ€” 
    Young Applejack And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else. 
    Young Big McIntosh What? 
    Young Applejack Exactly. 

    Filthy Rich Well, if it ain't my new business partner! 
    Young Applejack Uh, about the cider, Rich... 
    Filthy Rich Take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal! 
     
    Filthy Rich Whoo! Ha! Pretty great, huh? 
    Young Applejack The thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any. 
    Filthy Rich What? Well, I did all this work on your say-so! We shook hooves and everything! 
    Young Big McIntosh Well, you see, at Sweet Apple Acres, we've always been about quality, and while your basic jam jar'll keepâ€” 
    Young Applejack Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight. 
    Filthy Rich Gah! Sounds to me like you're tryin' to make excuses! Whenever Granddad dealt with Granny Smith, she kept her word! If you can't do that, then maybe our families should stop doin' business together! Altogether! 
    Young Big McIntosh Now, now, the thing is, Rich, it ain't really up to us. Y'see, Granny'sâ€” 
    Young Applejack Uh, sick! 
    Filthy Rich Wait, Granny's sick? I-I had no idea. 
    Young Big McIntosh Ee... yeah. Nopony did. 
    Young Applejack Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet. Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment. 
    Filthy Rich Oh, my! O-Of course, of course! I am so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do. 
    Young Applejack Much appreciated. But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time. 
    Filthy Rich Mm-hmm. 

    Young Big McIntosh You were supposed to tell Rich the simple truth! But instead, you made things worse with a giant lie! 
    Young Applejack W-W-What was I supposed to do? You heard Rich. If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether. 
    Young Big McIntosh Yeah, but that's only because I... I forgot to ask if we had any oat crumbles for this delicious-lookin' salad, Granny. 
    Granny Smith  
    Young Big McIntosh  That was only because you made promises you couldn't keep! But there's gotta be a better way out of this mess than by makin' up some story about Granny bein' sick! 
    Young Applejack  Well, it worked, didn't it? 
     
    Filthy Rich Sorry to drop by unannounced. We just wanted to come by to wish Granny a speedy recovery. 
    Young Big McIntosh  Look, sis. Our good friend, Mr. Rich and his fiancÃ©e... are here. Oh, and they brought flowers! For Granny! On account o' she's sick! Like you said. Ain't that sweet? 
     
    Young Applejack Uh, excuse me one second! 
     
    Granny Smith Aah! 
     
    Granny Smith Golly, what in tarnation? 
    Young Applejack Oh, I'm sorry, Granny. I-I didn't see ya there. 
    Granny Smith Ya came blastin' in so fast, t'weren't possible to see nothin'! 
    Young Applejack Can you go out to the barn? I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard. 
    Granny Smith Are you outta yer apple-pickin' mind?! It's suppertime, girl! 
    Young Applejack I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark. You go start countin', aâ€”and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay? 
     
    Young Big McIntosh ...so from that moment on, I took to referrin' to myself as Big or Large or... 
    Filthy Rich Oh, Applejack! Your brother was just explainin' why he always wears his yoke. 
    Spoiled Milk Even though we asked him how your grandmare is doing! 
    Young Applejack Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset. And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am. 

    Filthy Rich Oh, dear. Is she doin' that bad? 
    Young Applejack Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now. In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it. Excuse me. 
     
    Granny Smith D'oh! What in the frilly fumidil has gotten into you?! 
    Young Applejack Sorry, Granny. I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster. 
    Granny Smith Well, you're too late. All the sprayers are here. 
    Young Applejack Oh, good. Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again? 
    Granny Smith It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee. 

    Young Big McIntosh ...and others say that's how the trees got to growin' so tall. But to me, it's just how I got my cutie mark! 
    Spoiled Milk But we asked when we could come back to see Granny. 
    Young Applejack Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight! 
    Filthy Rich  I thought only trees got the blight! 
    Young Applejack Yeah, that's usually the case.  Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General. We just got back right before you showed up. 
    Filthy Rich Oh, my. That is terrible! 
    Spoiled Milk Ew! It's not contagious, is it? 
    Young Applejack Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave...  ...just in case. 
    Filthy Rich You're right. We're gonna have to hurry if we wanna get there before visitin' hours are over. 
    Young Applejack That's right. Wait. Get where? 
    Filthy Rich Why, the hospital, of course. I'm sure we'll see you there. 

    Young Big McIntosh Tellin' Filthy Rich that Granny's in the hospital just made everythin' a hundred times worse! What are we supposed to do now? 
    Young Applejack I got it! 

    Granny Smith Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen! 
    Young Applejack I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away! 
    Granny Smith The hospital? Why? Who's sick? 
    Young Big McIntosh You are, apparently. 
    Young Applejack What he means is you're needed at the hospital. 
    Granny Smith Heh. Whatever for? 
    Young Applejack It's the apple blight! It's startin' to infect ponies now! The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith! 
    Granny Smith Well, what in tarnation are we waitin' for? Let's go! 
    Young Big McIntosh  

    Young Applejack  You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back! Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight. 

     
    Young Applejack Oops! I almost forgot! 
     
    Young Big McIntosh Hrk! 
    Young Applejack This is perfect! Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight. 
    Granny Smith  If you say so, dearie. 
    Young Applejack Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation! 
    Granny Smith What in the rotten rhubarb is goin' on here? 

    Young Applejack  Fancy meetin' you two here! 
    Spoiled Milk Well, we told you we were coming. 
    Filthy Rich Well, I'm glad we found you, because I can't seem to find Granny's room or any nurses who've even heard about a pony with apple blight. 
    Young Applejack Granny's room. Sure! Just go down here, take a left, then a right, go down some stairs, up a bunch more stairs, uh, through the cafeteria, left three more times, and then you're there! Easy as Granny's apple pie!  
    Filthy Rich Uh, aren't you comin' with us? 
    Young Applejack Uh, I'll catch up! I gotta find Big Mac! 

    Young Applejack Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go. 
    Granny Smith Where are you two going? 
    Young Applejack Big Mac can't come! He, uh, might be contagious! 
    Young Big McIntosh and Granny Smith Contagious?! 
    Young Applejack All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up. Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off. You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over. 
    Young Big McIntosh This is spinnin' way out of control, Applejack! Now I know you thought sellin' cider in Filthy's store was a good idea, but it ain't worth lyin' to him about Granny bein' sick and needin' to go to the hospital, or fibbin' to Granny about them wantin' her come here to talk about the blight, orâ€” 
    Young Applejack Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once! This ain't about my ideas. If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under! Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help? 
    Young Big McIntosh Why can't you be Granny? You're her size, and this is all your fault in the first place. 
    Young Applejack I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught! 
    Young Big McIntosh  
    Young Applejack Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life! 
    Young Big McIntosh  Eeeeyup. 
    Young Applejack Granny!  Granny! 
    Granny Smith It's about time! What is goin' on around here?! 
    Young Applejack Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here! I'll come get ya! 
     
    Granny Smith  
     
    Filthy Rich  There you are! We've been going in circles looking for Granny's room! 
    Young Applejack Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost. 
     
    Young Applejack What in the dadgumâ€”?! 
    Spoiled Milk What now? 
    Young Applejack Heâ€“ I mean, she was right here! Oh, no. We gotta go! 
     
    Spoiled Milk I-Is that Granny Smith? 
    Filthy Rich Where are they takin' her? 
     
     
    Young Applejack You two, don't lose that gurney!  Granny, what are you doin'? You were supposed to stay there! 
    Granny Smith It was a supply closet! 
    Young Applejack Oh. Uh... Well, okay, come with me, but be quiet! You know, save your voice for the big presentation! 

     
    Young Applejack  
    "Hippocratic Oath" I-I-I'm sorry, but you can't get any closer without a gown and mask. 
    Young Applejack But-but-but-but that's my brother on there! 
    "Hippocratic Oath" Don't worry. This is our best doctor. She'll have your brother back on his hooves in no time. 
    Young Applejack  
    Granny Smith Now apple blight is a serious disease! 
    Masked Pony 2  Did she say... apple blight? 
    Masked Nurse I think she said "gasket mites". 
    Granny Smith And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches. 
    Filthy Rich  Oh, no! Granny! 
    Masked Nurse Did you say..."prune them branches"? 
    Granny Smith Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad? 
     
     
     
    Young Applejack Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'!  Actually... it's a big lie. 
     
     
    Granny Smith Big Mac?! 
    Filthy Rich  Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?! 
    Granny Smith That is a darn good question. 
    Young Applejack  I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it. 
    Filthy Rich So Granny was never sick? 
    Granny Smith And there ain't no apple blighted ponies? 
    Young Big McIntosh Nnnope. 
    Young Applejack Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more. 
    "Hippocratic Oath" So she's not a doctor? 
    Young Applejack Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault. 
    Young Big McIntosh That's... not entirely true. Maybe if I paid more attention to what you had to say instead of talkin' all the time, none o' this would've happened in the first place. I just need to... talk less and listen more. Especially to you. 
    Young Applejack  Thanks, big brother. And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves. 
    Granny Smith Well, that's nice, but I don't know what in blazes you two are talkin' about! I ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon!  And don't you go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me? 
    Filthy Rich  Um, yes, ma'am. 
    Granny Smith Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight? Now, when I was a filly... 

    Apple Bloom I can't believe you told all those lies! 
    Applejack It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest. I hope you learned somethin', too. 
    Apple Bloom I sure did. I learned that nopony starts out perfect and sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes to figure out who you are. 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Apple Bloom But I think the most important thing I learned is who really runs Sweet Apple Acres. 
    Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh Granny! 
    Granny Smith You're darn tootin'! Now everypony quit your lollygaggery and get back to work! Right after we have a glass of cider.

    Rainbow Dash Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends! 
     
    Rainbow Dash I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie! 
    Misty Fly We get it. You have a fun week planned. 
    Spitfire Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy. 
    Rainbow Dash But you love yelling and blowing your whistle. 
    Spitfire Yeah. I do. 
    Rainbow Dash See you gals later! 
     
    Rainbow Dash  
     

    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Rainbow Dash Huh? Oh, the map! 

    Rainbow Dash Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, the good news is we both got called by the map! 
    Rainbow Dash Awesome!  Does that mean there's bad news? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Well, not exactly. 
    Rainbow Dash  I was just there! 

     

     
    Twilight Sparkle Ooh! 
    Rainbow Dash Ahem. 
    Spitfire All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall off? That has only happened once. 
    Angel Wings She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they? 
    Spitfire You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer? 
    Sky Stinger Yes, ma'am. 
    Rest of recruits Yes, ma'am! 
    Spitfire Well, lemme tell you. You don't! 
    Rainbow Dash  I remember when she said that to me. 
    Recruits  
    Angel Wings You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you? 
    Spitfire  Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go! 
     
    Angel Wings Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria. 
    Spitfire Well, isn't that sweet? Now get going on those laps! 
     
    Spitfire Welcome, Princess Twilight.  What are you doing back so soon? 
    Rainbow Dash Official friendship business. 
    Twilight Sparkle Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends? 
    Spitfire Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers. 
    Rainbow Dash  Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though. 
    Twilight Sparkle You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you. 
    Rainbow Dash Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence. 
    Twilight Sparkle But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on. 
    Spitfire Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion. 
    Twilight Sparkle Classroom portion? 
    Spitfire Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe we can help! 
    Rainbow Dash We can? 
    Twilight Sparkle Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems! 
    Rainbow Dash Count us in! 
    Spitfire Great!  
     
    Spitfire You have your work cut out for you. 

    Twilight Sparkle Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting! 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. 
    Rainbow Dash  Good one, Twilight. 

     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Recruits  
    Rainbow Dash Wake up, newbies! Class is in session! 
    Twilight Sparkle Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash. 
    Rainbow Dash But you can call us "T-Sparks" and "The Dashinator"! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash  Just kidding. 
    Twilight Sparkle And we're here to go over basic flying technique. 
    Sky Stinger  
    Rainbow Dash Who said that?! 
    Sky Stinger Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics. 
    Rainbow Dash What's your name? 
    Sky Stinger Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me? 
    Vapor Trail He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds! 
    Rainbow Dash  Huh. That's pretty impressive. 
    Vapor Trail It's amazing. 
    Twilight Sparkle  It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...? 
    Sky Stinger Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her. 
    Rainbow Dash But you'll have to in the solo trials. 
    Vapor Trail There are...  ...solo trials? 
    Rainbow Dash Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation. 
    Sky Stinger  We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours. 
    Rainbow Dash That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer. 
    Sky Stinger I know. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash  Wake up newbies! Class is in session! 

     
    Recruits  
    Twilight Sparkle Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well. 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student! 
    Sky Stinger Hey, Teach! 
    Rainbow Dash Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight. 
    Sky Stinger Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves. 
    Sky Stinger No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, well, that is very... kind of you? 
    Rainbow Dash Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got? 
    Sky Stinger Yes! Prepare to be impressed! 
     
    Sky Stinger By me. 
     
    Sky Stinger Like I said, Vapor still needs work. 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet! 
    Rainbow Dash But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost. 
    Twilight Sparkle I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  Somepony paid attention in class! 
    Rainbow Dash Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome. 
    Twilight Sparkle And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all.  This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do! 

    Rainbow Dash 
    Fix it without telling them. 

    

    Twilight Sparkle 
    Tell them the truth. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle You don't want to tell them? 
    Rainbow Dash Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence! 
    Twilight Sparkle But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too! 
    Sky Stinger Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away. 
    Vapor Trail  You were... great, Sky. 
     
    Spitfire Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job. 
    Sky Stinger We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me. 
    Vapor Trail Oh, I don't think so. You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer! I was voted best sneeze.  
    Sky Stinger You do have a really great sneeze. 
    Vapor Trail Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy.  I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers. 
    Sky Stinger You have to help her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Actually, she's not the oneâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Will do! 

     
    Rainbow Dash Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer. 
    Vapor Trail Uh, me? 
    Twilight Sparkle Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing. 
    Rainbow Dash You've been doing great! 
    Twilight Sparkle  You've been helping Sky! 
    Vapor Trail Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing. 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop. 
    Vapor Trail Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why are you doing this for him? 
    Vapor Trail  It started when we were kids. You have to understand... 

    Vapor Trail  ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine. 
    "Twirly Whirly" Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework? 
    "Steer Straight" Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough! 
    Young Vapor Trail  
    Young Sky Stinger Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see? 
     
     
    Young Sky Stinger  
    Young Vapor Trail Whoa, that was amazing! 
     

    Vapor Trail  Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances. 
    Twilight Sparkle I understand. But now you're both in trouble! 
    Rainbow Dash You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it. 
    Vapor Trail Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt! 
    Twilight Sparkle What about you? 
    Vapor Trail I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend. 
    Rainbow Dash Then we have to find a way to help both of you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starting with telling Sky the truth. 
    Vapor Trail No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot. 
    Rainbow Dash Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sounds like my cup of oats. 
    Vapor Trail But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice. 
    Rainbow Dash We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me. 
    Vapor Trail With you? Really?! You'd do that for me? 
    Rainbow Dash Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast. 

     
     

    Vapor Trail Whooa... Ah! 

     

     

     

     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, you were awesome! 
    Vapor Trail Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up! 
    Rainbow Dash That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself. 
    Sky Stinger Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash! 
    Vapor Trail You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff! 
    Sky Stinger Heh. And the basic stuff.  You're right, I don't need to practice at all. 
    Vapor Trail Um, maybe, Sky, you should... 
    Sky Stinger I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow. 
    Vapor Trail But not if you don't practice...! 
    Sky Stinger Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved. 
    Vapor Trail  
     
    Sky Stinger What did you say? 
    Vapor Trail  Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but... 
    Sky Stinger But what? 
    Vapor Trail I've been... helping you. 
    Sky Stinger  
    Rainbow Dash Gyuh... 
     
    Sky Stinger  How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me? 
    Vapor Trail What? No! Don't you know me at all? 
    Sky Stinger I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony! 
    Vapor Trail  I can't believe you! 
    Sky Stinger I can't believe I was ever your friend! 
     
    Vapor Trail Thanks a lot. 

     
    Rainbow Dash Do you think they're still mad? 
     
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, they're still mad. 
    Twilight Sparkle This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess. 
    Rainbow Dash No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, no. He's lost his confidence. 
    Spitfire Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?! 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it. 
    Spitfire Yes, you will.  
     
    Rainbow Dash  We really messed up, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle I have a plan. 

    Sky Stinger  
    Twilight Sparkle Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here. 
    Sky Stinger Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, you're not. 
    Sky Stinger  Thanks. Good pep talk. 
    Twilight Sparkle I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship! 
    Sky Stinger So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying? 

     
    Rainbow Dash You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material. 
    Vapor Trail Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention. 
    Rainbow Dash But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right? 
    Vapor Trail Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself! 
    Rainbow Dash I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me. 

    Sky Stinger What's she doing here? 
    Rainbow Dash Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you. 
    Twilight Sparkle And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat. 
    Rainbow Dash Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen!  Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me. 
     

     
    Vapor Trail You got this, Sky! 

    Sky Stinger Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it! 
    Vapor Trail Uh-huh! 
     

     
     
     
    Vapor Trail  
     

     
    Sky Stinger Whoo, yeah!  
     

     
    Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Recruits  
    Spitfire Congratulations! You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy! 
     
    Spitfire Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash. 
    Rainbow Dash  Okay, let's not get carried away. 
    Angel Wings Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria. 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, I heard that! 
    Vapor Trail I can't believe we did it! 
    Sky Stinger You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime. 
    Vapor Trail Aw.  And you can be mine. 
     

     
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Phew. It's good to be home. 
    Rainbow Dash  You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejackâ€” 
     
     
    Misty Fly Dash! I've been looking all over for you! Wonderbolt emergency! We got to get back to HQ. 
    Rainbow Dash You've gotta be kidding me! I was just there!  
     
    Twilight Sparkle  

     

To Where and Back Again - Part 1

    Spike  Well, we don't all have magical horns. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been meaning to move these older books to my reference section for a while. Got to keep the new books front and center! Thank you both for your help. 
    Starlight Glimmer Are you kidding? After all you've done for me, this is the least I can do. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, please. I haven't done that much. 
    Starlight Glimmer Nah. You just taught me the value of friendship. Not much at all. 
    Twilight Sparkle I may have offered some guidance, but you are responsible for the pony you've become. I'm proud to call you my student and my friend. Now we just need to get rid of these boxes. Spike, can youâ€”? Spike? 
    Spike What's that? 
    Twilight Sparkle Is it a bird? 
    Starlight Glimmer Is it a parasprite? 
    Spike It's... it's... incoming! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. I usually get letters by dragon. 
    Spike It is the fastest way to get mail! 
    Starlight Glimmer For me? Who'd be sending me a letter? It's... the ponies from my old village. 
    Twilight Sparkle Are they in danger? 
    Spike Are they upset with you? 
    Starlight Glimmer No... It's worse! They've invited me to the annual Sunset Festival! 

     

    Starlight Glimmer  Uh, hey there, everypony. 
    Party Favor Uh... Hey, Starlight. What are you doing here? 
    Starlight Glimmer I-I... I was invited. To the Sunset Festival? 
    Double Diamond Uh, yeah, but we didn't think you'd actually show up. 
    Party Favor You didn't think we really wanted you here, did you? 
     
    Starlight Glimmer But... I... apologized. I thought everything was fine. 
    Double Diamond and Party Favor  
    Village ponies  
    Starlight Glimmer Please...! Stop...! Stop! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer What happened? Is anypony there? Princess Luna? W-What are you doing here? 
    Princess Luna Dreams are my domain, Starlight Glimmer. I am here because you need me to be. 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh. It's only a dream. 
    Princess Luna It may only be a dream, but the feelings in it are real. 
    Starlight Glimmer  Great. So I guess I'm more afraid of going back to the village than I thought. What do I do now? 
    Princess Luna I have been helped time and time again by six very special ponies. They helped me overcome my past. You're fortunate to have them as friends. I suggest you share your concerns with them. I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer  

    Starlight Glimmer ...and Princess Luna said I should tell you all how I was feeling. So... there it is. I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration. 
    Rarity But why, darling? You went back to apologize. They accepted. Everypony has moved on. 
    Starlight Glimmer But have they? They don't really know how much I've changed. Or even worse, maybe I haven't changed as much as I think I have! 
    Rainbow Dash Trust me. You are a totally different pony now. I mean, you were pretty awful. 
    Applejack Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash What? She was! It's a compliment! 
    Fluttershy I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you. 
    Pinkie Pie And getting an invitation to a party and not going?! That's like... I-It's like...! Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad. 
    Applejack Just be honest with them. I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from. 
    Twilight Sparkle I understand how hard this is for you. Maybe if you took a friend along, it might make things easier. Somepony you trust who would look out for you? 

    Starlight Glimmer Thanks so much for doing this, Trixie. When Twilight said I should bring a friend, you were the first pony I thought of. 
    Trixie Great idea, Princess Twilight. Asking me â€“ Starlight's best friend â€“ to help her on this difficult journey really shows how wise a princess you have become. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I was talking about me. 
    Starlight Glimmer The festival lasts a whole week, but I'm sure we won't stay that long. 
    Trixie Oh. I don't know, Starlight. Time really flies when you're spending it with your best friend!  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Main cast  

     
    Trixie There it is! The town where youâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Magically stole everypony's cutie marks, replaced them with equal signs, and forced them all to hide their natural talents? Yes. 
    Trixie I was going to say where you came from, but yours is a more... emotionally traumatic answer. 
    Starlight Glimmer  I just want to... blend in. Be just another pony in the crowd enjoying the Sunset Festival with my friend. 
    Trixie Sounds good to me! And if things get weird for you, just let me know. I've got your flank. 
    Starlight Glimmer Is that a promise? 
    Trixie Not just a promise. A great and powerful promise! 
     
    Trixie  
    Starlight Glimmer Well, I couldn't ask for more than that. If we're gonna do this, let's do it. 

    Double Diamond Oh! Starlight, you came! 
    Starlight Glimmer  
    Party Favor We were worried you wouldn't be able to make it! Are you staying the whole week? We have different events planned each day! 
    Sugar Belle How is it living in a castle? 
    Double Diamond It is so good to see you! 
    Trixie  
    Starlight Glimmer  It's good to see all of you, too. 
    Party Favor You got here just in time. We were having some debate about these banners. Which do you think feels more "sunsetty"? 
    Starlight Glimmer O-Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Heh. Whatever you think is probably best. 
    Double Diamond Uh, well, how about helping us with the routes for the relay races tomorrow? Can you take a look? 
    Starlight Glimmer Oh, I-I shouldn't. You all go ahead. I-I just want to enjoy the festival. 
    Sugar Belle But you will be a judge for the baking competition, right? 
    Double Diamond We had a few questions about the order of the acts for the talent show. 
    Night Glider And the unicorns have a fireworks show planned! We could really use your help! 
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer No!  
     
    Trixie The Great and Powerful Trixie would like to thank you all for being such an amazing audience. Sadly, it is time for us to depart. Good night, fillies and gentlefoals! 
     
     
     

    Starlight Glimmer Ugh! I was horrible when I led that town! I was ready for them to not trust me, but... I wasn't ready for them to put me in charge again! With my past, I should never be in charge of anything! 
    Trixie So you messed up. Big deal.  I know! The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened. 
    Starlight Glimmer I feel like that's almost good advice. 

    Starlight Glimmer Hey, uh, Pinkie Pie! 
    Pinkie Pie Hey...  you! 
    Starlight Glimmer So... you're probably wondering why I'm back so soon. 
    Pinkie Pie Where were you? 
    Starlight Glimmer I... went to my old village? For the festival? 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, sounds fun! How was it? 
    Starlight Glimmer It was kind of a disaster. I came back early because I freaked out! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, sounds awful! Bye! 
    Starlight Glimmer That was... strange. 
    Trixie Isn't she always strange? 
    Starlight Glimmer Yeah, but not like that. Hey! I'm back early. 
    Rarity Ah. Welcome back? 
    Starlight Glimmer Have you two noticed Pinkie acting a little strange? 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie always acts strange. 
    Trixie Told you. 
    Starlight Glimmer Anyway, I wanted to talk to all of you. Things didn't go the way I thought they were going to go at the Sunset Festival. 
    Rarity What happened? 
    Starlight Glimmer I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village. 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Applejack You freaked out and ran away from a festival? Ha! That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day. 
    Rarity  Oh my. Let me guess. The decorations were terrifying! 
    Applejack and Rarity  
    Fluttershy  ...Applejack for friendship business. 
    Rainbow Dash Hello, ponies. We need Rarity and Applejack. Very important friendship business. 
    Trixie I have to say, I'm really not as impressed with your friends as the rest of Equestria is. 
    Starlight Glimmer I need to talk to Twilight! 

     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Twilight? Hello? 
    Spike What do you want? Twilight's very busy! 
    Starlight Glimmer Spike, I really need to speak with her. 
    Spike Make an appointment! She's a princess, after all! 
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer What's wrong with you? Why are you being soâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle Rude? I think a certain dragon didn't get his nap today. 
    Spike Yeah, right. Whatever. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry. He's been acting a little off all day. I think he missed a meal or something. 
    Starlight Glimmer He's not the only one. Everypony's acting a little strange today. 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, it's definitely been one of those days! How are you? 
    Starlight Glimmer Not great, actually. You're probably wondering why I'm back from the village so early. 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't want to bring it up, but yeah, it did seem strange. Did it not go well? 
    Starlight Glimmer The townsponies kept asking me things, like they expected me to be in charge again. But being a leader is the last thing I should ever be. So we left. Very suddenly. In a literal puff of smoke. 
    Twilight Sparkle Wow, you should definitely never go back to that village. 
    Starlight Glimmer What? 
    Twilight Sparkle If you were worried about what they thought of you before, it's probably way worse now. I'd cut my losses. 
    Starlight Glimmer That's... surprising advice, coming from you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Trust me. I'm the Princess of Friendship. You don't need those ponies. You can always make more friends. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Ah! Speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, important business to attend to! 
     

    Starlight Glimmer Cut my losses? That can't be right. 

     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Hey, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. Party Favor, can you hear me? 
    Twilight Sparkle I told you you can never speak to them again! 
    Starlight Glimmer What are you all doing here? 
    Twilight Sparkle Making sure you do what I said! I'm your teacher, aren't I? Didn't I say to never come back here?! 
    Starlight Glimmer Yes, but that just doesn't seem right. You aren't acting like yourself. 
    Starlight Glimmer and Princess Luna Something is wrong! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer A dream? This is another dream! 
    Princess Luna  Starlight Glimmer...! 
    Starlight Glimmer Princess Luna? 
    Princess Luna Starlight Glimmer! 
    Starlight Glimmer Princess Luna, where are you? 
    Princess Luna Starlight Glimmer, there is no time! You must get help! 
    Starlight Glimmer What? What are you talking about? This is just a dream! 
    Princess Luna Not here! In the waking world! They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! Your dream called to me, and I was able to break through! You must find help! 
    Starlight Glimmer What are you saying?! Who's taken you?! 
    Princess Luna Be careful who you trust! You need all the help you can find! The changelings have returned andâ€”  
    Starlight Glimmer Princess Luna! 

    Starlight Glimmer  They're back! 

     
     
    Starlight Glimmer Trixie? Trixie, it's Starlight! Are you awake? 
    Trixie  Of course, Princess Celestia... I'd love to perform for peanut butter crackers... 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Trixie, wake up! 
     
    Trixie  Starlight? What time is it? 
    Starlight Glimmer It's late. I think I figured out what's wrong with my friends! 
    Trixie  I have a whole list of things that are wrong with your friends. We can go over it in the morning. 
    Starlight Glimmer No, Trixie, we're in danger! 
     
    Trixie  Okay, fine! Aside from lack of sleep, how are we in danger? 
    Starlight Glimmer I think theâ€”!  What did you tell me never to tell another pony? 
    Trixie Starlight, if you woke me up to play guessing gamesâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer After we left my village, what did you tell me to never tell another pony you said? 
    Trixie  That even Trixie's made mistakes. 
    Starlight Glimmer Trixie, there's no time for this! What did you say? 
    Trixie That even Trixie's made mistakes! Okay? Are you happy?! 
    Starlight Glimmer  one of them! 
    Trixie  One of who? 
    Starlight Glimmer A changeling! I think they've taken Princess Celestia and Princess Luna! 
    Trixie What?! Are you sure?! I mean, what do weâ€”? We have to tell Twilight! 
    Starlight Glimmer If I'm right, then it's too late for that. 

    Main cast  
     
    Spike  
     
    Spike  
    Rarity  
    Twilight Sparkle Is it ready? 
    Applejack Just one more. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Queen Chrysalis! 
    Queen Chrysalis Ugh. I can't take any of you seriously when you look like that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, right. 
     
    Queen Chrysalis Much better. Now report! 
    Changeling Everything here is going according to plan! We've replaced the six ponies and their dragon, and have taken control of the castle! 
    Queen Chrysalis Excellent. And I've just received word that the princesses from Canterlot have successfully been replaced as well. 
    Changelings  
    Queen Chrysalis We thought too small last time. One ponynapped princess wasn't enough. With all the most beloved ponies of Equestria taken care of, nopony can stop us!  
    Changelings  
     
    Changelings  
     
     
    Changeling Twilight  
    Trixie  
     

     
    Trixie  I can't deal with this! I'm just a performer! This is... This is princess-level stuff! But the changelings have all the princesses... We're doomed! 
    Starlight Glimmer Maybe not. Uh, Queen Chrysalis only said they took Luna and Celestia and obviously Twilight and the others... but maybe Cadance is still safe. Our best bet is to get to the Crystal Empire before the changelings do. That way we canâ€” 
    Thorax There's no help coming from the Crystal Empire. 
    Trixie  
    Starlight Glimmer Thorax? 
    Thorax Yes. 
    Starlight Glimmer Your wings look... different. 
    Thorax I guess they do. 
    Starlight Glimmer How do I know you aren't some other changeling pretending to be Thorax? 
    Thorax You were there when Spike defended me to the ponies of the Crystal Empire. Princess Twilight saidâ€” 
     
    Thorax As the Princess of Friendship, I should set an example for all of Equestria. But today it was Spike who taught meâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer Okay, okay. I believe you. We don't need the whole speech. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Trixie, this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling. He's on our side. Understand? 
     
    Thorax Hi. It's a pleasure to... 
    Trixie If Starlight says you're on our side, I believe her. But maybe just stay over there for now, okay? 
    Starlight Glimmer What did you mean there's no help? Did the changelings get Cadance too? 
    Thorax They took Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart! Sunburst sent me here to get Princess Twilight's help, but... but it sounds like it's too late for that, too! So... what should we do? 
    Trixie Yeah, Starlight. What are we gonna do? 
    Starlight Glimmer I... I don't know! There has to be somepony else who can handle this? 
    Trixie There is nopony else! Everypony with powerful magic is already gone! 
    Discord You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls? 
    Starlight Glimmer First, how do we know that you're really you? 
    Discord  
     
     
    Discord Shall I continue? 
    Starlight Glimmer Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria! Celestia, Luna, Cadance, Shining Armor, Flurry Heart, Twilight and her friends. We need toâ€” 
     
    Discord  They took Fluttershy? 
    Starlight Glimmer Yes! 
    Discord  Where? 
    Starlight Glimmer The Changeling Kingdom. With you on our side, I canâ€” 
    Discord  
     

     
    Discord Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy. 
     
    Trixie  I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be... 
    Thorax I'd hoped never to see that place again. Now what? 

     
     

To Where and Back Again - Part 2

     

    Starlight Glimmer It's... the ponies from my old village. 

    Village ponies  

    Starlight Glimmer Oh. It's only a dream. 

    Starlight Glimmer With my past, I should never be in charge of anything! 

    Princess Luna They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! 

    Starlight Glimmer Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria! 

    Starlight Glimmer ...this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling. 

    Discord  They took Fluttershy? 

    Trixie  I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be... 

     

    Discord Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here. 
    Thorax Oh, I-I can probably explainâ€” 
    Discord Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed... 
    Starlight Glimmer Maybe we should come up with a plan first? 
    Discord  A what? 
    Trixie You know, figuring out the best way to do something before you actually do it. 
    Discord  Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything. 
    Thorax Uh, actuallyâ€” 
    Discord That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need? 
    Trixie A draconequus with magic and half a brain might help. 
    Discord Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something. 
    Thorax The thing about magic here isâ€” 
    Discord Like this!  
    Pigasus  
    Thorax I've been trying to tell you! Nothing other than changeling magic works here. Chrysalis' throne is carved from an ancient dark stone that soaks up outside magic the same way changelings soak up love. It's how she keeps the hive safe. 
     
    Trixie  So, uh, what kind of plan were you thinking? 
    Starlight Glimmer Without magic, I have no idea. But nopony else is coming. So somepony better come up with something. 
     
    Starlight Glimmer Anypony? Anything? Hmm. This throne â€“ if we get into the hive and destroy it, can we get our magic back? 
    Thorax Uh-huh! 
    Discord Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive? 
    Trixie We walk. 
    Discord I haven't walked that far in a millennia! 
    Starlight Glimmer and Trixie  

    Discord Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want! 
    Trixie Well, I, for one, definitely miss you being able to disappear! 
    Starlight Glimmer Give Discord a break. None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic. 
    Thorax I did. 
    Starlight Glimmer If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are. 
    Discord Oh! Like a secret code! How about if I say "we are" and you say "doomed"? Or you say "rescue" and I say...  
    Trixie How about if we say "klutzy" and you say "draconequus"? 
    Starlight Glimmer "Klutzy draconequus". Works for me. 
    Thorax I'll definitely remember it. 

    Trixie Okay. I am definitely glad you came. I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you. 
    Thorax You definitely wouldn't. 
     
    Trixie Um, where's the way out? 
    Thorax It's a changeling hive. It shifts and changes like we do, and we're the only ones who can navigate it. It's total chaos to non-changelings. 
    Discord Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it "total". 

    Discord Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy? 
    Starlight Glimmer If Thorax is right, then yes. 
    Discord  Well, that's reassuring. 
    Trixie And how are we supposed to destroy the throne when we find it? 
    Starlight Glimmer I... don't know. 
    Trixie  That's reassuring. 
     
    Discord I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props. 
    Trixie Asks the Lord of Chaos who can't go for a walk without whining nonstop! 
    Discord Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist! 
    Trixie Self-absorbed?! Why, you...! 
    Starlight Glimmer Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals! 
    Discord  Okay. 
    Trixie How can we help? 
    Starlight Glimmer Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I had magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going. 
    Thorax Um, guys? I think we're lost. 
    Trixie Oh, great. We might as well just sit here and wait for the changelings to soak up all of our love or whatever gross thing it is that they do. How often do you all get hungry? 
    Thorax Actually, I haven't been since I met Spike. And changelings are always hungry. We can never get enough love. 
    Trixie Well, that's just superâ€” 
    Starlight Glimmer But you aren't hungry at all now? 
    Thorax Huh. Once I made a few friends, I guess I just sort of forgot about the whole feeding thing. 
    Starlight Glimmer Is that about the same time your wings changed? 
    Thorax I guess so. 
    Discord  
     
    Trixie  Can you please lower your voice?! You're gonna get us all captured! 
    Discord Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive. 
     
    Trixie W-What's that? 
    Thorax A changeling patrol! 
     
    Thorax  
    Discord This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan. 
    Trixie What kind of plan?! We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are gonna save us! 
    Starlight Glimmer Do you have any of your smoke bombs? 
    Trixie Are you kidding? 

     
    Thorax Looking for somepony? 
     
    Thorax Is that the best you've got?!  
     
    Discord Not exactly great and powerful, but effective. 
    Trixie Hm. I'll take it. 
    Starlight Glimmer "Klutzy"... 
    Trixie and Thorax ..."draconequus"! 
     
    Discord Ugh. I really think we need a new code word! 
    Thorax That was a pretty good plan. 
    Trixie But we still don't know where we're going. 
    Starlight Glimmer Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest. 
    Thorax Oh! With an intruder in the hive, they went to protect the queen! Good thinking, Starlight! 
    Starlight Glimmer  

     
    Trixie Now what? 
    Starlight Glimmer We... go in. 
    Thorax Even if I wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure. 
    Starlight Glimmer We need some kind of... distraction. 
    Trixie I'm fresh out of smoke bombs. 
    Discord Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic... 
    Starlight Glimmer You shouldn't underestimate yourself. 

     
    Discord  Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you. 
     
     
    Discord  But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug! 
     
    Discord "To bug"? Is this thing on?  
     
    Discord Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest! 
     
     
    Trixie It is absolutely ridiculous that that worked. 

     
    Discord It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy  
    Discord Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Discord! I'm stuck! 
    Discord You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho... 
    Fluttershy But what? 
    Discord But you are obviously not Fluttershy! 
    Fluttershy Oh. 
    Discord I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away. 
    Fluttershy  I understand! 
    Discord Oh, come on! 
    Fluttershys  
    Fluttershy #1 We're probably all changelings. You shouldn't rescue any of us. Unless, you think, maybe one of us might be the real Fluttershy. Oh, that certainly would be a nasty changeling trick, wouldn't it? 
    Fluttershys  
    Fluttershy #2 I'm the real one. 
    Fluttershy #3 I'm the real one. 
    Fluttershy #4 I'm the real Fluttershy. 

    Thorax We can't wait for Discord. Between seeing him and Trixie, the castle will be crawling with guards soon. 
    Starlight Glimmer But if we do manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to. 
    Trixie He's probably already been captured! 
    Changeling Hello? Fellow rescuers? 
    Thorax We can't stay here. We gotta find the throne. 
    Changeling Ooh! I heard some of the changelings who were chasing me say that they know where it is! 
    Trixie "Klutzy"...? 
    Changeling Hmm? Oh. Yeah.  I-I can be klutzy. Now, follow me. 
    Starlight Glimmer  You know that's not Discord, right? 
    Trixie Obviously. 
    Changeling This way! We're almost there! 
    Thorax I know this trick. If he says to go left, we should definitely go right. He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack! 
    Trixie  Okay, I'll handle it. You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel. 
    Starlight Glimmer Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, Iâ€” 
    Trixie Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend. Hey, Discord! Want to see the new trick I've been working on? I call it the "Changeling Catcher"! Run! 
     
     
     
    Trixie  Ta-da... 
     

    Starlight Glimmer and Thorax  
     

     
    Queen Chrysalis  Oh, how will I ever prevent this daring rescue? 
     

     
    Queen Chrysalis Well, well, well. The Princess of Friendship's sole pupil. Honestly, I didn't think you were worth replacing with one of my drones. 
    Thorax  You won't get away with this! 
    Queen Chrysalis I already have. Nopony is coming to save you. Your little squad was it. And now, there's just you. 
    Thorax Thorax is still out there. 
    Queen Chrysalis Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom! He was a fool to leave and even more a fool to return! When I find him, he'll learn just what happens to those who betray the hive! 
    Thorax  
    Queen Chrysalis And it seems I don't have far to look, do I... 
    Thorax  
     
    Queen Chrysalis Thorax? 
     
     
    Starlight Glimmer  
     
    Queen Chrysalis Very clever. And clearly Thorax revealed to you the secret of my throne. I can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me. Even with your rather embarrassing little rescue attempt, everything has gone according to my plan. 
    Starlight Glimmer What plan? Why did you do all this?! 
    Queen Chrysalis So I could feed, of course! By replacing the most beloved figures in Equestria, my drones will be able to store all the love meant for them and return it here to me. Everypony will do as I command, and my subjects and I will feed on their love for generations!  
     
    Starlight Glimmer What if you didn't have to? 
    Queen Chrysalis Ridiculous! The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied! 
    Starlight Glimmer Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time! 
    Queen Chrysalis You know nothing of the changelings or what it takes to be their queen! I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub! 
    Starlight Glimmer I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way! 
    Queen Chrysalis The only thing Thorax has found is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer No! Stop! 
    Queen Chrysalis Just as soon as I drain every last ounce of love from him and show my subjects what a real leader is! 
    Thorax  I can feel the love inside me slipping away...! I can't hold onto it much longer...! 
    Starlight Glimmer Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it! 
     
    Starlight Glimmer This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it! 
     
     
     
    Discord Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy It's, um, good to see you, too. 
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight? What happened? 
    Starlight Glimmer We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now. 
    Princess Luna Well done, Starlight Glimmer. It seems as though you've learned a great deal since we last spoke. 
     
    Queen Chrysalis  
     
    Starlight Glimmer When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve. 
     
     
    Queen Chrysalis There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to what I will exact upon you one day, Starlight Glimmer! 
    Princess Celestia Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings. 
    Discord Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?! 
    Fluttershy Oh! Uh, everypony? 
    Starlight Glimmer Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option. 

    Party Favor Uh, hey, Starlight. What are you doing here? 
    Double Diamond You left in such a hurry before, we kinda thought you didn't wanna come. 
    Starlight Glimmer Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay. 
    Double Diamond  Are you kidding? Of course! 
    Starlight Glimmer Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake! 
    Discord So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again. 
    Trixie Yeah, yeah. And I'm still a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist, right? 
    Discord Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know. 
    Trixie Ha! When pigs fly! 
    Discord Your wish is my command!  
    Pigasus  
    Trixie Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! 
    Rainbow Dash Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed. 

     

Celestial Advice

     
    Spike Twilight, are you reading during a party... again? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle No no no! She's already good at that! She mastered this! She taught me about this one! 
    Spike Wild guess something's wrong. 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike, I'm a terrible mentor! Why didn't I come up with a path for Starlight? Princess Celestia had it all figured out for me!  
    Spike Whoa! 

    Twilight Sparkle I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up! I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore. 
    Princess Celestia So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar. 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle That's why I had to talk to you . You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me. 
    Spike Huh? 
    Princess Celestia Heh. Go on. 
    Twilight Sparkle When I was your student, and you were in this place, youâ€” Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away! 

     
     
     
    Discord I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.  You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Gee, thanks, Discord. 
    Discord Any time. I really love being helpful. 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle If I could have everypony's attention. As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out, that's just not meant to be. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day! 
     
    Pinkie Pie  What a great surprise! 
    Twilight Sparkle  The future's in your own hooves now. 
    Starlight Glimmer Wow. I was not expecting this! 
    Trixie and Thorax Mmm...  
    Discord Darn it. I was hoping you'd send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down. 
    Trixie How do you wanna celebrate? Girls' trip to Las Pegasus? 
    Thorax We could throw you a changeling gourd fest! Uh, it's more fun than it sounds. 

    Princess Celestia It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could. 
    Twilight Sparkle My cheeks are sore. I don't think I've ever smiled this much in my life. 

My Little Pony Equestria Girls

     
    Applejack Hoo-wee! Your very first princess summit. You must be over the moon, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I am excited. But, to be honest, I'm a little nervous, too. 
    Pinkie Pie You're 'nervicited'! It's like you wanna jump up and down and yell "YAY ME!!" But you also wanna curl up in a teeny-tiny ball and hide at the same time! We've all been there! 
    Fluttershy I'm there almost every day. 
    Applejack You've got no reason to fret, Twi. Everything's gonna be justâ€“ 
    Rarity TWILIGHT! Oh, sorry, darling, but I just realized you're not wearing your crown. You haven't forgotten it back in Ponyville, have you? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's in my bag. Just feel a little self-conscious about wearing it. Haven't really gotten accustomed to these yet, either. 
    Rarity You are a princess now, Twilight. Embrace it! I'm telling you, if I had a crown like that, I would never take it off. Why, I'd sleep in the thing. 

     
    Flash Sentry Her highness, Princess Twilight Sparkle! 
    Princess Cadance  Twilight! I haven't seen you since the coronation! 
    Princess Celestia We have so much to discuss. But it can wait until tomorrow. You all look tired from your journey. Now, off to bed, all of you. 
     

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike What's wrong, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know, Spike. I'm just... worried, I guess. Princess Cadance was given the Crystal Empire to rule over. What if, now that I'm a princess, Celestia expects me to lead a kingdom of my own? 
    Spike That would be awesome! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, it would not! Just because I have this crown and these wings, it doesn't mean I'll be a good leader! 
    Spike Aw, sure ya will, Twilight. Now c'mon, you should get some shut-eye. Big day tomorrow!  
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Twilight Sparkle Just trying to get comfortable! Ugh! 

     

     
     
     
    Spike  
    Sunset Shimmer Ugh! 
    Spike Huh? What? 
    Twilight Sparkle  My crown! She's got my crown! Stop! Thief! She's stolen my crown! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle Stop!  
     
    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle What did you do with my crown? 
    Sunset Shimmer Sorry it had to be this way... Princess. 
    Main cast  
    Fluttershy Who was that? 

    Princess Celestia Sunset Shimmer. A former student of mine. She began her studies with me not long before Twilight. But when she did not get what she wanted as quickly as she liked, she turned cruel and dishonest. I tried to help her, but she eventually decided to abandon her studies and pursue her own path. One that has sadly led to her stealing your crown. 
    Spike She replaced Twilight's with this one. 
    Princess Celestia I suppose Sunset Shimmer thought you wouldn't notice right away that this was not yours. And by the time you did, it would be too late to go after your crown and Element of Harmony. 
    Twilight Sparkle But I don't understand. Where did she go? Why did she take the crown? 
    Princess Celestia You'll soon know more about this place than even I do. 

    Princess Luna This is no ordinary mirror. It is a gateway to another world. A gateway that opens once every thirty moons. 
    Pinkie Pie Sparkly! 
    Princess Luna It has always been kept in the throne room of Canterlot Castle. But when Princess Cadance took over the Crystal Empire, we sent it here for her to watch over. 
    Princess Celestia  I had always hoped that Sunset Shimmer would someday use it to return, to come back to Equestria seeking my guidance. Obviously, this is not what has happened. 
    Princess Cadance Twilight, you must use the mirror to go into this other world and retrieve your crown. Without it, the other Elements of Harmony have no power and Equestria is left without one of its most important means of defense. 
    Princess Luna Your crown does not belong in the place Sunset Shimmer now calls home. And in her possession, your Element of Harmony will no doubt be used to bring harm to the inhabitants of this other realm. They will not have the power to defend themselves. 
    Princess Celestia You understand the importance of your task? 
    Twilight Sparkle Of course. 
    Princess Celestia Good. Then you must go at once. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash Whoa, whoa, whoa! She's going, we're going with her. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Right, girls? 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh! I'm so 'nervicited'! 
    Applejack You do realize that's not a real word, right? 
    Princess Celestia I'm afraid I can't let you go. 
    Rainbow Dash What?! Why not?! 
    Princess Celestia Sending all of you could upset the balance of this alternate world, creating havoc that would make it impossible for Twilight to get the crown back from Sunset Shimmer. This is something Princess Twilight must do alone. 
    Princess Luna Time is of the essence. On the third day, when the moon reaches its peak in the night sky, the gateway will close. And once it does, it will be another thirty moons before you will be able to use it to return. 
    Rest of main cast  Spike, NO! 
    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! Aaaah! 
    Spike  

    Twilight Sparkle  
    Spike Uh, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? Spike! You're not supposed toâ€“ Spike? Are you a... dog? 
    Spike I... think so. But I have no idea what you are! 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh?  
    Spike Twilight, you have to get it together! 
    Twilight Sparkle  What... does the rest of me look like? 
    Spike Um, like you. Only not you. Your muzzle's really small. 
    Twilight Sparkle My muzzle?!  
    Spike Are you gonna scream again? Where are we? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know. But that must serve as the gateway back to Equestria. We need to find my crown as soon as possible and get back there. I suggest we start searching the castle first. 
    Spike Works for me. Yeah, I don't think that's how the new you is supposed toâ€“ 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Whooaaa... Whoa! Ooh...  C'mon, Spike. I do not wanna be like this for longer than I have to. 
    Spike Well, look on the bright side. You don't have those pesky wings to worry about anymore. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm!  My magic! It isn't working! 
    Spike Makes sense. You don't exactly have your horn. 
    Twilight Sparkle What?! 
    Spike We really need to find you a mirror. 

    Twilight Sparkle What do ya think, Spike? Other artifacts she's stolen from Equestria?  What am I? 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? Oof! 
    Flash Sentry Whoa. You okay? 
    Spike I don't think this is a castle. 

    

        I've never seen a place 
        That's quite like this 
        Everything is turned around 
        This crazy world is upside-down 

        Getting on my feet 
        It's the hand that I was dealt 
        But I don't have much time with them 
        Got to learn all that I can 

        They don't use any magic or fly with any wings 
        I don't get these funny clothes, skinny legs or tiny nose 
        Everything's confusing when it seems so new 
        But I look a little closer and it starts to feel familiar too 

        What a strange new world (what a strange new world) 
        I'm trying to make heads or tails of this strange new world (what a strange new world) 
        Sorting through the small details of this strange new world 

        What a strange new world 

    Fluttershy Oh, I'm really sorry. I-I just found it, and-and I thought I should give it to her. I didn't know you had dropped it. 
    Sunset Shimmer Well, I did! And I was about to get it before you swooped in and ruined everything! You shouldn't pick up things that don't belong to you. 
    Fluttershy  It... doesn't really belong to you, either. 
    Sunset Shimmer Excuse me?! 
    Fluttershy N-n-nothing... 
    Sunset Shimmer That's what I thought. It's as good as mine, and you know it. You really are pathetic. It's no wonder your best friends are all stray animals. 
    Twilight Sparkle How dare you speak to her that way! 
    Sunset Shimmer What did you say? 
    Twilight Sparkle I said, "How dare you speak to her that way!" 
    Sunset Shimmer You must be new here. I can speak to anyone any way I want. 
     
    Fluttershy I can't believe you did that! 
    Twilight Sparkle I couldn't just stand there. 
    Fluttershy Well, it's just that nobody ever stands up to Sunset Shimmer. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sunset Shimmer!? 
    Fluttershy You've heard of her? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sort of... 
    Fluttershy I don't think I've seen you around before. Did you just transfer to Canterlot High from another school? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um... yes! Another... heh, school! My name's Twilight. 
    Fluttershy  I'm... Fluttershy. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sorry, what was that? 
    Fluttershy  It's Fluttershy! 
    Twilight Sparkle It sounds like you're saying Fluttershy, but how can that...? 
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness! Who's this sweet little guy? 
    Twilight Sparkle That's Spike! My, uh... dog! 
    Fluttershy Oh, he's so cute! Go on, eat up, little pup! 
    Spike  Huh? 
    Fluttershy Oh, wouldn't ya just give anything to know what they're really thinking? 
    Twilight Sparkle He usually just tells me. 
    Fluttershy Oh, w-what do you mean? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, uh, nothing! (chuckles) Never mind. Sunset Shimmer said you picked something up. Something that belonged to her. It wasn't a crown, was it? 
    Fluttershy How did you know? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, lucky guess? Do you still have it? 
    Fluttershy Mm-mm. 
    Twilight Sparkle But you know what happened to it. 
    Fluttershy Mm-hmm. This morning, I was passing out flyers for the animal shelter like I do every Wednesday. 

    Fluttershy Canterlot's animal shelter needs more volunteers. Won't you help an animal that can't help itself? 
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Fluttershy Ow! 

    Fluttershy I have no idea how it got there. But I didn't want anything to happen to it, so I decided to give it to Principal Celestia. 
    Twilight Sparkle Principal Celestia? She's the ruler here? 
    Fluttershy You could say that. Technically, I guess she and Vice Principal Luna do make the rules. 
    Twilight Sparkle Where is she now? 
    Fluttershy Probably in her office. Third door on your left. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you! 
    Fluttershy Oh, wait! You're not really supposed to have pets on school grounds. Might wanna tuck him into your backpack. That's what I do. 
     
     
    Fluttershy They just get so lonely when I'm in school all day. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, okay! Thank you! 
     
    Fluttershy Oh, no! I'm late for class! 

     
    Principal Celestia Come in. How may I help you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, uh... Whew. My name's Twilight Sparkle. I-I'm new here, and... Well, I understand that Fluttershy found a crown this morning and gave it to you. 
    Principal Celestia Yes. I've had Vice Principal Luna put it somewhere for safekeeping. No idea how it ended up in the front lawn. Were you interested in running for Princess of the Fall Formal this year? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, no. Not exactly. The truth is... Well, the truth is I... You see, the crown is actually... Princess of the Fall Formal? 
    Principal Celestia It's Canterlot High's big Fall dance. 
    Twilight Sparkle Like the Grand Galloping Gala. 
    Principal Celestia Uh, Grand Galloping Gala? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, uh, it was a big deal at my old school. 
    Principal Celestia And was there a princess? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but she wasn't exactly a student. 
    Principal Celestia Here at Canterlot High, the students select one of their peers to represent them. She receives a crown at the Fall Formal. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm. You asked me if I was interested in running for Princess. Can anyone run? 
    Principal Celestia Yes. You just need to let the head of the Fall Formal planning committee know you'd like to be on the ballot. Was there anything else? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, nope! That was it! 
    Principal Celestia Well, if you do need anything else, my door is always open. 
     
    Spike Twilight, why didn't ya just tell her the crown was yours and ask for it back? 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I was going to, but imagine if one of them showed up in Equestria saying they came from a place filled with tall, fleshy, two-legged creatures with these? We'd think they were crazy! 
    Spike Hmm. You make a good point. 
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like if I want my crown back, I'll have to become Princess of the Canterlot High Fall Formal. So that's what I'm gonna do! 
    Spike And how exactly do you plan on doing that? 
    Twilight Sparkle I have no idea! 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle I know we've just met, but I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something. 
    Fluttershy Of course! 
    Twilight Sparkle I've decided to run for Princess of the Fall Formal, andâ€“ 
    Fluttershy  Oh! Oh, gosh! Sorry. It's just, oh, running for Fall Formal Princess is a really bad idea. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why? 
    Fluttershy Sunset Shimmer wants to be Fall Formal Princess, and when she wants something, she gets it! She'll make life awful for anyone who stands in her way. Just ask the girl who ran against her for Princess of the Spring Fling. 
    Twilight Sparkle I have to try! 
    Fluttershy Oh, I don't think you understand. You'd have to convince everyone here to vote for you instead of her the athletes, the fashionistas, the dramas, the eco-kids, the techies, the rockers... 
    Twilight Sparkle Why is everyponyâ€“ 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, everybody separated this way? 
    Fluttershy Maybe it was different at your old school, but at C.H.S., everybody sticks to their own kind. One thing that they do have in common is that they know Sunset Shimmer is gonna rule the school until we graduate. 
    Twilight Sparkle Not if I can help it!  where would I find the head of the party planning committee? 

    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy said she'd probably be in here. 
    Pinkie Pie Incoming!  
    Twilight Sparkle Hi, my name's Twilight Sparkle and... Pinkie Pie? 
     
    Pinkie Pie  Are you psychic?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, no. I don't think so. Unless of course that's something you can do here. 
    Pinkie Pie  Not usually. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy said this is where I'd find the head of the Fall Formal planning committee. 
    Pinkie Pie Fluttershy, huh? Don't let the whole "shy" thing fool you. She can be a real meanie. 
    Twilight Sparkle You two aren't friends? 
    Pinkie Pie Waited a bit to get your name on the ballot, huh? Dance is day after tomorrow. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm brand new here. 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh! I thought you didn't look familiar. Though, now that I'm really lookin' at you... Do you have a twin sister who lives in the city, has a pet dog named Spike that looks just like that one? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, maybe? 
    Pinkie Pie Thought so. Anyhoo, just need to fill this out and you are officially up for the coveted Princess of the Fall Formal crown. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Wow! You have really bad handwriting. It's like you've never held a pen before. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Is it? 
    Applejack Somebody order a dozen cases of fizzy apple cider? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh! Oh! Me, me-me-me, me, yeah, ha-ha, me! 
    Applejack Can you bring in the rest? 
    Big McIntosh Eeyup. 
    Applejack Hey, I know you. 
    Twilight Sparkle You do? 
    Applejack Sure. You're the new girl who gave Sunset Shimmer the what for today.  
    Pinkie Pie Twilight Sparkle here is gonna run against Sunset Shimmer for Princess of the Fall Formal. 
    Applejack  But then, here comes the backstabbin'. 
     
    Applejack About the only girl in this school you can trust less than Sunset Shimmer is Rainbow Dash. 
    Twilight Sparkle Rainbow Dash? 
    Pinkie Pie She's the captain of, like, every team at Canterlot High. 
     
    Applejack She's also the captain of sayin' she's gonna do somethin' for ya, and then turnin' around and not even botherin' to show up. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks for the advice, Applejack, but this is something I really need to do. 
    Applejack Huh, suit yourself. Hey, how'd you know my name is Applejack? 
    Twilight Sparkle Um, I uh...  Didn't you say? 
    Big Mac Nnnope. 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, it sure was nice meeting you both. I'm sure I'll be seeing you around. 
    Pinkie Pie That one's tryin' to hide a secret, but I am totally on to her.  She's psychic! 
    Applejack Uh-huh. If you say so. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer This looks terrible! There should be more streamers near the stage and fewer balloons. 
     
    Snips Yeah, streamers! 
    Snails And fewer balloons! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Fizzy apple cider? Ugh! This is my coronation, not a hoedown. 
    Applejack Well, now, it ain't necessarily gonna be your coronation this time around. 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, is that so? You country folk really aren't that bright. Must be why the other students say such awful things about you. 
    Applejack Grrr... 
    Sunset Shimmer Obviously it's gonna be my coronation. I'm running unopposed. 
    Pinkie Pie Not this time. The new girl just signed up! 
    Sunset Shimmer What?! 
    Pinkie Pie I know. Her handwriting is really bad. 
    Sunset Shimmer  I'm looking forward to meeting the competition! 

     
    Sunset Shimmer Can't believe I didn't recognize you earlier. Shoulda known Princess Celestia would send her prized pupil here after my crown, and her little dog, too. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's my crown! 
    Sunset Shimmer Whatever. This is just a minor setback for me. You don't know the first thing about this place, and I already rule it. 
    Twilight Sparkle If that's so, why do you even need my crown? You went to an awful lot of trouble to switch it with the one that belongs here. 
    Sunset Shimmer Pop quiz what happens when you bring an Element of Harmony into an alternate world? You don't know? Seriously?  And you're supposed to be Princess Celestia's star student? Then again, what were the chances she'd find somepony as bright as me to take under her wing after I decided to leave Equestria? Bit embarrassing that you were the best she could do. 
    Spike  
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, and I'd keep an eye on your mutt. Hate for him to be... taken away from you. 
    Spike Is that a threat? 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, of course not. 
    Spike  
    Sunset Shimmer But I'd cut down on the chatter if I were you. Don't want everyone to know you don't belong here, now would you? You wanna be a princess here? Please. You don't know the first thing about fitting in. 

    Sunset Shimmer I want you to follow her. Bring me something I can use just like I did with that last girl who thought she could challenge me. 
    Snips You got it, Sunset Shimmer. 
    Sunset Shimmer When the crown and its power are mine, Twilight Sparkle will be sorry she ever set hoof into this world. Not that she would've been much safer if she'd stayed in Equestria. 
    Snips Yeah, in Equestria. 
    Sunset Shimmer What are you still doing here?! Go! 
    Snips and Snails Ow. Oh. 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Trixie Lulamoon Excuse me. The Great and Powerful Trixie! ...Needs some peanut butter crackers. 
     
    Trixie Lulamoon VoilÃ ! 
    Twilight Sparkle Sunset Shimmer is right. I don't know the first thing about this place. If I'm gonna really fit in and win votes, we need to do some research. 
    Spike Research? 
    Twilight Sparkle This place has a school. I have to believe it's got a... library! 
    Snips Got your phone? 
    Snails Got yours? 
    Snips and Snails  
    Twilight Sparkle So I just push the letters here, and then the words and moving pictures will come up here? 
    Cheerilee  That's right. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe this place does have magic. 
     
    Scootaloo  "When you're a youngerâ€“" 
     
    Cheerilee Uh, girls, what are you doing? 
    Sweetie Belle We're just seeing how many hits our new music video has gotten. 
    Scootaloo  "So the three of us will fight the fight..." 
    Cheerilee  No, just... 
    Scootaloo  "There is nothingâ€“" 
     
    Cheerilee No! The school computers are for research purposes only. 
    Apple Bloom It's just as well, y'all. Some of the comments about our song were really awful. "Epic fail"... "Funniest thing I've ever seen"?! 
    Sweetie Belle Funniest thing they've ever seen, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, I don't know that that's what you should take from...  
    Snips and Snails  

    Twilight Sparkle Whoa! Whoa! Waah! 
    Cheerilee Shhh! 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh...  
    Snips and Snails  
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. 

    Twilight Sparkle  

    Voice on P.A. system The library will be closing in five minutes. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I hadn't even thought about where we're gonna sleep tonight! 
    Spike Way ahead of you. 

    Spike It's a little  dusty. But it doesn't seem like anybody comes up here. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's perfect, Spike. 
    Spike So, how did your research go? 
    Twilight Sparkle I found this book. It's called a yearbook. It seems to be something they use to keep a record of things that have happened at the school. Look. That's Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, and I'm gonna bet the girl on the far right is Rarity. 
    Spike There's a Rarity here!? Uh, I mean, uh... interesting photo. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's interesting because they look like they're friends. 
    Spike They do look like our friends. But I thought we'd figured that out already. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, I mean... they look like they're friends with each other. But it doesn't seem like they're friends now. 
    Spike Not so much. 
    Twilight Sparkle I just can't help but get the feeling that Sunset Shimmer had something to do with it. 
    Spike I wouldn't put it past her. But she wanted your crown 'cause she's planning on doing something even worse! If you're gonna stop her, you have to focus on making friends here. Can't worry about why these girls aren't friends anymore. Even if they  do remind you of your Ponyville friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle You're right, Spike.  Eye on the prize. 

    Principal Celestia  Good morning, students, and happy Thursday. Just a reminder to pick up your ballots for the Princess of the Fall Formal today. They are due at the time the dance starts tomorrow night, so don't forget to turn them in and make your voice heard. 
    Twilight Sparkle Fluttershy said I'd need to win over all those different groups if I wanna become Princess of the Fall Formal. So I've compiled a list of talking points. 
    Spike  Uh... Please... Continue. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'll start introducing myself, sprinkle in some things I learned about their world into the conversation, show them how I fit in here!  Okay, Spike. Time to make a good first impression on my fellow students. The whole world sorta depends on it. 
    "Nolan North" Hey, look. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle Why is everybody looking at me funny? Whoa! What're you...? Why did you...? Rarity? 
    Rarity Perfect! Oh, yes. This is good! No one will recognize you! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why wouldn't I wanna beâ€“ 
    Rarity And we'll need a disguise for your dog, which is too bad. He really is so adorable! Y'know, with a little work, I think I could make him look like a rabbit instead. 
    Spike Huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle A rabbit? 
     
    Applejack There you are, Twilight. 
    Rarity So much for the disguise. 
    Applejack I've been lookin' all over for ya! 
    Fluttershy Me too. 
    Pinkie Pie Me three! I like your new look! 
    Rarity I do have an eye for these sorts of things. Not that you seem to care. 
    Pinkie Pie What?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Why do you think she doesn't care? No, never mind. Why were you all looking for me? What's going on? 
    Fluttershy Oh, she hasn't seen it yet. 
    Twilight Sparkle Seen what? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, it's really not that bad.  
    Sunset Shimmer  Twilight Sparkle wants to be your Fall Formal Princess. But what does it say about our school if we give someone like this... such an important honor? 
    Twilight Sparkle Wha... I... 
    Pinkie Pie I take that back. It's pretty bad! 
    Twilight Sparkle But this all happened yesterday! At the library! Has everyone in the school seen this? Is that why they were all looking at me that way? 
    Pinkie Pie and Applejack Mmm... 
    Twilight Sparkle What am I gonna do? No one is gonna vote for me after seeing this! 
    Fluttershy Not that it'll make any difference, but I'll still vote for you. 
     
    Fluttershy You were so nice to stand up for me when Sunset Shimmer was picking on me yesterday. 
    Pinkie Pie If ya still wanna run, maybe there's something I can do to help! 
    Fluttershy Word of advice? Don't accept her help. She doesn't take anything seriously! 
    Pinkie Pie Ugh! Why do you have to be so awful to me? 
    Rarity Oh! Pff. Kch. Ts! Don't play innocent, Pinkie Pie! You are no better than she is! 
    Pinkie Pie And what is that supposed to mean?! 
    Rarity  To someone who would appreciate what I have to offer! 
     
    Applejack Listen to y'all carryin' on! Get over it and move on! 
    Rarity You mean like how you've gotten over what happened with Rainbow Dash? 
    Applejack She said she'd get the softball team to make an appearance at my bake sale. I tell everybody they're comin', and then not one of 'em shows up! She made a liar outta me! That's different! 
    Pinkie Pie and Rarity Is not! 
    Applejack Is too! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle STOP! All of you! I wanna show you something. You were friends once. 
    Applejack Hmm. The Freshman Fair. Y'all remember? 
    Pinkie Pie Mm-hmm. 
    Rarity Yes. 
    Twilight Sparkle But something happened. I think that something was Sunset Shimmer. 
    Rarity Well, it's a nice theory, darling, but Sunset Shimmer had nothing to do with it. 
    Fluttershy She's right. Sunset Shimmer isn't the one who ruined my silent auction for the animal shelter by bringing fireworks and noisemakers! It was supposed to be a serious event, and Pinkie Pie ruined it! 
    Pinkie Pie What are you talking about? I got a text from you saying that you didn't want a silent auction. You wanted a big party! 
    Fluttershy Uh! I never sent you a text! 
    Pinkie Pie You didn't? 
    Rarity You don't think she's the one who's been sending me those e-mails, do you? Every time I volunteer to help with the decorations at a school function, I get an e-mail from Pinkie Pie saying she has plenty of volunteers! And then I find out she's done everything herself. 
    Pinkie Pie I never sent you any e-mails! 
    Applejack Maybe she's the reason Rainbow Dash didn't show up for my bake sale! 
    Twilight Sparkle Didn't you ever ask Rainbow Dash why she didn't show up? 
    Applejack Heh, I guess I kinda stopped talkin' to her at all after that. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe now would be a good time to start. 

    Rarity They're actually talking! That's a good sign! 
    Pinkie Pie Hugs! Ooh, hugs are always good! 
    Applejack Somebody, and I think we can all guess who, told Rainbow Dash that my bake sale had been moved to a different day. Dash showed up with all the softball team and thought I'd cancelled on her! 
    Rainbow Dash So you're lookin' to dethrone Sunset Shimmer and become Princess of the Fall Formal, huh? Gotta say, I'd really love to see that happen. I'll totally help you out! All you gotta do is beat me in a game of one-on-one. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Rainbow Dash First to five goals wins. One-zip! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rainbow Dash That's game! 
    Rarity I... really thought you were gonna... pull it off there in the end!  
    Rainbow Dash So what's the plan? How can I help you be princess instead of Sunset Shimmer? 
    Twilight Sparkle But... I... lost! 
    Rainbow Dash Of course you lost. I'm awesome! But I'm not gonna help just anybody try and beat Sunset Shimmer. The Fall Formal Princess should be someone with heart and determination. You've proved that you've got 'em both! 
     
    Snips and Snails  

    Twilight Sparkle And... can I get mine with extra oats? 
    Mrs. Cake Oats? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, scratch that. However you normally make it is fine. 
     
    Flash Sentry Oh! We've got to stop bumping into each other like this. 
    Twilight Sparkle You know me! Always trying to make a big splash around here. 'Cause my drink kinda splashed... on the ground!  I'm gonna go over there now. 
    Rarity Don't even think about it! You're already trying to get her crown. Who knows what Sunset Shimmer would do if you ended up getting her ex-boyfriend too? 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not trying to. I don't even know... We just accidentally... Ex-boyfriend? 
    Fluttershy Flash Sentry broke up with her a few weeks ago. I can't believe she hasn't done something awful to him yet. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe she's just waiting until she has the power to do something really awful. 
    Applejack All right, girls. Dance is tomorrow night, and we still don't know how we're gonna get Twilight the votes she needs to be named princess. Right now, folks only know the Twilight from the videos Sunset Shimmer posted online. We need to help 'em see her differently. 
     
    Rarity I'VE GOT IT! Ahem. I mean, um, perhaps I have a solution. Now this may be an absolutely preposterous idea, but what if we all wore these as a sign of unity? Freshman year, they were very, very popular. A way for everybody to show their school spirit! You know? "Go, Canterlot Wondercolts!" Ahem. I haven't sold any in ages. I mean, the five of us are obviously very different, but deep down, we're all Canterlot Wondercolts! Sunset Shimmer is the one who divided us, Twilight Sparkle is the one who united us. And we're gonna let everyone know it! What do you think? 

     
     
     
     
     

    

        Hey, hey, everybody 
        We've got something to say 
        We may seem as different 
        As the night is from day 
        But you look a little deeper 
        And you will see 
        That I'm just like you 
        And you're just like me. 
        Yeah! 

        Hey, hey, everybody 
        We're here to shout 
        That the magic of friendship 
        Is what it's all about 
        Yeah, 
        We thought we were different 
        As the night is from the day 
        Until Twilight Sparkle 
        Helped us see another way 

        So get up get down 
        If you're gonna come around 
        We can work together 
        Helping Twilight win the crown 
        So get up get down 
        'Cause it's gonna make a sound 
        If we work together 
        Helping Twilight Sparkle 
        Win the crown! 

    

        Hey, hey hands up now, 
        We're sending a message 
        To the crowd 
        Hands wave up 
        Then come down 
        We party together 
        All around 

    

        Generous, honesty, 

    

        Laughter, kindness, loyalty 

    

        Twilight helped us each to see 

    

        All that we can be! 

    

        So get up get down 
        If you're gonna come around 
        We can work together 
        Helping Twilight win the crown 
        So get up get down 
        'Cause it's gonna make a sound 
        If we work together 
        Helping Twilight Sparkle 
        Win the crown! 

    

        I'm gonna be myself 
        No matter what I do 
        And if we're different yeah 
        I want you to be true to you 

        If you follow me 
        We'll put our differences aside 
        We'll stick together and 
        Start working on that school pride! 

    

        Jump up make a sound (Hey!) 
        Stomp your hooves turn around 
        Start now, make a change, 
        Gonna come around 
        Jump up make a sound (Hey!)

        Stomp your hooves turn around 
        Canterlot... 

     
    Sunset Shimmer Take those off! I have something I need you to do. 

     
     
    Rarity Doesn't everyone look just fabulous? 
    Twilight Sparkle It was a great idea, Rarity! 
    Applejack Don't know what she's smilin' about. Twilight's the one that's gonna be Princess of the Fall Formal. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Vice Principal Luna! Something terrible has happened! 

    Sunset Shimmer Isn't this just awful? And after Pinkie Pie worked so hard to make things so perfect! Why would Twilight Sparkle do something like this? 
    Vice Principal Luna Why would you think Twilight was responsible for something like this? 
    Sunset Shimmer Because I have proof. 

    Twilight Sparkle But... But I don't understand! 
    Vice Principal Luna This is clearly you in the photographs, is it not? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but... 
    Vice Principal Luna I think it should be fairly obvious that the school cannot let someone who would do something like this compete for the Fall Formal crown. 
     
    Flash Sentry Vice Principal Luna. I found these in a trash can in the library. Thought you should see them. Someone obviously combined these photos to make it look like Twilight was the one who trashed the gym. 
    Vice Principal Luna I appreciate you bringing these to my attention, Flash. In light of this new evidence, you may of course continue your bid to be crowned the Princess of the Fall Formal. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thank you! You have no idea how important this is to me! 
    Flash Sentry (chuckles) What was I gonna do? Not prove your innocence? Wouldn't be much of a Canterlot Wondercolt, would I? 
    Vice Principal Luna I am afraid enough damage has been done to the gym that we will have to postpone the dance until tomorrow night. If you will excuse me, I need to let my sister know about this latest development. 
    Flash Sentry So, uh, I was wondering. If you aren't already going with somebody, wanna go to the Fall Formal with me tomorrow night? 
    Twilight Sparkle That would be... Tomorrow night!? No, no-no-no-no-no, no no no no no! Nonononono! I can't! The portal! That'll be too late!  
    Flash Sentry One "no" would have been fine! 

    Rarity Everything okay in there? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes!  Only it's not okay. It's not okay at all! If I don't get my crown tonight, I won't be able to go back to Equestria for another thirty moons! Oh, what are we gonna do? 
    Spike Hmm. We tell them the truth. Let them know what's really at stake if you don't get the crown tonight. They'll help us figure somethin' out. 
    Twilight Sparkle But what if they won't? What if when they find out how different I really am...? 
    Spike Twilight, these girls rallied around you 'cause they saw what was in your heart. They aren't gonna feel any differently about you when they find out you're a pony princess in Equestria. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm glad you followed me here, Spike. 
    Spike Me too. Unless, of course, we get stuck here for another thirty moons. 
    Applejack You okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle The Fall Formal isn't happening tonight. 
    Pinkie Pie WHAT!? 
    Twilight Sparkle It had to be postponed because Sunset Shimmer had Snips and Snails ruin all of Pinkie Pie's decorations. 
    Pinkie Pie WHAT?!? 
    Twilight Sparkle But the Fall Formal has to happen tonight. 
    Pinkie Pie Whaâ€“! 
    Twilight Sparkle  You see... 
    Pinkie Pie You're from an alternate world and you're a pony princess there and the crown actually has a magical element embedded in it that helps power up other magical elements, and without it they don't work anymore, and you need them all to help protect your magical world, and if you don't get the crown tonight, you'll be stuck in this world and you won't be able to get back for, like, a really, really long time!  
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, I'm pretty sure that isn't the reason. 
    Spike Nope, she's pretty much spot-on. 
    Rarity He can talk!? 
    Spike Oh, yeah! And back where I come from, I'm not even a dog! I'm a ferocious, fire-breathing dragon! 
    Fluttershy This is so amazing! Tell me, what are you thinking right now? 
    Spike Sure would love a scratch behind the old ears! 
    Rarity Gah... 
    Spike Uh, maybe later. 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you know all that? 
    Pinkie Pie Just a hunch. 
    Applejack Wait a minute! Lemme get this straight. You're a pony? 
    Rarity You're a princess? 
    Fluttershy You're from another world? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Mm-hmm. 
    Rainbow Dash That... is... awesome! 
     
    Spike See? Told ya. 

    Rarity I simply cannot believe they did all this! 
    Pinkie Pie If I only had some kind of... party cannon that could decorate everything super fast! 
    Twilight Sparkle I know it seems impossible, but, maybe if we all work together? 
    Applejack Now that's the kinda can-do spirit I'm lookin' for in a Fall Formal Princess! Let's do it, y'all! 
    Rarity Absolutely! 
    Rainbow Dash Rock on! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes, indeedily! 
    Fluttershy  Yaaay! 

    

        It's time for us to come together 
        It's the only way that things will get better 
        It's time for us to take a stand 
        So come on and lend a helping hand 

    

        Fix it up 
        Yeah, it's all right 
        We'll get it ready by tonight 

        Mix it up 
        Yeah, help a friend 
        We'll come together in the end 

    

        It's time to show that we've got school spirit 
        Raise your voice and let everyone hear it 

    

        It's time to show that we're strong 
        So come on, everybody, sing along 

    

        (Look...) Look how we've all come together 
        (Things...) Things are only just starting to get better 
        (Look...) Look how we've all come together 
        (Things...) Things are only gonna get better, better, better, better! 

        (We... will...) Fix it up, yeah, it's all right 
        (Come... tonight, tonight...) We'll get it ready by tonight 
        (We... will...) Mix it up, yeah, help a friend 
        (Come... together, together...) We'll come together in the end 
        (We... will...) Fix it up, yeah, it's all right 
        (Come... tonight, tonight...) We'll get it ready by tonight 
        (We... will...) Mix it up, yeah, help a friend 
        (Come... together, together...) We'll come together, together now! 

    Pinkie Pie This... looks... sooooo... GOOD! 
    Principal Celestia  All right, everyone! Fall Formal is back on for this evening. 
     
    Principal Celestia So you'd better get out of here and start getting ready. Oh, and don't forget to cast your ballots for the Fall Formal Princess on your way out! 
    "Scott Green" You got my vote, Twilight. 
    "Cloudy Kicks" Mine, too! 
    Girl #2 Mine too! 
    Girl #3 Mine too! 
    Sunset Shimmer You're lucky she was able to pull this off. Next time I ask you to make a mess of things, try to show a little restraint! I need this Formal to go on tonight just as much as she does. 

    Fluttershy I still can't believe we pulled that off! 
    Rainbow Dash I can! We're awesome! 
    Rarity Enough chatter, girls. We need to get ready, and we need to look fabulous! 

    

        This is our big night 
        We're getting ready 
        And we're doing it up right 

        This is our big night 
        Friendship survived, 
        Now we'll start it out right 

        The time's right, gonna make it last 'cause it's the first night 
        That we're ever gonna start to just have fun together 
        We're so glad, so happy we could never be mad 
        Did it right now, this is our big night now 

        Six friends on the way up now 
        Six friends here to show you how 

        This is our big night 
        We're getting ready 
        And we're doing it up right 

        This is our big night 
        We made it happen 
        Now let's party all night 

        This is our big night 
        This is our big night 
        This is our big night 
        This is our big night 

     
     
     
    Flash Sentry Uh, Twilight! Look, I know you said "no" about going to the Fall Formal with me, but would you reconsider and at least have one dance? 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't say "no"! I mean, I did, but... I didn't mean no, to you. I was... Well, what I mean is... yes. I'd love to dance with you! 
     

     
    Twilight Sparkle Anybody see Sunset Shimmer? 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe she was too embarrassed to show! She's gotta know you won by a landslide! 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe... 
     
     
    Principal Celestia First off, I wanna say how wonderful everything looks tonight. You all did a magnificent job pulling things together after the unfortunate events of earlier. And now, without further ado, I'd like to announce the winner of this year's Fall Formal crown. The Princess of this year's Fall Formal is... Twilight Sparkle! 
     
    Principal Celestia Congratulations, Twilight. 
    Spike Twilight! Help! 
    Twilight Sparkle Spike? 
    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle They've got Spike! 

    Sunset Shimmer That's close enough! 
    Spike Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't hurt him! 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, I wouldn't dream of it. I'm not a monster, Twilight.  You don't belong here. Give me the crown, and you can go back to Equestria tonight. Or keep it and never go home. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Sunset Shimmer Tick-tock, Twilight. We haven't got all night. The portal will be closing on its own in less than an hour. So, what's your answer? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. 
    Sunset Shimmer What!? Equestria! Your friends! Lost to you forever! Don't you see what I'm about to do to the portal?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Yes, but I've also seen what you've been able to do here without magic. Equestria will find a way to survive without my Element of Harmony. This place might not, if I allow it to fall into your hands. So go ahead. Destroy the portal. You are not getting this crown! 
    Sunset Shimmer Fine. You win. 
    Rainbow Dash You... are... so awesome! 
    Applejack I can't believe you were gonna do that for us! 
    Rarity It's no wonder you're a real live princess! 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, yes, she's so very special!  Grab him, you fools! 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Spike! Spike! Fluttershy! 
    Sunset Shimmer I'll take that!  At last! More power than I could ever imagine! 
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer  
    Main cast  
    Snips This is gonna be so cool! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer I've had to jump through so many hoops tonight just to get my hands on this crown, and it really should have been mine all along.  But let's let bygones be bygones. I am your princess now, and you will be loyal... to me! 
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer  Spoiler alert I was bluffing when I said I was going to destroy the portal. I don't want to rule this pathetic little high school; I want Equestria! And with my own little teenage army behind me, I am going to get it! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle No, you're not! 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh, please! What exactly do you think you're going to do to stop me? I have magic, and you have nothing! 
    Rainbow Dash She has us! 
    Sunset Shimmer  What!? 
    Twilight Sparkle The magic contained in my Element was able to unite with those that helped create it!  Honesty! Kindness! Laughter! Generosity! Loyalty! Magic! Together with a crown, they create a power beyond anything you could imagine, but it is a power you don't have the ability to control! The crown may be upon your head, Sunset Shimmer, but you cannot wield it, because you do not possess the most powerful magic of all the magic of friendship! 
    Sunset Shimmer No!  What is happening?! 
    Twilight Sparkle Here and in Equestria, it is the only magic that can truly unite us all! 

    Twilight Sparkle You will never rule in Equestria. Any power you may have had in this world is gone. Tonight, you've shown everyone who you really are. You've shown them what is in your heart. 
    Sunset Shimmer  I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know there was another way. 
    Twilight Sparkle The magic of friendship doesn't just exist in Equestria. It's everywhere. You can seek it out, or you can forever be alone. The choice is yours. 
    Sunset Shimmer But... But all I've ever done since being here is drive everyone apart. I don't know the first thing about friendship. 
    Twilight Sparkle I bet they can teach you. 
    Spike Those are my girls! Woo-hoo! 
    "Brawly Beats" Did that dog just talk? Whoa. Weird. 
    Spike Seriously? The talking dog is a weird thing about all this? 
    Rarity I, for one, think you're adorable. 
    Spike Oh, yeah. 
    Principal Celestia I believe this belongs to you. A true princess in any world leads not by forcing others to bow before her, but by inspiring others to stand with her. We have all seen that you are capable of just that. I hope you see it too, Princess Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle I do. 
     
    Flash Sentry Would now be a completely awkward time to ask you for that dance? 
    Twilight Sparkle  

    

        This is our big night 
        We made it happen 
        Now let's party all night 

        We're here now and we worked so hard to make it come around 
        To tonight so let's try to make it last forever 
        The school lights so bright, beat is pumping through the night 
        Party's starting, DJ's got the music just right! 

        Six friends on the way up now 
        Six friends here to show you how 

        This is our big night 
        This is our big night 
        This is our big night 

    Main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle You'll look out for her, won't you? 
    Rarity Of course we will. Although I do expect some sort of apology for last spring's debacle. 
    Twilight Sparkle I have a feeling she'll be handing out a lot of apologies. 
    Spike We better get going. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know we've only been friends for a short time, but I'm gonna miss all of you so much.  
    Spike That crown really does suit you, Princess Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle You know what, Spike? I am starting to feel a little more comfortable wearing it. 
    Spike And the wings? 
    Twilight Sparkle I've been walking on two legs and picking things up with these! Wings? I'm thrilled that's all I'll be dealing with back in Equestria! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Oh, bummer! 

    Fluttershy Twilight! 
    Rainbow Dash Ah, you're back! 
    Rarity You've got your crown! 
    Pinkie Pie I knew you could do it! 
    Applejack Oh, we were so worried. 
    Princess Celestia Sunset Shimmer, is she alright? 
    Twilight Sparkle I think she's gonna be fine. I left her in good hands. 
    Rainbow Dash What are hands? 

    Fluttershy Where did you stay? 
    Rarity What did they wear? 
    Pinkie Pie Did ya have fun? 
    Applejack What'd ya eat? 
    Rainbow Dash Would ya say she's just as awesome as me? 
    Twilight Sparkle  I wanna tell you all everything, I do, but I'm just so exhausted from all the dancing. 
    Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Princess Cadance Dancing?! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Flash Sentry Oh. 
    Flash Sentry We've got to stop bumping into each other like this. 
    Twilight Sparkle Who was that? 
    Princess Cadance He's a new member of the castle guard. Flash Sentry, I think. Why? Do you know him? 
    Twilight Sparkle Not exactly. 
    Applejack Oooh! Somepony's got a crush on the new guy! 
    Twilight Sparkle No. No, I don't. 
    Rarity  She does! She absolutely does! 
    Twilight Sparkle Don't be ridiculous. I don't even know him. He just... 
    Pinkie Pie Totally reminds you of a guy you met in the other world who played guitar, was in a band, and helped prove you didn't destroy all the decorations for a big dance, so you could still run for princess of the big dance, and then asked you to dance at that dance?!  Right? 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you know that? 
    Pinkie Pie Just a hunch! 

     

    

        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 

        I couldn't see what was 
        Right there in front of me 
        Turned my back 
        Got my mind off track 
        Yeah 
        You saw a world that was 
        Something new entirely 
        Helped me to see 
        All the possibilities 

        Oooohhhhh.... 
        Like a star in the day light 
        Or like a diamond at night 
        Your light was hidden 
        From my sight 

        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 

        Every friendship is tested 
        You say you're sincere 
        But it's all unclear now 
        But with a word 
        Everything changes 
        And just like that 
        You and I are right back 

        Oohhh.... 
        Like a star in the day light (Star in the day light) 
        Or like a diamond at night (Diamond at night) 
        Your light will shine 
        When the time is right 

        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 

        When I put my hand out 
        And I thought I would fall 
        You knew what I needed 
        And you came around 
        To fix it all 

        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        Ooohh-wa-ooohh 
        (Like a star in the day light) 
        A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh) 
        (Like a diamond at night) 

        Ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohhh 
        That's what you are to me

Music to My EarsEdit

     
     
    Mrs. Cake What can I get ya? 
     
     
     
     

Guitar CenteredEdit

    Rarity Rainbow Dash, I simply don't understand why you can't just play the guitar you have. 
     
    Rarity  Now I understand. 
    Pinkie Pie How about this one? 
    Rainbow Dash No. 
    Pinkie Pie Lookie here! 
    Rainbow Dash No. 
    Pinkie Pie Super groovy! 
    Rainbow Dash No, Pinkie. 
    Applejack Well, whatcha looking for? 
    Rainbow Dash That's the problem! I need something that looks as awesome as I'm gonna make it sound.  Hands off my guitar, Trixie! 
    Trixie Lulamoon I touched it first, Rainbow Dash! 
    Applejack Sounds to me like this is a makin' for a nice, friendly competition. 
    Rainbow Dash All right! Let's see who plays best! 
    Trixie Lulamoon A shred-off? 
    Rainbow Dash Shred on. 
     
    Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash Check me out! Uh, she can have it. Turns out this is the one that really speaks to me. 
    Trixie Lulamoon The Great and Powerful Trixie always wins in the end!  
    Rainbow Dash I doubt it. 
    Trixie Lulamoon Twelve-thousand dollars?! You'll pay for this, Rainbow Dash! 
    Pinkie Pie No, silly! If you want it, you have to pay for it. 

Hamstocalypse NowEdit

     
    Fluttershy Thanks for coming, Rarity. The rescue center needs all the help it can get. 
    Rarity Oh, but of course, darling. Helping cute little puppies and kitties will never go out of style. 
    Fluttershy Once a year, a lucky volunteer gets to clean the hamster habitat. I signed up for it months ago to be sure I'd get it.  Housecleaning! 
    Rarity Ooh. Uh, Fluttershy, darling, aren't hamsters, uh, rodents? 
    Fluttershy They sure are. But they're cute and cuddly like bunnies. Okay, everyhamster, follow Rarity into the next room. She'll take good care of you while I give your home a nice scrub. 
     
     
    Fluttershy Rarity, what happened?! 
    Rarity Oh! Aah! Well, uh, Carl Pettington's coat just begged to be accessorized, but Emilia Furhart refused to be left out and got Curtis Pawpower to chew right through Carl's little scarf, and before I knew it, I had a habitat-wide feud on my hands!  Also, I named them. 
    Fluttershy Ladies and gentlehamsters, please! Now, I know you're all upset, but why don't we head back into the habitat and talk it over? 
    Carl Pettington  
    Emilia Furhart  
    Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Curtis Pawpower  
     
     
    Rarity Huh! I never would have guessed hamsters could be so touchy about fashion! 

Pinkie on the OneEdit

    Granny Smith Just remember, the most important thing about sugar butter cocoa cookies is to fold your batter. Too much arm turnin'll make your cookies tougher than a lump of coal. 
    Rainbow Dash Come on, Pinkie. You're s'posed to help me find a drummer for my band. 
    Pinkie Pie I guess I could fold a little faster. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Most people don't know how hard it is to find someone who could use both hands the way a drummer does. 
    Pinkie Pie I'll bet! 
     
    Granny Smith Uh... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash  

    Rainbow Dash Now, it's important that our banner look awesome! So feel free to use as much glitter as you want. A drummer can't just be anybody. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, of course not.  
    Rainbow Dash They need to have the right instincts, you know? 
    Pinkie Pie Totally!  
    Rainbow Dash  

    Rainbow Dash It's gotta be someone with a lot of... 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash ...energy. 
    Pinkie Pie Absolutely!  
    Rainbow Dash I mean, a lot! Energy, enthusiasm... 
     
    Applejack Pinkie! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash They have to be able to carry the whole band on their shoulders! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Pinkie! 
    Rarity We've got to find an outlet for all that energy! 

    Pinkie Pie  
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack Whoa! 
    Rainbow Dash Cool! 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Rarity Whatever made you think of Pinkie for the drums? 
    Rainbow Dash I dunno. Guess I just have a sense for these things. 
    Pinkie Pie  

Player PianoEdit

    Rarity  Oh, boys! 

    Rarity I simply cannot thank you enough. And while I am a bit repulsed by your musky smell, I can appreciate that you're all diamonds in the rough. 
     
    Rarity Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me! Thank you! 
    Rover, Fido, and Spot  

    Pinkie Pie  
    Rainbow Dash Ugh! Where is Rarity?! 
    Applejack That gal probably just wants to make some sort of grand entrance. 
    Rarity Tada! 
    Applejack Told ya. 
    Rainbow Dash Rarity, couldn't you have chosen a more portable instrument? 
    Rarity Heavens, no! The grand piano is the most refined and elegant of instruments. With it, I will be able to express my full musicality. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Well, our time's up. I guess we'll have to move our practice to the gym. 
    Applejack Guess you're gonna express your "full musicality" clear across campus. 
    Rarity Huh? Awww... 
    Pinkie Pie Or you could play this! It's part guitar, part keyboard! It's a guitarkey! 
    Rainbow Dash You mean a keytar. 
    Pinkie Pie Po-tay-to, to-mah-to. 
    Rarity  Ooh! Oooh! Oh, my! 
    Applejack Well, look at that! 
    Rainbow Dash Cool! 
    Pinkie Pie  Wowee! 
    Fluttershy Oh, my goodness! 
    Applejack Well, then, how about ya take that keytar and move your tail to our next rehearsal space? 
    Rarity Fine, fine.  

A Case for the BassEdit

    Applejack Okay, Granny, one more time. When ya accidentally sold my bass at the garage sale, who did ya sell it to? 
    Granny Smith  I sold it to the owners of that new pawn shop. Uh, Flibbity Flabbity, somethin' like that. 

     
    Flim Welcome to the grand opening of the Flim Flam Brothers' Everything Under the Sun Emporium! 
    Flam If you want it... 
    Flim and Flam ...we've got it! 
    Flim Need a pogo stick? 
    Flam A bowling ball? 
    Flim A stuffed clown? 
    Flam Whatever this is? 
    Applejack I'd like that bass. 
    Flim I can give you this bass for a non-negotiable price of one thousand dollars. 
    Rarity Why, you only paid Granny Smith two dollars for it! 
    Flim Yes, well, we have to cover our overhead and transportation costs. 
    Applejack Listen, Granny never should've sold my bass. I'll give ya the two dollars back and we'll call it even. 
    Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Flim and Flam Likely story! 
    Applejack It is. That's my bass. 
    Flim And can you prove that this is, in fact, your bass? 
    Rarity Her initials are monogrammed right on the strap. 
    Flam That could mean anything. It could stand for... 
    Flim "Aardvark Junior"... 
    Flam "Anvil Jokers"... 
    Flim Or "Animal Jane". 
    Flam Why, I'll bet you don't even play the bass, Applejack -- if that is your real name. 
    Rainbow Dash Of course that's her real name! 
    Pinkie Pie And she does play the bass! 
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity  
    Flim Perhaps this is her bass. But there are still the transportation costs and overhead. 
    Flam Don't forget the stocking fees. 
    Flim Wouldn't dream of it, brother! 
    Applejack  
    Flam Then again, I suppose we could make some sort of trade? 

    Applejack Come on down to the grand opening of the Flim Flam Brothers' Everything Under the Sun Emporium. 
    Granny Smith Since when do you play the bass?

My Past is Not TodayEdit

    

        Power 
        Was all I desired (I desired, all I desired) 
        But all that grew inside me 
        Was the darkness I acquired 

        When I began to fall 
        And I lost the path ahead 
        That's when your friendship found me 
        And it lifted me instead 

        Like a phoenix burning bright 
        In the sky 
        I'll show there's another side to me 
        You can't deny 

        I may not know what the future holds 
        But hear me when I say 
        That my past does not define me 
        'Cause my past is not today 

        Ambition 
        Is what I believed 
        Would be the only way 
        To set me free 

        But when it disappeared 
        And I found myself alone 
        That's when you came and got me 
        And it felt like I was home 

        Like a phoenix burning bright 
        In the sky 
        I'll show there's another side to me 
        You can't deny 

        I may not know what the future holds 
        But hear me when I say 
        That my past does not define me 
        'Cause my past is not today 

Friendship Through the AgesEdit

    

        Nothing stays the same for long 
        But when it changes doesn't mean it's gone 
        Time will always get away 
        As it leaves behind another day 

    

        Things may come and things may go 
        Some go fast and some go slow 
        Few things last, that's all I know 
        But friendship carries on through the ages 

    

        Things may come and things may go 
        Some go fast and some go slow 
        Few things last, that's all I know 
        But friendship carries on through the ages 

    

        Been around for a long time 
        Rocking out hard 'cause I'm in my prime 
        Maybe it'll change further down the line 
        But my friendship carries on through the ages 

    

        Every single style has something 
        Different it can say 
        There's nothing wrong with being unique 
        And special in your own way 

    

        Maybe you wanna be a pop star 
        Get your fifteen minutes of fame, wha, ah! Ah, oh! 
        That won't last forever 
        But friendship remains the same, ah-oh, oh! 

    

        Things may come and things may go 
        Some go fast and some go slow 
        Few things last, that's all I know 
        But friendship carries on through the ages 

    

    

        But friendship carries on

        But friendship carries on 

        Ohhh-oh, carries on...

        (Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh) 

    

        Or you can sing like a star 

    

        And the music, yeah, the music 
        Gets us to the top 
        As we learn how the rainbow... 
        Rainbow Rocks! 

        As we learn how the rainbow... 
        Rainbow Rocks! 

     
    Sunset Shimmer Want some help? 
    Apple Bloom Uh, no thanks. We're good. 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh. Okay. 
    Pinkie Pie Sunset Shimmer! Over here! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer  I had no idea the whole school would be here. 
    Rarity Quite the eye-catching advertisement, if I do say so myself. 
    Pinkie Pie And it smells like cake! 
    Fluttershy It does?  
    Pinkie Pie I used frosting instead of paste! 
    Applejack Uh, Fluttershy, you've got a little somethin', uh... 
    Fluttershy Did I get it? 
    Applejack Heh, not exactly. 
    Principal Celestia Good afternoon, students. I just wanted to tell you all how pleased I am that so many of you are going to participate in the first ever Canterlot High School Musical Showcase! 
     
    Principal Celestia This is a wonderful opportunity to raise money for all our after-school programs here at CHS. So keep working on those signs and posters. I think it's going to be one of the most exciting events we've had at CHS since the Fall Formal. 

    Sunset Shimmer Ugh! I am never gonna live that down. 
    Fluttershy You were pretty bad at the Fall Formal. 
    Sunset Shimmer A demon. I turned into a raging she-demon. 
    Pinkie Pie And tried to turn everyone here into teenage zombies for your own personal army! 
    Rarity Oh, darling, you have us, and we've forgiven you for your past... ahem... booboos. 
    Applejack To be honest, I'd say the whole experience brought everyone at Canterlot High closer than ever before! 

    Pinkie Pie One, two, three! 

    

        There was a time we were apart 
        But that's behind us now 
        See how we've made a brand new start 
        And the future's lookin' up, ah-oh, ah-oh 
        And when you walk these halls 
        You feel it everywhere 
        Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah! 

        We are all together 
        (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        Now it's better than ever 
        (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        You can feel it, we are back (You... can... feel... it...) 
        And I'm so glad that we're better 
        Better than ever 
        Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Oh yeah, we're better than ever 
        Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        There was a time we couldn't see 
        Past the differences 

    

        That separated you and me 
        And it left us on our own 

    

        But now you walk these halls 
        And friends are everywhere 

    

        Yeah, we're the Wondercolts forever, ah-oh, yeah! 

        We are all together 
        (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        Now it's better than ever 
        (Ah, ah, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        Now that we are back on track (Now... that... we... are...) 
        Yes, I'm so glad that we're better 
        Better than ever 

        Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Oh yeah, we're better than ever 
        Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Oh yeah, we're better than ever 
        Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Oh yeah, we're better than ever! 

    Sunset Shimmer  
    Rarity  I still can't believe that happens when we play! Ooh! I've got to look into some new accessories! Something that looks good in a longer ponytail. Ooh! Maybe some clip-on earrings for when I get those adorable pony ears. 
    Applejack I just wonder why it happens. Princess Twilight took her crown back to Equestria. Shouldn't that mean she took all the magic back with her? 
    Rainbow Dash Who cares why it happens? It makes my band totally awesome! 
    Rarity Oh! Your band? 
    Rainbow Dash Duh! It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase. Plus I'm the lead singer and guitarist. 
     
    Flash Sentry Uh, heard you outside. You guys are sounding really tight. 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, we're getting there. Rarity's still coming in a little late on the second verse, and Applejack's bass solo could use a little work. They'll get it together in time for the showcase. 
    Flash Sentry Uh, I don't suppose any of our friends from, uh... out of town might come? Uh, it being a special charity event and all. 
    Applejack Sorry, Flash. I don't think Twilight's gonna be back at Canterlot High any time soon. 
    Flash Sentry  Oh, yeah. Okay. I just, you know, thought I'd ask. Uh, k-keep on rockin' it. 
     
    Rarity Well.  Oh. Sorry. I always forget you and Flash used to be an item. 
    Sunset Shimmer It's okay. Flash is a great guy and all, but I never really liked-him liked him. I was just using him to become more popular. Ugh! The old me really was just awful, wasn't she? 
    Rarity Mmm... horrid. 
    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy Mm-hmm, uhhh, etc. 
    Pinkie Pie Yep! 
    Applejack But the important thing is that you've turned yourself around. 
    Sunset Shimmer Thanks, Applejack, but I'm not sure everyone else at CHS feels the same way. 
     
    Vice Principal Luna Sunset Shimmer, please report to the main foyer. 
    Sunset Shimmer Gotta run. I volunteered to show some new students around the school. Thought it'd be good for them to get to know the new me before they heard all the stuff about the old me. 
    Rainbow Dash We've still got a few minutes before lunch starts. What do you say we do "Awesome As I Wanna Be"? 
    Fluttershy Um, Rainbow Dash? I was wondering if we could maybe play the song I wrote? 
    Rainbow Dash We'll get to it. 
    Fluttershy Oh. Okay. 
    Rainbow Dash  

    Sunset Shimmer Hi. Are you the girls I'm supposed to show around? 
    Adagio Dazzle We are. 
    Sunset Shimmer Canterlot High is a great school. You're really gonna love it. 
    Adagio Dazzle Oh, yes, we really sense there's something... magical about this place. 

    Sunset Shimmer That's the science lab. Computer lab is in there. Oh! We're having a big musical showcase this weekend! The whole school is pretty much rallying around it. 
    Adagio Dazzle  A musical showcase? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'm sure since you're new, Principal Celestia would let you sign up if you're interested. 
    Aria Blaze We have been known to sing from time to time. 
    Sonata Dusk Hello? We sing, like, all the time! It's how we get people to do what we want. 
    Adagio Dazzle  
    Sonata Dusk Wha-What did I say? 
    Adagio Dazzle What you meant to say was that being in a musical showcase sounds like a great way to meet other students. 
    Sonata Dusk Ohhhh, yeah. Th-What she said I meant to say. That's what I meant. To say. 
    Aria Blaze  And what you would have said if you weren't the worst. 
    Sonata Dusk You are! 
    Adagio Dazzle You'll have to excuse them. They're idiots. 
    Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk Hmph. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer  Those are pretty. Where did youâ€” 
    Adagio Dazzle  Sorry. These pendants mean an awful lot to us. We'd just hate for anything to happen to them. 

     
    Applejack So how was the tour? 
    Sunset Shimmer I don't know. I mean, these girls, they were... There was something off about them. 
    Pinkie Pie Like, off like this? Or off like this? Or... Oh, oh! Likeâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash Maybe we should just let her tell us. 
    Sunset Shimmer That's just it. I can't put my finger on it. They just acted sort of... strange around me. Maybe someone already talked to them. Told them about what I did.  So much for making a good first impression. 
    Fluttershy Uh-huh. Oh, that's probably not it. 

    Adagio Dazzle This is it, girls. The moment we've been waiting for. 
    Sonata Dusk Lunch?! 
    Adagio Dazzle  The chance to get our true Equestrian magic back. 
    Sonata Dusk Oh. Right. 
    Adagio Dazzle Our voices are just strong enough to make them want something so badly, they'll fight to get it. 
    Aria Blaze So we're just gonna do what we always do? Stir up some trouble and then feed off the negative energy?  Some plan, Adagio. 
    Adagio Dazzle It won't be the same as the times before! There is Equestrian magic here. Their negative energy will give us the power we need to get this entire world to do our bidding. 
    Sonata Dusk But we can get lunch after though, right? It's Taco Tuesday! 
    Adagio Dazzle Just follow my lead. 
    Aria Blaze Or my lead. 
    Adagio Dazzle My lead! 

    

        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh 
        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh 
        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh 
        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ahh 

    

        We heard you want to get together 
        We heard you want to rock this school 
        We've thought of something that is better 
        Something that changes all the rules 

        Why pretend we're all the same 
        When some of us shine brighter? 

    

        Shine brighter 

    

        Here's a chance to find your flame 
        Are you a loser or a fighter? 

    

        Me and you, you and me 
        Why don't we see who is better? 
        We don't have to be one and the same thing 
        Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition? 
        Are you afraid of failing the audition? 

    

        You're a star and you should know it 
        Yeah, you rise above the rest 
        It doesn't matter who you hurt 
        If you're just proving you're the best 

    

        Ah, ahh-ahh-ahhh 

        Battle! You wanna win it 
        Let's have a battle, battle of the bands 
        Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it 
        Let's have a battle, battle, battle 
        Battle of the bands 

     

        Battle! 

    "Blueberry Cake" I can beat you! 
    The Dazzlings and students Battle! 
    "Cherry Crash" Ha! You wish! 
    The Dazzlings and students Battle! 
    Trixie Lulamoon I so want this! 
    The Dazzlings and students Battle! 
    "Captain Planet" Not if I get it first! 

    

        Me and you, you and me 
        Why don't we see who is better? 
        We don't have to be one and the same thing 
        Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition? 

    

        I'm going out and winning the audition 

    

        Battle! We wanna win it 
        Let's have a battle, battle of the bands 
        Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it 
        Let's have a battle, battle, battle 
        Battle of the bands! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Ohhhh. They're that kind of "off". 

    Sunset Shimmer Those three are definitely in possession of some kind of dark magic. How else could you explain what happened back there? 
    Applejack Don't worry, y'all. We'll let Principal Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb in no time. Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by some power-crazed lunatic.  Er, no offense. 
    Sunset Shimmer  None taken. 

    Principal Celestia Dark magic? I find that very hard to believe. Those girls came into my office earlier and were absolutely delightful. 
    Vice Principal Luna Ugh! Perhaps Sunset Shimmer is just eager to make someone else out to be a bad element, so that her actions at the Fall Formal will become old news. 
    Sunset Shimmer I could see why you might think that, butâ€” 
    Rainbow Dash That's not what's happening! We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too! 
    Principal Celestia Yes, but isn't your band supposed to be part of the Musical Showcase? 
    Rainbow Dash Yes. 
    Vice Principal Luna Perhaps you're all just worried that the Dazzlings will steal your spotlight. 
    Applejack The "Dazzlings"? 
    Principal Celestia It's the name of their musical group. That's why they came by my office earlier today â€“ to sign up for the Showcase. Even sang a little song to Vice Principal Luna and I. 
    Applejack They did? 
    Principal Celestia Yes. And we think having a Battle of the Bands instead is a marvelous idea. 

    Fluttershy I can't believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too. 
    Rainbow Dash They've gotten to everybody. 
    Pinkie Pie Not everybody! 
    Applejack Pinkie Pie's right. We were there when the Dazzlings were singin' and we weren't affected. It was like we were protected somehow. 
    Rainbow Dash So let's take them down! It's not like we haven't tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry butt! Uh, no offense. 
    Sunset Shimmer  None taken. Again. 
    Fluttershy But that was when Twilight was here. There may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play music. I sure don't know how to use it to... whoop anybody's butt. 
    Rarity  If only we could get a message to Twilight. Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings have cast on our friends. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, that's not gonna happen. The portal's closed. 
    Rarity  
    Rainbow Dash And I get the feeling they don't exactly have cell phones where she's from. 
    Sunset Shimmer I may have an idea how we can get in touch with Princess Twilight! 

     
    Sunset Shimmer When I was Princess Celestia's student back in Equestria, she gave me this. Even after I abandoned my studies, I held onto it. Deep down, I guess I knew I was making a big mistake, and I wanted to still have a way to reach out to her. Maybe it still works. 
    Rarity That's a book, darling. What do you mean, "maybe still works"? 
    Sunset Shimmer It used to be that if I wrote something here, it would appear in the pages of a book back in Princess Celestia's library. I get a message to her, then she can get a message to Princess Twilight. 
    Rainbow Dash So what are you waiting for? Get to writing! 
    Sunset Shimmer  Been a long time since I've written these words. "Dear Princess Celestia..." 

    Delivery Pony Excuse me, Princess. Where do you want all these books from Princess Celestia? 
    Twilight Sparkle The library. Third door on the left. 
    Delivery Pony Even this one that's glowin' and vibratin'? 
     
     
    Fluttershy What is it, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle It looks like a message to Princess Celestia from my friends at Canterlot High. 
    Rarity How is that even possible? 
    Twilight Sparkle I have no idea, but it... sounds like they need my help. 

    Twilight Sparkle The way Sunset Shimmer described them, I think these new girls sound an awful lot like... the sirens. 
    Pinkie Pie Not the sirens!  I don't actually know what that is! 
    Twilight Sparkle The sirens were three beautiful but dangerous creatures who had the power to charm ponies with their music. But to maintain this power, they had to feed on the negativity and distrust of others. The more of this negative energy they consumed, the stronger their voices became, and the farther they could spread their dark magic. 
    Fluttershy I don't think I like this story very much. 
    Twilight Sparkle If the sirens had their way, they would have divided and conquered all of Equestria. But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded wasn't having it. Rumor has it he found a way to banish them to another world â€“ one where he believed their magic power would be lost. That world must have been the one where my Canterlot High friends live. 
    Applejack But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago. How come they're just surfacin' now? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know. But if my hunch is right and it is the sirens who have come to Canterlot High, this spell they've cast is just the beginning. My friends need me. I have to get back to them. 
    Rainbow Dash I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally cut off for a super long time. 
    Pinkie Pie Okay, first of all, if there was bubble-blowing going on, why wasn't I told about it?! And secondly, if the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a message to Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Pinkie, you're a genius! 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, I get that a lot.  Now about those bubbles... 
     

    Twilight Sparkle ...And the interval between the two points is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the separation between the points along three spatial dimensions. 
    Spike Say what now? 
    Pinkie Pie Duh! She's gonna take the magic in here and put it in there. That'll make the portal open up so that whenever she wants to, she can go from here to there. There to here. Here to there. Here there! Here there! Hereâ€” 
    Applejack We get the idea! 
    Twilight Sparkle Now to see if it actually works. 
     
    Main cast Ooooh... 
     
    Main cast Ahhhhh... 
    Applejack Don't suppose we could join you this time around? 
    Twilight Sparkle Better not. It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had two of all of you. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Spike But I still get to go, right? There isn't another one of me at Canterlot High. And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm. 
    Spike Yes! 
    Twilight Sparkle We won't be gone long. 

    Fluttershy 
    Oh, you be careful, Twilight. 

    

    Rainbow Dash 
    Take care! 

    

    Applejack 
    Y'all be safe now. 

    Rarity And don't forget to dress well. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Ready, Spike? 
    Spike  Ready! 

    Rainbow Dash  I'm starting to think she's not coming. 
    Sunset Shimmer, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie Twilight! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oof. I'm back. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle And I've got some bad news about those new girls. 
    Rest of main cast  

    Rarity Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis. There's so much catching up to do! 
    Applejack For starters, a certain blue-haired guitar player was just askin' about you. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Rarity Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world? 
    Spike She's got an official title now.  The Princess of Friendship! 
    Sunset Shimmer Wow, that's really impressive. Guess you really were Princess Celestia's prized pupil. 
    Spike She's even got her own castle! 
    Rarity A castle?! You have your own castle?!? Eh...  Ooh, uh, lovely. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's new here? I mean, besides your school becoming the target of dangerous magical creatures from Equestria? 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, so, that isn't exactly the only strange thing that's happened since you left. Pretty sweet, huh? It happens to all of us when we play. 
    Twilight Sparkle Hmm. My crown was returned to Equestria, but some of its magic must have remained here at Canterlot High. Now that we're all back together, we can use that magic on the sirens. Just like when we were able to use it on Sunset Shimmer when she turned into that horrifyingly awful winged monster! No offense. 
    Sunset Shimmer  None taken. Heh. I'm used to it. 
    Rainbow Dash They'll never even know what hit 'em!  
    Applejack We've got nothin' to worry about now that Twilight's back. 
    Fluttershy Oh, I'm pretty sure I could find something to worry about. But it won't be the sirens. 
    Twilight Sparkle The sooner we do this, the better. Any idea where the Dazzlings might be? 
    Pinkie Pie  There's a big party tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase! That would include the Dazzlings. 
    Twilight Sparkle Looks like we've got a party to crash. 
    Pinkie Pie  

     
    Flash Sentry  I'm gonna get more punch! 
     
    Flash Sentry Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Eh, bumped, into, always, doing? 
    Flash Sentry What are you doing here? You came back for the big competition, right? 
    Twilight Sparkle Something like that. 
    Flash Sentry Huh. Not that there's gonna be any real competition. No one here wants this as bad as my band does! 
    Twilight Sparkle Can you excuse me for just a minute? 
     
    Adagio Dazzle  Oh, no! No one's mingling! It's like there's some kind of underlying tension that could bubble to the surface at any minute! 
    Sonata Dusk It's the fruit punch, isn't it? I knew I used too much grape juice! 
    Adagio Dazzle It's not the fruit punch! It's us! 
    Aria Blaze But the punch is awful, too. 
    Sonata Dusk What do you know about good fruit punch? 
    Aria Blaze More than you! 
    Sonata Dusk Do not! 
    Aria Blaze Do too! 
    Adagio Dazzle This is just the kickoff party, girls. Imagine what a tizzy they'll be in by the time the Battle of the Bands starts. 
    Twilight Sparkle There isn't going to be a Battle of the Bands! We're gonna make sure of that! Alright, girls, let's do this! Friendship is magic! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Uh, weren't there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't understand. We're all together again. Why isn't this working? 
    Spike You, uh... really need to go ahead and do that whole "magic of friendship" thing now. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm trying, Spike. I thought the six of us standing together against the sirens would bring out the magic we needed to defeat them. That's what happened before. 
    Adagio Dazzle Talk about throwing down the gauntlet! This group is obviously serious about winning! A little cocky though, aren't they? Claiming there won't really be a battle. Seems they think they've already got this thing all locked up. 
    Trixie Lulamoon Not if the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie has anything to do with it! 
    Flash Sentry Whatever, Trixie! We're the best band at CHS! 
    Apple Bloom No! The Crusaders are gonna win! 
     
    Adagio Dazzle I think we may have found what we're looking for. Or rather, it found us. 
    Aria Blaze  
    Adagio Dazzle Magic!! Don't you see?! Everyone else has fallen under our spell. But not these girls. These girls are special. 

    Twilight Sparkle It doesn't make any sense. I should have been able to create the spark that would help us break their spell. That's how it worked before. 
    Sunset Shimmer But to defeat me, you drew magic from the crown I was wearing. The sirens' magic comes from their music. So maybe you have to use the same kind of magic to defeat them. Or... maybe not. 
    Twilight Sparkle No. I think you're onto something. 
    Sunset Shimmer Really? 
    Twilight Sparkle It's when you play music that you transform now, right? 
    Applejack Yup. Ears, tails, the whole shebang. 
    Twilight Sparkle So maybe the way to use that magic to defeat the sirens is by playing a musical counter-spell! 
    Fluttershy You mean like a song? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. And in order to free everyone who's been exposed to the sirens' spell, we'll need them all to hear it. 
    Rest of main cast Hmmm... 
    Rarity  The band competition! That's the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time. 
    Applejack Guess the Rainbooms are the band to beat. 
    Rarity And I believe you, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms' newest member. 
    Rest of main cast  
    Pinkie Pie So what do you wanna play? Triangle?  Soooo magical. 
    Twilight Sparkle I might take a little too long to learn how to play something with these. I'll just sing. 
    Rainbow Dash Like, as in, lead singer? Cuz that's usually my gig. This being my band and all. 
    Applejack It's our band! And, of course, as lead singer. She's the one with the magical know-how to help us pull this thing off. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay, yeah, that's cool. I'll just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's only temporary. And we don't have to win the Battle of the Bands. We just have to perform during the first round of the competition. 
    Rainbow Dash Let's get to learning that musical counter-spell! 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, that's just it. I don't know any. 
    Rest of main cast Awww... 
    Twilight Sparkle But I'm sure I could figure out how to write one. 
    Spike Totally! Twilight can write a spell like it's nobody's business. That's pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria. 
    Twilight Sparkle Technically, I helped finish a spell. And there was a little more to it than that, Spike. 
    Spike Yeah, whatever. 
    Twilight Sparkle I've got this.  C'mon! 
    Applejack Where're you goin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Well, last time we were here, Spike and I spent the night in the library. 
    Pinkie Pie Are you crazy?! We're besties now! Slumber party at my house! 

     
    Pinkie Pie Status update "Okie-dokie-lokie." 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Hey! I was about to beat you! 
    Rainbow Dash I doubt it. So, Twilight, how is that counter-spell comin'? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great. Thanks for letting me use your notebook, Fluttershy. I really like the song you wrote for the Rainbooms. 
    Fluttershy Thanks.  Hopefully one day, we'll get a chance to play it. 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Hey! 
    Rarity Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come back to help us. 
    Rest of main cast Uh-huh. 
    Applejack Darn tootin'. 
     
    Pinkie Pie Pizza's here! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Pinkie Pie Don't you want any pizza? 
     
     

    Rest of main cast  
     

    Twilight Sparkle  No. That's not gonna work. 
    Sunset Shimmer Hey, Twilight. You're up late. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just looking over the counter-spell. We only get one shot at this. It has to be perfect. 
    Sunset Shimmer We really are lucky you're here. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's what everyone keeps telling me. 
    Sunset Shimmer Who could possibly need this much whipped cream? Must be nice to have everyone always looking to you for answers to their problems... instead of waiting for you to cause a problem. 
    Twilight Sparkle Just because everyone expects something from you doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen. 
    Sunset Shimmer Well, that doesn't stop them from expecting it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Which only makes things harder because the last thing you want to do is... 
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer ...let everybody down. 
    Sunset Shimmer Waaah! 
    Maud Boulder was hungry. 
    Sunset Shimmer I still can't get over the fact that she's related to Pinkie Pie. 
    Twilight Sparkle You and me both! 
    Sunset Shimmer  I better get some sleep. Good luck with the counter-spell. Not that you'll need it. This must be nothing compared with the stuff you're expected to deal with as a princess in Equestria. 
    Twilight Sparkle Sunset Shimmer? ...Never mind. It's not important. No, I have to be able to do this. I have to. 


    

         
        Hey, hey, listen 
         
        We've got a message for you 
        We're not all alike 
        But our friendship is true 

        Yeah, we're really different 
        But we still get along 
        So hey, hey, listen to our song 

        You may think you're in control 
        But we're here to prove you wrong 
        With our friendship and our music 
        With the power of our song 

        Gonna stomp our feet, clap our hands 
        With the magic of friendship 
        Gonna stop your evil plan 

    Spike Eh, that sounded... way better than the last... five times you've played it. Heh heh. 
    Big McIntosh Nnope. 
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash I think it's pretty obvious what's going wrong with this counter-spell. 
    Applejack You're turnin' what should be the chorus into a five-minute guitar solo? 
    Rainbow Dash I have to pick up the slack somehow! Are you guys even trying?! 
    Fluttershy I'm trying. 
    Twilight Sparkle It's fine.  It'll be fine. One more time from the top! 
    Rarity Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on some of the wardrobe choices I've put together? I'm particularly fond of this one. Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more modern. 
    Applejack We're tryin' to save our school here. Enough with the costumes! 
    Rarity  Oh, you can never have enough costumes! 
    Pinkie Pie She just wants to make things fun! Isn't that what being in a band supposed to be?  
    Sunset Shimmer You don't have time for any of this! You're supposed to check in at the Battle of the Bands in fifteen minutes! 
    Main cast  Oh, no! 
    Twilight Sparkle What? But it's not ready! If we play our counter-spell in the first round and it doesn't work, the sirens will know what we're up to and make sure we don't get a chance to play it again! 
     
    Applejack Then we'll have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep workin' on it! 
    Rarity But how do you propose we do that? 
    Rainbow Dash We compete in the Battle of the Bands for real! I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals! We unleash the counter-spell then!  You'll have figured it out by finals, right? 
    Spike Of course she will. Twilight Sparkle's never met a problem she couldn't solve. Right, Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle  Right. 
    Rainbow Dash Then let's go win us a Battle of the Bands! 

    Principal Celestia Welcome to the first ever Canterlot High School Battle of the Bands. I believe I speak for everyone when I say it is by far the greatest thing we have ever done here at this school! 
     
    Principal Celestia We are so glad our three newest students encouraged us to turn this event into something exciting! 
    Vice Principal Luna But, as this is now a competition, we can only choose one winner. Who is it going to be? 
     
    Male Student You're the worst thing to happen! 
    Adagio Dazzle You feel that, girls? Our true power is being restored. 
    Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk  
    Adagio Dazzle And that's before we've tapped into the strongest magic here. 
    Aria Blaze But the Rainblossoms, or whatever they're called, aren't under our spell. How exactly are we supposed to get to their magic? 
    Adagio Dazzle The Rainbooms are just as capable of falling apart as anyone else. They just need a little... push in the wrong direction. I have a feeling everyone here is going to be lining up to give them a shove. 

    

         

    

        Aw, yeah! Snips and Snails indahouse, yo! 

    

        They call me MC Snips and that ain't no lie 
        My favorite food is like pumpkin pie 

    

        I'm DJ Snazzy Snails, I like whales 
        When I go to the beach, I always bring my pails 

    

         
        Everybody knows my favorite color is orange 
        My rhymes are so fly, they're better than... um... 

    

        Than an orange, yo! 

    

        Yeah! 

    

        Yeah! 

    

        Represent! 

    

         

    

        What do we... What do we do now? 

    

        Get off the stage, I'd like to leave right now 

    

         

    

        Bam! That just happened! 

    

        Aw, yeah! We out! 

    

        Snips and Snails outta here! 

     
    Principal Celestia Please do not drop the microphones. 
    Snips Yeah! Bam! 
    Snails  
    Snips In your face, Rainbooms! 
    Applejack Least we know one group who won't stand in the way of us gettin' to the finals. 
    Rainbow Dash Let's get ready to rock! 
    Pinkie Pie Wait! Where's Rarity? 
    Rarity Oh! Here! I'm here!  
     
    Rarity We will be performing in front of an audience. I'm not going to wear something fabulous? Hmph. 
    Applejack Guh... 

     
    Twilight Sparkle Remember, we have to be good enough to make it through but not so good we let the sirens see the magic within us. They could realize we plan to use it against them. 
    Rainbow Dash Got it! Be cool enough to win, but not so cool that we end up showing off the whole ears and tails and rainbows thing. Sooo... about twenty percent less cool. 
    Pinkie Pie One! Two! 

    

        We've just got the day to get ready 
        And there's only so much time to lose 
        Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party 
        So let's think of something fun to do 

        We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen 
        We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right 
        All our friends are here 
        And it's time to ignite the lights! 

        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 
        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 

    

        So what you didn't get it right the first time 

    Apple Bloom Boring! 

    

        Laugh it off, no one said it is a crime 

    

        Do your thing, you know you're an original 

    

        Your ideas are so funny that they're criminal 

    

        Ohhh-ahh! 

    Twilight Sparkle  

    

        We've just got the day to get ready 
        And there's only so much time to lose 
        Because tonight, yeah, we're here to party 
        So let's think of something fun to do 

    Snips and Snails  
    Snips Awesome. 

    

        We don't know (we don't know) what's gonna happen 
        We just know (we just know) it's gonna feel right 
        All our friends are here 
        And it's time to ignite the lights! 

        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 
        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 
        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 

    Rarity  

    

        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight 
        Shake your tail, shake your tail 

        Shake your tail 'cause we're here to have a party tonight! 

    Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna  
    Rarity Ruined! Absolutely ruined! 
    Applejack Rarity, were you tryin' to make us lose out there?! 
    Rarity Wh- Oh! This was not my fault! This was an act of sabotage! 
    Applejack Yeah, well, whoever did this couldn't have done this if you didn't insist on dressin' like... like... this! We need to sound good! Is there some reason that concept seems to escape you? 
    Rainbow Dash And what was with the confetti, Pinkie Pie? How am I supposed to shred if there's paper stuck in my frets?! 
    Fluttershy It was pretty distracting... 
    Pinkie Pie Ugh! Says the girl who was running from a light the whole time! A light! 
    Sunset Shimmer You still sounded much better than most of the other bands. I'm sure you'll make it to the next round. But it won't matter if you don't have that counter-spell ready. You all find a place to practice where the sirens can't hear you. I'll keep an eye on things around here. 
    Derpy  

    Twilight Sparkle I don't think we should use a classroom.  We really need to stop bumping into each other like this. 
    Flash Sentry  Uh, you guys hear something? 
    "Brawly Beats" Uhh-uhh. 
    "Ringo" Uh, nope. 
    Twilight Sparkle I said, we have to stopâ€” 
    Flash Sentry There it is again. So annoying. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why are you acting like this? I thought we were friends. 
    Flash Sentry Yeah, and then you decide to come back here just so you can beat me in the Battle of the Bands. I want this, Twilight, and you're trying to take it from me! Some friend. 
    Twilight Sparkle That's not whyâ€” 
    Applejack Come on, Twilight. We've got things to do. 
    Flash Sentry You really think you're gonna help them?! Ha! I bet you have no idea what you're even doing! 
    Adagio Dazzle  Tears already? This is only the first round. 
    Aria Blaze and Sonata Dusk  
    Principal Celestia The next band to take the stage will be Trixie and the Illusions. 
    Adagio Dazzle Better head back. We're supposed to go on after Trixie. 
    Sunset Shimmer You're never gonna get away with this. 
    Adagio Dazzle Why? Because you didn't? Oh, we know all about you, Sunset Shimmer. You've got quite the reputation at Canterlot High. 
    Sunset Shimmer I've changed! I'm in a much better place now! 
    Aria Blaze Waiting in the wings while your friends have all the fun? 
    Adagio Dazzle Oh, yes, you girls are so tight. And yet... they didn't ask you to be in the band. 
    Aria Blaze Probably afraid no one would want to see them play if she was in the group. 
    Sonata Dusk Too bad! So sad! 
    Adagio Dazzle If it's any consolation, no one is going to remember you at all by the time we're done. 

    Adagio Dazzle Remember, girls. We want to save the good stuff for when our full power has been restored. 

    

        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        You didn't know that you fell 
        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        Now that you're under our spell 

        Blindsided by the beat 
        Clapping your hands, stomping your feet 
        You didn't know that you fell 

    

        Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh 

    

        Now you've fallen under our spell 

    

        Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh 

    

        We've got the music, makes you move it 
        Got the song that makes you lose it 
        We say "jump", you say "how high?" 
        Put your hands up to the sky 

        We've got the music, makes you move it 
        Got the song that makes you lose it

        You didn't know that you fell 
        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Now that you're under our spell 

    

        Listen to the sound of my voice 

    

        Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh 

    

        Soon you'll find you don't have a choice 

    

        Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh 

    

        Captured in the web of my song 

    

        Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh 

    

        Soon you'll all be singing along 

    

        Oh, whoa, oh 

    

        We've got the music, makes you move it 
        Got the song that makes you lose it 
        We say "jump", you say "how high?" 
        Put your hands up to the sky

        You didn't know that you fell 
        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Now that you're under our spell 

        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        You didn't know that you fell 
        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        Now that you're under our 

    

        Spell 

     
    Sunset Shimmer This is it! Last round and you're in the finals! Unless you think the counter-spell is ready to be played now. 
    Applejack Don't worry, Twilight. Finals aren't until tonight. We'll get in a little more practice before we're supposed to hit the stage. We won't let you down! 
    Rest of main cast  
    Twilight Sparkle You won't let me down... 
    Fluttershy Um, I was just wondering. We haven't played any of my songs yet, and... 
    Rainbow Dash It's the semifinals. We gotta do "Awesome As I Wanna Be". 
    Fluttershy Don't know why I even asked... 

    

        ...I got tricks up my sleeve 
        See me dominate 
        'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat! 

    Crowd  
    Principal Celestia  Fantastic! 
    Trixie Lulamoon Hmph. You're never gonna top that performance, "Rain-goons". You shouldn't be allowed to when you have such a big advantage over the rest of us. 
    Rainbow Dash My superior guitar playing and off-the-charts awesome singing voice? 
    Trixie Lulamoon Oh, don't be ridiculous. I mean her! If you were really all that, Rainbow Dash, you wouldn't have needed to bring in some magical ringer to have half a chance. Everyone's talking about it. 
    Rainbow Dash Ha! Puh-leeze! I could win this thing as a solo act and everybody knows it! 
    Trixie Lulamoon  Sure you could. 
     
    Main cast  
    Pinkie Pie She's gone!  Oh, wait. There she is. 
     
    Principal Celestia Next up, the Rainbooms. 
    Spike Knock 'em dead, Rainbooms! 
    Sunset Shimmer I'll be here... just... watching. 

    

        Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

    

        Awesome as I wanna be 

    

        Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

    

        Awesome as I wanna be 

        First you see me riding on a sonic boom 
        Got my guitar shreddin' up my latest tune 
        There is nothin' you can do to beat me 
        I'm so good that you can't defeat me 

    

        Yeah, I'm awesome, take caution 
        Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be 
        (Yeah!) I'm awesome, take caution 
        Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be 

    

        Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
        Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 

     
     
    Fluttershy  
    Flash Sentry Now that's the bad girl we love to hate! 
    Crowd  
    Octavia Melody I knew she was still trouble! 
    Male student The real Sunset Shimmer is back! 
    Sunset Shimmer No. It isn't like that. 
    Rainbow Dash What was that?! 
    Sunset Shimmer You were showing them your magic. I-I didn't know what else to do. 
    Rarity Ugh. Close the curtains? Unplug her amp? Give us a chance to deal with the situation? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'm sorry, I just wanted to help. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well, you didn't. 
    Applejack None of this would've happened if you weren't tryin' to show off â€“ as usual. 
    Trixie Lulamoon Good show, "Rain-brooms". I especially liked the part where Sunset Shimmer, in a fit of jealous rage, knocked out Rainbow Dash mid-guitar solo! 
    Sunset Shimmer It wasn't a fit of jealous rage! 
    Trixie Lulamoon If you say so. Ooh! Looks like they've already decided who'll be moving on to the finals! I'm guessing it wasn't too difficult a decision. 
     
    The Dazzlings  
    Sunset Shimmer Huh? 
    Rarity What can we do? There isn't gonna be another opportunity for us to play. And I had the most gorgeous outfit for the finals! 
    Applejack Yup, 'cause that's the real tragedy here, Rarity â€“ that you won't get to play dress-up! 
    Rarity You know perfectly well that is not what I meant! 
    Rainbow Dash You guys wanna keep it down? They're about to announce who's moving on. 
    Fluttershy Who are you kidding? You know it isn't gonna be us. 
    Principal Celestia The band that will be joining the Dazzlings in tonight's finals... The Rainbooms! 
    Trixie Lulamoon What?! 
    Main cast Huh? 
    Pinkie Pie Did they just say, "the Rainbooms"?! 
    Trixie Lulamoon This isn't over! 
    Principal Celestia Congratulations, girls. You deserve it. 
    Pinkie Pie Seriously?! We didn't even finish ourâ€”! 
    Adagio Dazzle See you at tonight's big show, Rainbooms. We are really looking forward to it. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, well... not as much as we are! 
    Crowd  
    Photo Finish Zis never should haf been you, Rainbooms! 
    Crowd  
    Trixie Lulamoon This is a travesty! A travesty! 
    Adagio Dazzle It really is! The Rainbooms don't deserve to be in the finals. Not when your band was so much better in the semis. 
    Aria Blaze And wanted it so much more. 
    Adagio Dazzle Alas, this is the way it's going to be. Dazzlings vs. Rainbooms. 
    Sonata Dusk Unless, of course, the Rainbooms don't manage to make it to their set or held up for some reason. 
    Trixie Lulamoon Hmm...  

    Rainbow Dash Check, one, two. Testing, testing...  Testing...! 
     
     
    Fluttershy This doesn't make any sense. We were awful. Doesn't anybody else think it's strange that we're the ones that made it to the finals? 
    Trixie Lulamoon Very strange. 
    Rainbow Dash What are you doing here, Trixie? Pretty sure the losers are supposed to be up there in the cheap seats. 
    Trixie Lulamoon The Great and Powerful Trixie is the most talented girl at Canterlot High. It is I who deserves to be in the finals. And I will not...  ...be denied! 
     
    Rainbooms and Sunset Shimmer  
    Trixie Lulamoon  See you never! 
     
    Adagio Dazzle  Told you someone would give them a shove. 
    Sonata Dusk She didn't shove them. She pulled a lever. 
    Aria Blaze  Go back to sleep, Sonata. 

    

        Ya better believe 
        I got tricks up my sleeve 
        And I captivate 
        'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat 

    

        Oh, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh 

    

        Ya better believe 
        I got tricks up my sleeve 
        See me dominate 
        'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat 

    

        Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh 

     
    Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Give it up, Rainbow Dash. You've been tryin' at this for hours. It's not gonna open. 
    Twilight Sparkle Maybe it doesn't even matter that we're trapped down here. I don't think the counter-spell would have worked anyway. 
    Applejack Of course it would have worked, Twilight. Assumin' a certain band member didn't try to hog the spotlight the whole time we were tryin' to play it! 
    Rainbow Dash Hey! If you wanna tell Twilight she's getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band, you don't have to be all cryptic about it. 
    Rarity She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Me?! I'm just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to! 
    Rarity, Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie OUR BAND!! 
    Twilight Sparkle But why wasn't it working? I should know what to do. How could I not know what to do? How could I have failed like this? 
    Applejack It might've been your idea to start a band, but it's not just your band, Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash I'm the one who writes all the songs! 
    Fluttershy I write songs! You just never let us play any of them! 
    Rarity I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear! 
    Applejack Again with the costumes! No one cares what we're wearin'! 
    Rarity I care, Applejack! So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band! 
    Pinkie Pie Hey! Anybody here remember fun?! I'll give you a hint It's the exact opposite of being in the Rainbooms! 
    Rainbow Dash I wish I never asked any of you to be in my band! 
    Rarity I wish I'd never agreed to be in it!!!! 
    Fluttershy and Applejack Me neither! 
    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie  

    

        Ya better believe 
        I got tricks up my sleeve 
        See me dominate 
        'Cause I'm powerful and grea-ea-eat! 

     
     
    Trixie Lulamoon Try to top that! 
    Adagio Dazzle  Oh, gosh! I don't know if we can! 
    The Dazzlings  

    

        Ahh, ah-ah, ahh 
        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
        Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 

    Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity and Pinkie Pie  
    Sunset Shimmer Stop! You have to stop! This is what they've been after all along! They're feeding off of the magic inside you! 
    Applejack How can they be using our magic? It's the magic of friendship. 
    Sunset Shimmer Ever since you started this band, you've been letting little things get to you. I never said anything 'cause I didn't feel like it was my place. Not when I'm so new to this whole "friendship" thing. I still have a lot to learn. But I do know that if you don't work out even the smallest problems right at the start, the magic of friendship can be turned into something else. 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe all this tension was happening right under my nose and I didn't realize it. I'm supposed to be the one with all the answers. And all I've done since I got here is let you down. 
    Sunset Shimmer I don't think anyone is supposed to have all the answers. But you can count on your friends to help you find them. 
    Twilight Sparkle I think you already have. C'mon! We need to get out of here! 
     
     
    Twilight Sparkle Spike! 
    Spike Sorry I took so long. I had to find somebody who wasn't under the sirens' spell to help me get you out. 
    Twilight Sparkle Why isn't she under their spell? 
    Spike Never takes off her headphones. 
    Applejack Come on, y'all! Time to prove we've still got the magic of friendship inside us! 
    Twilight Sparkle And there's only one way to do it! 
    Pinkie Pie We're getting the band back together? 
    Rainbow Dash We're getting our band back together! 
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
    Rarity Ooh, which version of the counter-spell are we going to play? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think it matters what song we play, as long as we play it together as friends. 
    Rainbow Dash I know just the song. Fluttershy's written a really great one. 
    Fluttershy  
    Applejack We're about to save the world here. Personally, I think we should do it in style. Rarity? 
    Rarity I thought you'd never ask! 

    

        Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

        Your time is running out 

    

        Ah, ah, ah 

    

        Ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... 

    Rainbow Dash How are we supposed to play over them from up here? 
     
    The Rainbooms  
    Pinkie Pie Awesome! 
    Rainbow Dash Sweet! 

    

        Feel the wave of sound 
        As it crashes down 
        You can't turn away 
        We'll make you wanna sta-a-a-ay 

        We will be adored 
        Tell us that you want us 
        We won't be ignored 
        It's time for our reward 

        Now you need us 
        Come and heed us 
        Nothing can stop us now 

    

        Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh 
        I've got the music in me 
        Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        Don't need to hear a crowd 
        Cheering out my name 
        I didn't come here seeking 
        Infamy or fame 

    

        The one and only thing 
        That I am here to bring 
        Is music, is the music 
        Is the music in my soul 

        Gonna break out (Out!) 
        Set myself free, yeah 
        Let it all go (Go!) 
        Just let it be, yeah 

        Find the music in your heart 
        Let the music make you start 
        To set yourself apart 

    Adagio Dazzle So the Rainbooms want to turn this into a real Battle of the Bands? Then let's battle! 

    

        What we have in store (ah-ah) 
        All we want and more (ah-ah) 
        We will break on through (ah-ah) 
        Now it's time to finish you! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Sirens  
    Twilight Sparkle Sunset Shimmer, we need you! 

     

    

        You're never gonna bring me down 
        You're never gonna break this part of me 
        My friends are here to bring me 'round 
        Not singing just for popularity 

    

        We're here to let you know 
        That we won't let it go 

    

        Our music is a bomb and it's about to blow 

    

        And you can try to fight 
        But we have got the light of 

    

        Friendship on our side! 

        Got the music in our hearts 
        We're here to blow this thing apart 
        And together, we will never 
        Be afraid of the dark 

        Here to sing our song out loud 
        Get you dancing with the crowd 
        As the music of our friendship 
        Survives, survives! 

    

        Got the music in our hearts 
        We're here to blow this thing apart 
        And together, we will never 
        Be afraid of the dark 

        Here to sing our song out loud 
        Get you dancing with the crowd

        We will be adored 
        Tell us that you want us 
        We won't be ignored 
        It's time for our reward... 

    Crowd  
    Sunset Shimmer Guess that explains why these were so special to them. 
    Twilight Sparkle Without those pendants and the magic you brought here from Equestria, they're just three harmless teenage girls. 
    Flash Sentry Rainbooms rule! That was amazing! 
    Sunset Shimmer and Main cast sans Twilight  
    Trixie Lulamoon You may have vanquished the Dazzlings, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie! 
     
    Main cast, Sunset Shimmer, and Flash Sentry  
    Pinkie Pie She's gone!  Oh, wait. There she is. 
     
    Trixie Lulamoon Trixie's okay! 
    Rainbow Dash You know, Twilight is going back to Equestria soon. The Rainbooms could really use someone to help Fluttershy on backup vocals. 
    Sunset Shimmer  I also play guitar. 
    Rainbow Dash We'll see. 

    Applejack Sure wish you could stay longer. 
    Twilight Sparkle Me too. But I have responsibilities in Equestria that I have to get back to. Its citizens need me. But now I can go through the portal whenever I need to. This isn't goodbye. It's just goodbye 'til next time. Ready? 
    Spike Ready! 

    Sunset Shimmer  Dear Princess Twilight, 
    Missing you already, and I hope you'll be back soon. Things are definitely looking up for me here at Canterlot High. But I know I still have a lot to learn about friendship. Hope you don't mind if I write to you for advice when I need it. 
    Your friend, Sunset Shimmer. 
    Rainbow Dash You ready or what? 
    Sunset Shimmer Ready! 
    Pinkie Pie One! Two! Three! Four! 

     

    

        Once upon a time 
        You came into my world and made the stars align 

    

        Now I can see the signs 
        You pick me up when I get down so I can shine 

    

        Shine like rainbows 
        Shine like rainbows 

    

        Friends, you are in my life 
        And you can count on me to be there by your side 

    

        And when the music comes alive 
        We sing our songs to lift us up so we can shine 

    

        And the sound that we hear in our hearts 
        Makes a crescendo 
        And the light that ignites in the dark 
        It makes us all glow 

        And shine like rainbows 
        We shine like rainbows 

        Together we stand 
        As the rain begins to fall 
        And holdin' our heads up high 
        As the sun shines through it all 

    

        And the sound that we hear in our hearts 
        Makes a crescendo 
        And the light that ignites in the dark 
        It makes us all glow 

        And shine like rainbows 
        We shine like rainbows 
        Shine like rainbows 
        We shine like rainbows 

    

        We shine like rainbows 

    Sci-Twi No doubt about it, Spike. There's definitely something strange going on at that school...

The Science of MagicEdit

    The Rainbooms  Huh? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, I thought we were rehearsing. 
    Sunset Shimmer Well, you are. Sort of. Back when I was Princess Celestia's student, I learned best by going out into the field and actually doing something. Studying ancient books is fine for some people, but I like to solve magical mysteries by rolling up my sleeves and getting my hooves... uh, hands dirty. 
     
    Applejack I can relate to workin' hard outdoors, but what the hay does that have to do with us playin' music? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'm trying to figure out how magic works here. Why you grow ears, tails, and wings when you pony up and what your instruments have to do with it. 
    Fluttershy Um, are you sure we need to figure it out? 
    Sunset Shimmer It'll be fun. Just start playing. You won't even know I'm here. 

    

        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

    Applejack  

    

        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 

     

    

        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah, bah, bup, bah 
        Bah, bah, bah-da, bah 
        Yeah, yeah, yeah 

     

    Sunset Shimmer Finally, after all this testing, I've come to a definitive conclusion!  

Pinkie SpyEdit

     
    Rainbow Dash Crystal Prep High School. The competition! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Hey, Rainbow! 
    Rainbow Dash Gah! What are you doing? 
    Pinkie Pie You said we needed to be sneaky while we check out the competition for the Friendship Games. Wanna see what else I have? Cat burglar! Dog burglar! Tree! Bunny suit! Camouflage! 
    Rainbow Dash That's, like, the opposite of camouflage! Quick! Get down! 
     
    Rainbow Dash We need to get a better view! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Best view in the house! 
     
     
     
     
    Pinkie Pie  You smell like vanilla. 
    Rainbow Dash We're trying to eavesdrop! That means they don't hear us! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh! I have just the thing! 
    Crystal Prep Student  
    Rainbow Dash What are you doing?! We're trying to spy on them! Do you even know what the word "spy" means? It means being sneaky! It means not being seen! It means BEING QUIET! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Bush to Dash. Code red. You have been spotted. RUUUUUUUUUUUNNN! 

All's Fair in Love & Friendship GamesEdit

     
    Sweetie Drops And then I said... 
    Lyra Heartstrings "It tastes like marshmallows"? 
    Sweetie Drops Yeah, so that made me... 
    Lyra Heartstrings ...feel like you were on a camping trip? 
    Sweetie Drops Yes! Just likeâ€” 
    Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops That time we went to the amusement park in eighth grade! 
    Sweetie Drops  You know me so well!

    Lyra Heartstrings  You made the team! 
    Sweetie Drops  You made the team! 
    Lyra Heartstrings Best! 
    Sweetie Drops Friends! 
    Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops Forever!  

Photo FinishedEdit

    Vice Principal Luna Photo Finish, our yearbook photos this year could use a bit more... mmm, pizzazz. Would you like to take some pictures forâ€” 
    Photo Finish Say no more! I, Photo Finish, will kepture za magicks! I go! 

    Photo Finish Shtop! Hold that pose!  Ja! You are shtarving! Now take a bite! No! Do not bite it! Yes! Yes! No. No! 
     
    Photo Finish Enough! I go! 

     
    Photo Finish Shports!  
     
    Photo Finish Jump! Jump! Like a beautiful gresshopper! Like a graceful gazelle! You are striving to place the orb of desire in the net of the future! 
     
    Photo Finish Enough! I go! 
     

    Photo Finish Yes! Read! You are so very intrigued by the story! No, no! That book is out of order! It does not comply vith the Dewey Decimal System!

    Vice Principal Luna Photo Finish, I have been receiving a number of complaints from students and faculty about you! Do you have anything to say for yourself? 
    Photo Finish I say nothink. Photo Finish lets her work speak for itself. 
    Vice Principal Luna These are really impressive! You may continue, but do try to be less disruptive. 
    Photo Finish Hold that pose! Ja, ja! You have the authority! Sign the waiver!  
    Vice Principal Luna Hold on! What theâ€”?!  

A Banner DayEdit

    Vice Principal Luna I'm sure you'll come up with the perfect sign that lets the Crystal Prep kids feel welcome but also conveys that we are stiff competition. 
    Micro Chips 100 percent! 
    Flash Sentry Oh, yeah, sure! 
    Sandalwood Totally. 
    Vice Principal Luna I'll be back in an hour to see what you've come up with. 

    Flash Sentry I got it! We should decorate it with the sheet music to my song "Love in a Flash". It'll show them we're talented while welcoming them in with the universal language of music. 
    Micro Chips I was thinking we could paint a model of DNA. It shows that we're smart but invites them in with the very fiber of our being. 
    Sandalwood But what we should do is portray peace through art. One love, bros. 
     

     
     
     
    Sandalwood Dude! 
    Micro Chips  What did you do?! 
    Flash Sentry Watch the hair, man! 
     
     
    Sandalwood You're harshing the flow! 
    Micro Chips Hey, you did that on purpose!  My friendship algorithm! 
    Flash Sentry Hey! You just projectile-scienced all over my chorus! 
    Micro Chips Well, you guys painted all over my molecular structures! 
    Sandalwood And how am I supposed to paint my spirit guide when there's DNA and a treble clef in the way? 
    Flash Sentry Oh, I don't know! Ask your spirit guide! 
    All You're ruining my design! 
    Vice Principal Luna  My, oh, my. 
    Micro Chips We're reallyâ€” 
    Vice Principal Luna Proud of yourselves, I hope. This is wonderful! 
    Flash Sentry It is? 
    Vice Principal Luna It's inspiring but still warm and welcoming. I love how your work is literally enmeshed. Truly excellent work, boys. 
    Flash Sentry Uh, thank you! This is just what happens when you allow love to lead the way. 
    Micro Chips With song. 
    Sandalwood Through the self-replicating material present in nearly all living organisms. 
    Vice Principal Luna  That's great to hear. Now just add "Welcome Crystal Prep", and I'd like to see five more by the end of the day. Thanks, boys! 

My Little Pony Equestria Girls Friendship Games

    Sunset Shimmer I got your text, Rainbow Dash! Did something come through the portal? Is Equestrian magic on the loose? Did Twilight come back with a problem that only we can solve?! 
    Pinkie Pie Has a giant cake monster covered all the cakes in the world in cake?! 
    Rainbow Dash Um, not exactly. 
    Sunset Shimmer Uh, I don't understand. 
    Applejack Well, Sunset, I was just tellin' Rainbow Dash here that a broken guitar string doesn't really qualify as an emergency. 
    Rainbow Dash It totally does! 
    Rarity Really, Rainbow Dash! I was in the middle of sewing a very complex appliquÃ© on my latest frock. 
    Fluttershy And I was just about to tuck everyone in for the night at the shelter. Now we'll have to start stories all over again. 
    Sunset Shimmer Why would you send all of us an emergency text for a guitar string? 
    Rainbow Dash Well, I was going to pony up and show our fans some awesome guitar licks, but I kinda need all six strings to do it. Got any extra? 
    All but Rainbow Dash  
    Sunset Shimmer Here. But everyone finished practicing for the day. I'm pretty sure all the music rooms are locked. 
    Rainbow Dash No problem. The acoustics in the hallway are perfect for power chords.  C'mon! Let's go! 
    Applejack You comin', Sunset? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'll catch up in a bit.  Dear Princess Twilight, how's life treating you in Equestria? Any cool new magic spells? It's been pretty quiet here at CHS since the Battle of the Bands. We still pony up when we play music, which Rainbow Dash just loves to show off. But I still can't quite grasp what it's all about. I would love to hear what you think about it when you get a sec. Your friend, Sunset Shimmer. 
     
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer Hey! What are you doing?! Wait! Stop! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Who was that? 
    Sci-Twi  

    

        Ahhh-ohhh... 
        Ahhh-ohhh... 
        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 

        Ha! 

        Ahhh-ohhh... 
        The Friendship Games! 

         

        We've come this far 
        And we're not goin' back (No way!) 
        Prepare yourself 
        Cause we're on the attack (Attack!) 

        Won't have to find us 
        We'll be tracking you down (Right now!) 
        And when we're finished 
        We'll be takin' the crown 

        All the way (all the way) 
        All the way to the Friendship Games 
        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 

        All the way (all the way) 
        All the way to the Friendship Games 
        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 

        Hey! Ho! 
        Hey! Let's go! 

    

        We studied hard 
        And we're here to win 

    

        Whoa-oh 

    

        We're only tellin' you once 

    

        Our magic comes from the inside out 

    

        What you see's what you get 
        Don't you ever forget 

    

        All the way (all the way) 
        All the way to the Friendship Games 
        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 

        All the way (all the way) 
        All the way to the Friendship Games 
        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 

        Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 
         Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 
         Na, na, na-na-na, oh 
        Na, na, let's go! 

    Sunset Shimmer She was definitely doing something to the statue â€“ or was going to. 
    Fluttershy Do you think she came through the portal from Equestria? 
    Sunset Shimmer No, I'm pretty sure I woulda noticed that. I think she was from over here. 
    Applejack Well, that's a relief. The last thing we need is another magical so-and-so bent on world domination comin' over from Equestria. 
    Rarity Agreed. I have no interest in another fight against the powers of evil magic. The wear and tear on my wardrobe is just too much to keep up with. 
    Sunset Shimmer Still, a mysterious figure snooping around the portal? Don't you wanna know what she was up to? 
    Fluttershy  I don't even wanna guess. 
    Rainbow Dash Well, you don't have to. Because I've totally figured out who it was! 
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, ooh! A nighttime statue cleaner? A magical portal maintenance maintainer? A gardener?! 
    Rainbow Dash Seeing as how they got off a bus from the city and got back on a bus headed to the city, I'll bet they go to... 
    All but Sunset Shimmer Crystal Prep. 
    Rainbow Dash Yep. With the Friendship Games starting tomorrow, they'd totally try to prank us by defacing the Wondercolts statue. 
    Sunset Shimmer Why would anyone take a bus all the way from the city for that? 
    Applejack Because the Crystal Prep Shadowbolts are our biggest rivals? 
    Rarity Because that's just what the students at Crystal Prep would do? 
    Rainbow Dash Because even though they beat us in everything â€“ soccer, tennis, golf â€“ they still have to gloat! 
    Sunset Shimmer Seems kinda silly to me. 
    All but Sunset Shimmer Silly?! 
    Rainbow Dash So I guess you think the Friendship Games are silly, too. 
    Sunset Shimmer Well, it's not like we'll be fighting the powers of evil magic. 
    Fluttershy No. We'll be fighting against a school full of meanies. Not everything has to be magical to be important. 
    Sunset Shimmer You're right. I'm sorry. I know it's a big deal. 
    Rarity  That's putting it mildly, darling. They're still revamping the playing field in preparation. 
    Sunset Shimmer I just don't understand why there's this big rivalry. Aren't the "Friendship Games" supposed to be about our two schools getting along? 
    Applejack Well, it's kinda hard to get along with someone who beats you at everything. 
    Rainbow Dash Not anymore! This time, things are gonna be different. 
    Sunset Shimmer What do you mean? 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, you'll find out. 

    Principal Celestia As I am sure you all know, tomorrow, Canterlot High School will be hosting our fellow students from Crystal Prep Academy as we join together in the spirit of excellence, sportsmanship, and fidelity to compete in the Friendship Games. 
    Students  
    Principal Celestia Since the games only happen every four years, I'm sure you're all curious what goes on. 
    Flash Sentry You mean other than us losing?! 
    Principal Celestia And that is exactly why I've asked Rainbow Dash to come up and give you all a little, um... context. 
     
    Rainbow Dash Thank you, Principal Celestia.  I know a lot of you might think there's no way we can beat a fancy school like Crystal Prep at anything. 
    Pinkie Pie Unless it's a "losing to Crystal Prep" competition! 'Cause we're really good at that! 
    Rainbow Dash  And I know that CHS has never won the Friendship Games even once. 
    Rarity Oh, dear. I hope this speech isn't meant to be motivational. 

    Rainbow Dash Crystal Prep students are super athletic, super smart, and super motivated. But there's one thing they aren't. They aren't Wondercolts! 

        We've fought magic more than once 
        And come out on top 

    

        Oh, oh 

    

        There's other schools, but none can make those claims 

    

        Na, na-na-na-na, oh 

    

        Together we are Canterlot 
        Come and cheer our name 

    

        Oh, oh 

    

        This will be our year to win these games 

    

        We'll always be Wondercolts forever 
        And now our time has finally arrived 
        'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship 
        And you know, at the end of the day, it is we who survive 

         

    

        Hey! 

    

        We're not the school we were before 

    

        Before! 

    

        Yeah, we're different now 

    

        Oh, oh 

    

    

        Hey, hey! 

    

        We overcame the obstacles we faced 

    

        Overcame the obstacles we faced 

    

        Hey! 

    

        We're Canterlot united 

    

        Unite! 

    

        And we'll never bow 

    

        Oh, oh 

    

    

        Hey, hey! 

    

        So get ready to see us in first place 

    

        We'll always be Wondercolts forever 
        (Three! Two! One! Go!) 
        And now our time has finally arrived 
        (Our time is now!) 
        'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship 
        And you know, at the end of the day, it is we who survive 
        At the end of the day, it is we who survive 

        Na, na, na-na-na-na 
        Wondercolts united together 
        Na, na, na-na-na-na 
        Wondercolts united forever 

        Na, na, na-na-na-na 
        Wondercolts united together 
        Na, na, na-na-na-na 
        Wondercolts united forever 

        Na, na, na-na-na-na 
        Wondercolts united together 

    

    

        We'll always be Wondercolts forever 
        And now our time has finally arrived 
        'Cause we believe in the magic of friendship 
        And you know... 

        At the end of the day, it is we who survive 
        At the end of the day, it is we who survive! 

     

    Fluttershy Rainbow Dash, that was amazing! Even I feel like we can win! 
    Rarity I feel like my school pride is at an all-time high! 
    Applejack Is anybody else wonderin' how Dash ponied up without playin' her guitar? 
    Rainbow Dash I know, right? It's probably because I'm so awesome! 
    Sunset Shimmer Maybe. I mean, you are awesome, but there's gotta be more to it than that, right? It just seems so random. 
    Vice Principal Luna Well, it would be nice if you girls could get a handle on it. We'd like to keep magic as far away from the Friendship Games as possible. We don't want to be accused of cheating. 
    Rarity We don't need magic to defeat those hoity-toity Crystal Preppers. 
    All but Rarity, Sunset Shimmer, and Luna  
    Rarity  
    Vice Principal Luna Still, the Friendship Games are serious business. We don't want any surprises. Especially the kind that could cause us to forfeit. Sunset Shimmer, you came here from a world of magic. Perhaps you can get to the bottom of our magical development. 
    Sunset Shimmer I'll do my best. 
    Rainbow Dash Okay. Anybody have any guesses what the events are gonna be? 
    Pinkie Pie Pie eating? Cake eating?  Pie-cake eating?! 
    Applejack They won't even let us see what they're doin' to the field. You think they'd at least tell competitors what they're competing in. 
    Fluttershy It could be anything. 
    Rarity Anything?! How will I ever pick the right outfit?! 
    Sunset Shimmer I really wanna help, but I think I better go focus on figuring out why Rainbow Dash ponied up. See ya later! 
    Pinkie Pie Seems like she's got everything under control. Nothing to worry about. 

    Sunset Shimmer Ugh!  Hey, Twilight. Haven't heard back from you yet. I guess you must be pretty busy with your role as princess. But I could really use your advice right now. You see, I've been given the job of keeping magic under control here at CHS, even though I still haven't quite wrapped my head around it. And now after seeing Rainbow Dash pony up the way she did, it makes me think her magic might be... changing. Everyone is looking to me to figure things out and I really don't wanna let them down. But I'm not sure I have enough experience with friendship magic to solve this. 

     
    Sci-Twi  Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. 

    Puppy Spike  
     
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Spike? Spike?! 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi  There you are. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Okay, okay! Last night's field test confirmed it, Spike. With this device, I can track and contain the bizarre energy coming from Canterlot High. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi I know you didn't like me going over there, but I just couldn't wait. And soon, I'll have all the time I need. All of Crystal Prep is gonna be there for the Friendship Games. I just hope all that "rivalry" nonsense doesn't get in the way of my research. If I can collect enough data on these EM frequencies, I should be able to extrapolate the waveforms to determine their origin. That would practically guarantee my entrance into the Everton Independent Study Program! Whoa! 
     
    Dean Cadance Twilight, you know the rules against pets. 
    Sci-Twi Well, Spike isn't a pet, Dean Cadance. He's the focus of my research project. Human-canine cohabitation effects and implications. 
    Dean Cadance If you say so. But Principal Cinch is highly allergic, so I suggest you put on a clean shirt. 
    Sci-Twi Why? 
    Dean Cadance Because she wants to see you. 
    Sci-Twi Ooh! Maybe she has news about my application to Everton! 
    Dean Cadance I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Are you sure that's what you really want? 
    Sci-Twi Why wouldn't it be? A program that allows me to focus all my attention on my own advanced math and science projects? What a dream come true! 
    Dean Cadance But there aren't any classrooms with other students. You'll be doing everything on your own. 
    Sci-Twi That is why it's called an "independent study program". 
    Dean Cadance I just don't want you to miss out on anything. That's all. Being around other people isn't a bad thing. Sometimes it's how you learn the most about yourself. 
    Sci-Twi I guess. 
    Dean Cadance Meet you in Principal Cinch's office in a few minutes? 
     
    Sci-Twi  It's not like I have anything left to learn at Crystal Prep. 

    

        I've walked through all these halls before 
        I've been in and out of every door, oh-whoa-oh 
        There's nothin' in this school that I don't know 
        In every class, my grade's the best 
        The highest score on every test 
        I think that means it's time for me to go 

        I know there's more that's out there 
        And I just haven't found it yet 
        I know there's more that's out there 
        Another me I haven't met 

        This school is full of people 
        But still I don't belong 
        They only dream of winning 
        Look at me like something's wrong 
        Maybe I'm better off alone 
        Will I find what I'm lookin' for 
        If I just do it on my own? 

        I know there's more that's out there 
        Something to fill this hole inside 
        I know there's more that's out there 
        And I'm not afraid to try 

        There's only so much this school can offer 
        And I'm not saying that it's wrong 
        But I know there's more that's out there 
        'Cause I've been searching all along 

        Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls 
        So much to learn, I can't see it all 
        There's somethin' out there callin' me 
        And it's a mystery that I can't wait to see 

        'Cause I know there's more that's out there 
        Another place, another way 
        And I know there's more that's out there 
        And I'll find out someday! 

        I'll find out someday... 

     
     
     
    Sci-Twi Shining Armor? Why is my brother here? 
    Dean Cadance As an alumni, Principal Cinch thought he could provide some unique perspective. 
    Sci-Twi Perspective on what? 
    Principal Cinch Why, the Friendship Games, of course. You competed in the games, did you not, Shining Armor? 
    Shining Armor  I did. 
    Principal Cinch And you happen to recall who won? 
    Shining Armor Ha ha, Crystal Prep did. We always win. 
    Principal Cinch We always win. 
    Sci-Twi Why did you ask to see me? 
    Principal Cinch Twilight, I'll be honest. It doesn't matter whether or not Crystal Prep wins or loses.  The important thing is we are expected to win because Crystal Prep has a reputation. And it is that reputation... my reputation that is responsible for everything we have here. For everything you've done here. And you've done quite a lot, haven't you? 
    Sci-Twi I don't know. I guess. 
    Principal Cinch Oh, don't be modest. You're the best student this school has ever seen. What I can't understand is why my best student wouldn't want to compete. 
    Sci-Twi In the Friendship Games? 
    Shining Armor Look, Twily, I know it's not really your thing, but representing the school is kind of a big deal. Plus, they could really use your help. 
    Principal Cinch It seems Canterlot High is undergoing something of a renaissance. Test scores are up, grades, even athletics are on the rise. You see, they are developing somewhat of a reputation. This can not happen! 
    Sci-Twi Principal Cinch, I can't possibly participate in the games. My work here is veryâ€” 
    Principal Cinch Ah, yes. Your work. Cadance, could you and Shining Armor find my contact sheet for the Everton Independent Study program? 
    Dean Cadance Of course. 
     
    Principal Cinch I understand you've applied. You see, one of the advantages of having a reputation is a certain amount of influence in such things. So, let me offer you a deal. In return for contributing your agile mind to these games, I will use my influence to guarantee your application is approved. Though, I suppose I could also have it... denied. What do you think I should do? 

    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Ugh! Come on, Spike! I was always gonna go to Canterlot High for the Friendship Games. Ich! The only difference now is that I have to compete. Besides, it's not like Principal Cinch gave me much of a choice. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi I know, Spike. I don't like it either. I probably won't be able to collect anywhere near as much data as I thought. But maybe I can still get some. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Spike, I wouldn't leave without you. Just remember to be quiet. And try not to shed. 
     

    Sci-Twi Dean Cadance, I'm not really sure where to go. 
    Dean Cadance One second, Twilight. 
    Sour Sweet  You could try the end of the line! 
    Sci-Twi What did you say? 
    Sour Sweet  Just that someone as smart as you should definitely go first. 
    Sci-Twi I... I didn't mean to. I was just asking. 
    Dean Cadance This is the right bus, Twilight. Go ahead. 
    Sci-Twi But... I didn't mean to cut in front. 
    Sour Sweet  Well, it's too late now. 
     
    Indigo Zap Are we gonna win?!?! 
    Sci-Twi I... I don't know. 
    Indigo Zap Wrong answer!! Try again! Are we gonna win?!?! 
    Sci-Twi Um... I guess? I-It's just... I mean... I heard that CHS is doing well now. With their reputation. And, I mean, it's not better than ours, of course. But we can't let them do it, you know? Win, I mean? Right? 
    Bus Driver You're gonna have to take a seat! 
    Sci-Twi Hi, Sugarcoat. 
    Sugarcoat That was a really bad speech. You should consider not speaking in public. 
     
    Sci-Twi Well, Spike, at least I've got you with me. 
     
    Lemon Zest Dude, you have gotta hear this! 
    Sci-Twi Uh? Eh! 

     
    Rainbow Dash I hope the Friendship Games have a music competition, because we would totally rock it!  
    Sunset Shimmer Um, we're supposed to keep magic out of the Friendship Games, remember? 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Rarity Easier said than done, darling. I'm sure in Equestria, magic does whatever you want. But... 
    Sunset Shimmer This isn't Equestria. 
    Applejack Well, when it comes to magic, I'm sure you'll figure it out. 
    Rarity And while Sunset works on keeping the magic out of the games, I've been working on what to put in!  
    Applejack Rarity, what'd you go an' do? 
    Rarity Well, I had a little time on my hands, and since we don't know what the Friendship Games' events are, I made a few options for uniforms! 
    Rainbow Dash You really didn't have to do that. 
    Rarity I know. 
    Applejack No. You really didn't have to. 
    Rarity I know!  

    Principal Celestia Vice Principal Luna can help your students get settled if you'd like me to show you around, Principal Cinch. There have been quite a few changes since your last visit. 
    Principal Cinch Oh, yes, Principal Celestia. I'm sure that would be fascinating. 
    Vice Principal Luna Oh, it's always such a pleasure to see you, Dean Cadance. Even if it means another defeat. 
    Dean Cadance Thank you, Vice Principal Luna, but I hear it's not going to be so easy this time. 
    Indigo Zap Comin' through! 
     
    Sci-Twi Oof! 
    Sunny Flare Seriously? 
    Sci-Twi Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to.  Oh, sorry. Why don't you go ahead? 
    Sour Sweet  I am watching you! 
     
    Lemon Zest Ahh! Yeah!  
    Sugarcoat You are kinda being a doormat right now. 
     
    Sweetie Drops Hi, Twilight. 

    "Cherry Crash" Hey, Twilight! 
    "Sweet Leaf" Hi, Twilight. 
    "Mystery Mint" Hi, Twilight. 
    "Scribble Dee" Hey, you. Lookin' good. 
    Sci-Twi Um, hi. 
    "Sophisticata" Hey, what's happenin'? 
    "Blueberry Cake" Really nice to see you. 
    "Velvet Sky" Twilight, how ya doin'? 
    "Starlight" Twilight, yo!  
    Sci-Twi Hi. Hello. Uh, good. 
     
    Flash Sentry Twilight? I almost didn't recognize you. When did you start wearin' glasses? 
    Sci-Twi Um, like, since forever. 
    Flash Sentry Oh, so how long are you here for? 
    Sci-Twi Just for the Friendship Games. 
    Flash Sentry Right. Of course. We'll totally win with you here. 
     
    Sci-Twi Uh, I gotta go. 
    Flash Sentry Uh, okay. Bye? Aw. 

    Applejack Uh, Rarity, these outfits are great, but why would you put so much time and effort into clothes we might not even wear? You're gonna exhaust yourself before the games even start. 
    Rarity Oh, pff. Kch. Fff. Ts! Don't be silly, darling! Putting effort into clothes is what I live for, and spending time on my friends fills me with energy! 
    All but Rarity  
    Sunset Shimmer And magic, too, I guess. 

     
    Rarity  
    Applejack I told you. 
     
    All but Sci-Twi Twilight? 
    Sci-Twi Uh, yes? 
    Applejack Well, I'll be. You shoulda told us you were comin'. 
    Rarity Darling, those glasses. What are you wearing? It's so... severe. 
    Sci-Twi My uniform? 
    Fluttershy Your uniform for what? 
    Sci-Twi For... Crystal Prep. But why does everyone at this school know who I am? 
    Rainbow Dash Did you just say "Crystal Prep"? 
    Puppy Spike  
    Fluttershy and Rarity Spike! 
    Sci-Twi  You know my dog's name, too? 

    Principal Celestia And our music program has especially taken off.  Twilight? 
    Sci-Twi This is getting ridiculous! 
    Principal Cinch I must apologize for the curiosity of my prized student. 
    Principal Celestia Your student? 
    Principal Cinch The smart ones are always curious. I'll return her to check in with the rest of her classmates. 
    Principal Celestia I didn't know Twilight had a twin sister. 
    Pinkie Pie She doesn't! That Twilight is obviously the Twilight from this world since it couldn't possibly be the Twilight from the pony world since the Twilight from the pony world doesn't go to Crystal Prep or wear glasses. 
    Principal Celestia Nevermind. 

    Sci-Twi I'm sorry, Principal Cinch. I was just following these strange readings. Actually, they led me to those girls andâ€” 
    Principal Cinch Twilight, what you do in your free time is of little interest to me, but while you're here, I... all of Crystal Prep, in fact, require your complete focus. 
    Sci-Twi But why does everyone at this school seem to know me? 
    Principal Cinch Perhaps they're trying to confuse you. Perhaps they're trying to lure you away. 
    Sci-Twi It didn't feel like anyone was trying to lure me. 
    Principal Cinch I don't know what they're planning, but I guarantee, it isn't to help us win. 

    Rarity I can't believe our world's Twilight goes to Crystal Prep! 
    Rainbow Dash You're saying that Twilight's gonna play against us? She'd never do that! 
    Fluttershy Our Twilight wouldn't. 
    Sunset Shimmer  Sorry. I'm just frustrated that I haven't heard back from her. 
    Applejack She's a princess in Equestria. Probably got problems of her own to deal with. 
    Rarity We certainly can't expect her to drop everything and pop through the portal whenever. Especially if it's to deal with something as minor as a few random pony-ups. 
    Sunset Shimmer But they aren't minor! Magic came into this world when I stole Twilight's crown. It's taken a lot for me to earn everyone's trust. If we have to forfeit the games because I can't think of a way to keep it under control... 
    Fluttershy Oh, Sunset, I'm sure you'll be able to figure things out. 
    Applejack You're the one who helped us understand what was goin' on with the sirens. Remember? 
    Sunset Shimmer I guess. But Twilight was the one who really figured out what we needed to defeat them. 
    Rarity But don't you remember, darling? What we needed to defeat them was you. 
    Sunset Shimmer  All right. 
    All but Sunset Shimmer  
    Rainbow Dash Come on, guys! Let's see if we can find any info about the events and come up with a strategy. You comin', Sunset? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'll... catch up with you guys in a bit. 

    Sunset Shimmer  Still no reply. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Maybe there's another way I could reach her. Hey, let go! 
     
    Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer  
    Sunset Shimmer What did you do?! 
    Dean Cadance Twilight, you have to check in with the others. 
    Sunset Shimmer Where's the portal?  Where's the portal?! 

     

    Applejack What do ya mean the portal's gone? 
    Sunset Shimmer I mean it's gone. It's closed. It's not there anymore! 
    Rainbow Dash How'd that happen? 
    Sunset Shimmer I don't know. But it has something to do with that Twilight. 
    Applejack What in tarnation is she up to? 
    Indigo Zap Huh? 
     
    Indigo Zap  
    Sunset Shimmer Leave this to me. Twilight, what have you been up to? 
    Sci-Twi Me? Oh, I was just, uhâ€” 
    Indigo Zap Who wants to know?! 
    Rainbow Dash Um, we do. 
    Applejack All right, everyone. Let's not get too competitive before the games even start. 
    Sugarcoat The games aren't really competitive since we've never lost. 
    Fluttershy That's not a very nice thing to say. 
    Sunny Flare Sorry, dearie, but these games aren't about being nice. 
    Rarity Well, you might use a little tact. 
    Pinkie Pie Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie! 
    Sci-Twi Oh, hi. I'm Twilight. 
    Pinkie Pie I know. You look just like my friend. Her name is Twilight too. 
    Sci-Twi That's... heh, weird. 
    Pinkie Pie What's that? 
    Sci-Twi It's sort of a spectrometer. I built it to track EM frequencies, but it can also contain anomalies.  It measures things. 
    Pinkie Pie Like the party? 
    Sci-Twi Yeah, though it doesn't look like much of a party to me. 
    Pinkie Pie I know. Something is definitely missing. Come on! 
    Sci-Twi Aah! 
    Principal Celestia Hello, everyone! I'd like to take this opportunity to greet all of our visitors from Crystal Prep Academy and welcome them to CHS. 
    Sci-Twi  What in the world is in these? 
    Pinkie Pie Party cannons, of course! 
    Principal Celestia And lastly, I would like to recognize the twelve students that CHS has elected to compete. I don't think we could have chosen a better group to represent the excellence, sportsmanship, and friendship the games stand for. 
     
     
    Sci-Twi Um, are you sure this is a good idea? 
    Pinkie Pie Absolutely! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Ooh, floaty! 
     
     
    Pinkie Pie Aw! Oh. I am party pooped. 
     
     
     
     
     
     
    Principal Cinch I'd like to thank Principal Celestia for her unconventional welcome. It's been four years since the last Friendship Games, but it feels as though nothing has changed. Canterlot High continues to pick its competitors in a popularity contest and Crystal Prep continues to field its top twelve students. It is a comfort to know that even after so many years of losses, your school remains committed to its ideals, however misguided they may be. I wish you all the best of luck, regardless of the inevitable outcome. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. 
    Applejack I'm sorry, Pinkie. I thought your party additions were really swell. 
    Fluttershy They definitely broke the ice. 
    Rarity Yes. If only that Principal Cinch hadn't frozen it again. 
    Pinkie Pie Yeah, she's awful. 
    Sunset Shimmer Wow, Pinkie, what happened to you? 
    Pinkie Pie I don't know. Everyone started having fun after Twilight and I fired the party cannons and I ponied up. 
    Sunset Shimmer Of course you did. 
    Pinkie Pie But then the magic just drained right out of me. 
    Sunset Shimmer Wait, what do you mean "drained out of you"? 
    Applejack Hey. Where is that other Twilight? 
    Pinkie Pie Oh. She's right... Uh, well, she was right here. 

    Vice Principal Luna  Good morning, students. I'm sure you're all thrilled to start the first day of the Friendship Games. Our competitors will face off in every aspect of the CHS curriculum, culminating in the elimination equation finale. 
    Dean Cadance Welcome to the first event, the Academic Decathlon! You'll be scored on chemistry, home-ec and everything in between. But remember, only the six students from each team with the most points will move on to event number 2. Good luck! 

    

        Ho! We're gonna take you down 
        Ho! We're gonna take you down! 
        Take you down! (Ho! We're gonna take you down!) 
        Take you down! (Down, down, down) 

    

        (Oh oh!) We're here to take you out 
        (Aw aw!) We're here to take you out (Aw aw!) 
        Take you out! (We're here to take you out!) 
        Take you out! 

    

        We're not about to let you win, so get out of our way 
        Think you got us beat, but we're here to stay 
        United strong, yeah, we'll take you down 
        You're not so tough, now you're in our town 

        All of the times we lost before 
        Not about to give up, we're only bringin' it more 
        We can smell your fear, we can see your sweat 
        Hope you didn't spend money 'cause you're losin' this bet! 

        You've got nothin' on us 
        Na, na, na-na-na, na 
        Let's go, Wondercolts! 
        You've got nothin' on us 
        Na, na, na-na-na, na 
        Let's go, Wondercolts! 

    

        Talk a little too much for a school that never wins 
        Maybe you should just stop 'fore you even begin 
        We are Crystal Prep High and we have a reputation 
        Every little moment is about our education 

        Put your ear to the ground 
        Listen to that sound 
        You're a house of cards 
        And it's about to fall down (fall down) 
        About to fall down (fall down), hit the ground 

        You've got nothin' on us 
        Na, na, na-na-na, na 
        Let's go, Shadowbolts! 
        You've got nothin' on us 
        Na, na, na-na-na, na 
        Let's go, Shadowbolts! 

    

        Pressure's on, now we're gonna beat you 
        Step aside, it's time that we defeat you 
        Crystal Prep yourself 'cause you're about to go 
        Down, down, down, down 

    

        Pressure's on, you know we're gonna take you 
        Just give up before we have to break you 
        Canter-not-a-lot, you're about to go 
        Down, down, down, down 

    

        Take it up to the top 
        'Cause we know we can win 

    

        Maybe you should just stop 
        'Cause we've seen you give in 

    

        We believe in ourselves 
        And we've got what it takes 

    

        And we're not gonna stop 

    

        I can't wait 'til this is all over 
        There's so much more that's going on 

    

        And before these games are over 
        I'll find out just what she's done 

    

        Can she do it? Will she make it? 
        Who will win it? Who will take it? 

        Can she do it? Who will take it? 
        Did she win it? Did she make it? 

        Who's the winner? Who's the reject? 
        How did she answer? 

    Principal Cinch Incorrect! 
     
    Vice Principal Luna That means the winner of the Friendship Games' first event is Twilight Sparkle and Crystal Prep! 
    Crystal Prep Students  
    Rainbow Dash That was awesome! 
    Rarity Truly amazing! 
    Sunset Shimmer But we didn't win! 
    Applejack That was as close to winnin' as Canterlot's ever been. 
    Dean Cadance After a careful tally of the points, we'd like to present the students moving on to the Friendship Games' second event. 
     
    The Main Six  
    Flash Sentry Congratulations! You were really great! 
     
    Sci-Twi I'm sorry. Excuse me. 
    Flash Sentry Okay, then. Aw. 

    Cat  
     
    Fluttershy Do you wanna give her a treat? 
    Sci-Twi Guess I'm not the only one to smuggle her pet into school. 
    Fluttershy  Not just one. 
    Sci-Twi Oh, wow. All I have is Spike. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Fluttershy It really is uncanny. Does he talk? 
    Sci-Twi Um, not that I know of. 
    Fluttershy Congratulations on winning, by the way. Though, it didn't seem like anyone on your team was very excited about it. 
    Sci-Twi No one at my school gets excited about anything they didn't do themselves. 
    Fluttershy That sounds awful.  Here. Hold this. 
    Sci-Twi Um, why? 
    Fluttershy Holding a bunny always makes me feel better. 
    Sci-Twi Well, that's ridiculous. But... Ooh. It actually kind of works. I'm on the other team and you just lost. Why are you being so nice to me? 
    Fluttershy You looked like you needed it. 
     
    Sci-Twi  Whoa! 
     
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Spike! 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi Spike! 
    Fluttershy  
    Sci-Twi Spike, are you okay? 
    Puppy Spike Um, I think so. 
     
    Sci-Twi and Puppy Spike Daaaah!!! 
    Sci-Twi  
    Puppy Spike Twilight, wait! 
    Fluttershy  Bye. 

    Sci-Twi  
    Puppy Spike Twilight, come on! Wait for me!  Why did you run away like that? 
    Sci-Twi Um, oh, I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the glowing girl, or the hole in space. Or my talking dog! 
    Puppy Spike Yeah. Weird, right? 
    Sci-Twi Are you okay? How do you feel? What happened? Where did you go? 
    Puppy Spike Hey, one question at a time! This is pretty new to me, too. 
    Sci-Twi Sorry. 
    Puppy Spike All I know is I chased that pointy rabbit through the glowy thing and then I was somewhere else. Next thing I knew, I was back in that nice girl's arms and I could talk! I don't really understand why I couldn't before. I mean, it's so easy. 
    Principal Cinch Twilight. 
    Sci-Twi Quick! Hide in here! 
     
    Principal Cinch Who are you talking to? 
    Sci-Twi Um, myself. It's a nervous habit. Were you looking for me? 
    Principal Cinch Indeed I was. Quite a coincidence that the CHS students moving on to the next event are the same nice girls who were so interested in you, don't you think? 
    Sci-Twi I'm not sure. 
    Principal Cinch Perhaps you should get to know them after all. 
    Sci-Twi But I thought you didn't want me to. 
    Principal Cinch Let's just say I'm covering my bases. Who knows? Perhaps they will reveal to you the secret to Canterlot High's newfound success. 
    Sci-Twi I dunno. Spying feels kind of... wrong. 
    Principal Cinch Well, it's your decision, Twilight. It's not as if your application hangs in the balance. On second thought, yes, it does. 
    Puppy Spike Man, she's awful. What are you gonna do? 
    Sci-Twi  I don't know, Spike. I don't know. 

    Fluttershy All I did was hand Twilight a bunny. Then I ponied up. 
    Sunset Shimmer I just don't get it. Rarity's magic came out when she made us outfits. Pinkie's when she fixed the party and now Fluttershy. 
    Fluttershy And then Twilight's pendant thingy just pulled the magic right out of me. I couldn't even stand up. 
    Pinkie Pie Like me at the party! 
    Rarity Or me right before we met Twilight! 
    Sunset Shimmer So she's stealing magic? 
    Applejack I don't know. She doesn't seem like the magic-stealin' type. 
    Sunset Shimmer Yeah, but she had something to do with closing the portal. If her pendant can pull in magic, maybe it stole the portal, too. 
    Fluttershy How? 
    Sunset Shimmer I don't know. And the pony or person or princess who could help me figure this out is completely unreachable now. 
    Pinkie Pie Which is too bad, because Twilight knows everything about magic and portals and magical portals and portable magics! 
     
    Rainbow Dash For now, let's just focus on beating the Shadowbolts. And as long as this event puts me in a playing field, I don't think we've got anything to worry about. 
    Applejack Oh, it puts you on a playin' field, alright. 
    Pinkie Pie  
    Sunset Shimmer Am I the only one who thinks this is overkill? 
    Applejack  I don't suppose you made motocross outfits. 
    Rarity Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course I did! 

    Principal Cinch You will race in pairs. Indigo Zap and Sugarcoat will handle the motocross. 
    Indigo Zap Yes! 
    Principal Cinch Lemon Zest and Sunny Flare have requested the short track. 
    Lemon Zest and Sunny Flare  
    Principal Cinch Since archery is a standard requirement at our school, any of you should be able to do it. Twilight and Sour Sweet will start us off. 
    Sour Sweet  If you wanna lose before we even start! 
    Principal Cinch Given that Twilight won the last event single-handedly, I have every confidence that she will be able to pull her weight here. Won't you? 

     
    Dean Cadance Welcome, everyone to the Friendship Games Tricross Relay! 
     
    Dean Cadance In this event, our qualifying competitors will face off in archery, speed skating, and finally, motocross. 
     
    Dean Cadance So if the competitors are ready...  Each competitor must hit a bullseye before their teammates can start the next leg of the relay. 
     
     
    Sour Sweet  
     
     
     
    Sour Sweet  
    Applejack  
     
     
     
     
    Dean Cadance And Canterlot is off to an early lead! 
     
    Sour Sweet  Well, that's just fantastic! 
    Fluttershy I'm sure glad I don't go to Crystal Prep. 
    Applejack You said it. 
    Pinkie Pie Whee! 
    Dean Cadance If CPA can't hit another bullseye soon, they'll be out of this race. 
    Sugarcoat You're really bad at this! 
    Applejack Ugh! I can't take anymore! Ya have to stop aimin' at the target. 
    Sour Sweet  Oh, that makes perfect sense! Don't aim at the target! Thanks so much! 
    Applejack Ya have to stop aimin' at where the target is an' aim at where the target's gonna be. 
    Sour Sweet  you're competing against! 
    Applejack Do you wanna hit the bullseye or not? Then trust me. Take a deep breath. 
    Sci-Twi  
    Applejack And let the arrow go... riiiiight.... now! 
     
     
     
     
    Puppy Spike Yeah! That's my girl! 
    Applejack See? I was tellin' ya the truth. 
     
     
    Applejack Eh... what... are... you... doing?! 
    Sci-Twi I don't know! 
     
     
    Dean Cadance Canterlot only has two laps to go! But it looks like Crystal Prep is making up for lost time! 
     
     
    Rarity Come on! 
     
    Dean Cadance What a finish! 
     
     
    Sci-Twi Aah! 
    Rainbow Dash Awesome! 
     
    Everfree Forest creature  
     
     
    Everfree Forest creature  
    Sunset Shimmer Dash, you saved me! 
    Rainbow Dash I wasn't about to let my friend become plant food. 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash We can still win this! 
    Everfree Forest creature  
     
    Dean Cadance Canterlot wins! 
     
    Dean Cadance Attention, students, please proceed to the gym. 
     
     
    Applejack Is everybody all right? 
    Rainbow Dash Better than all right! We won! 
    Sunset Shimmer Yeah, we won, but somebody could've been seriously hurt. The magic is going haywire and I have no idea how to fix it! 
    Sci-Twi Um, excuse me, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I just wanted to learn about the strange energy coming from your school. I didn't know that it was magic or... how it works. 
    Rainbow Dash That's okay. Neither do we. 
    Sci-Twi Oh, no! Oh, no no no! Not again! 
    Rainbow Dash  
    Sci-Twi I'm sorry! It just started absorbing energy on its own! But I'm not sure how! 
    Sunset Shimmer What do you mean you don't know how?! 
     
    Sci-Twi It also causes these corresponding rifts to appear! I don't know how that works either. 
    Sunset Shimmer Is there anything you do know?! Like how to get our magic back?! Or how to fix the portal to Equestria?! 
    Sci-Twi Equestria? 
    Sunset Shimmer You're supposed to be so smart, but did you ever think that you shouldn't be messing around with things you don't understand?! 
     
    Sci-Twi But I wanna understand! 
    Sunset Shimmer But you don't! And worst of all, you put the lives of my friends in danger! 
    Sci-Twi  
    Puppy Spike Twilight, wait! 

    Principal Celestia  
    Principal Cinch You can't possibly call that a fair race. 
    Principal Celestia Principal Cinch, we all saw what happened. You can't think CHS had some kind of advantage. 
    Principal Cinch Can't I? Even without your trained attack plants, your students have wings! 
    Principal Celestia Well, the race certainly had some... extenuating circumstances. Perhaps we should end the games now and declare a tie. 
    Principal Cinch A tie? Was this your strategy all along? To force us into accepting you as equals? I think not. The games will continue and Crystal Prep will prevail despite your antics and whatever performance-enhancing regimen your students are on. 
    Sunset Shimmer I'm sorry I couldn't stop all this from happening. 
    Principal Celestia It's not your fault, Sunset. 
    Sunset Shimmer Isn't it? I should know how to control the magic I brought here. But I don't. I let everyone down. And now Principal Cinch thinks we're cheating. 
    Principal Celestia It doesn't matter what Principal Cinch thinks. 
    Sunset Shimmer But it does. The students here at CHS don't just wanna win. They wanna beat Crystal Prep. It isn't gonna count if the other side doesn't really think they lost. Crystal Prep is never gonna believe we won fair and square if there's magic around. And that magic is only around... because of me. 

     
    Dean Cadance Since the score's tied, the final event will determine the winner of the Friendship Games. 
    Vice Principal Luna Somewhere on campus, a pennant from each school has been hidden. The first team to find their school's flag and bring it back wins. 
    Dean Cadance And as soon as our teams are ready, we'll begin. 
    Fluttershy I don't feel like playing these games anymore. 
    Rainbow Dash But we have to play. This is the last event! 
    Rarity  It's a little hard to focus with all the magic stealing and portal opening. 
    Sunset Shimmer And I feel awful about what I said to Twilight. 
    Fluttershy Especially since she obviously didn't mean to do all the stuff she did. She's actually really nice. 
    Sunset Shimmer  
    Applejack Let's just get through this last event and prove we're not a bunch of cheaters. Then you can go over and apologize. 

    Principal Cinch I know I'm asking you to beat a team that isn't playing fair, but Canterlot High must be made to understand that even with magic at their disposal, beating Crystal Prep is simply not an option. 
    Sugarcoat What if they grow wings again? 
    Principal Cinch A fair question. Though I believe we can now fight fire with fire. I've seen what your device can do, Twilight. Containing magical energy is fine, but have you considered releasing it? 
    Sci-Twi But I don't even understand how it works. 
    Principal Cinch But you'd like to. And since our opponents have already used it to stay competitive, I see no reason why we shouldn't do the same. Unless, of course, you have no interest in Everton. Though, honestly, I think there's more knowledge packed in that little device than any independent study program could offer. 

    

        I realize that you've always been an outcast 
        It's not everyone at school who likes to think 
        To find a student that's like you 
        I've had one or maybe two 
        But the good ones disappear before I blink 

    

        (Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh 
        Oh, wuh-oh-wuh) 

    

        Now, I understand you have your reservations (oh-wuh) 
        It's hard to have a brain as large as yours (oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        But if we don't win these games 
        Well, I think I've made it plain 
        What will happen if we have the losing scores! 

    

        (Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh 
        Oh, wuh-oh-wuh) 

        Unleash the magic, unleash the magic 
        If we lose, then you're to blame (ah, ah-ah-ah) 
        They all have used it, maybe abused it (ah-ah-ah) 
        So then why can't we do the same? 

        (Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh 
        Oh, wuh-oh-wuh) 

    

        Call it power, call it magic 
        If we lose, it will be tragic 
        More important is the knowledge we'll have lost (oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        A chance like this won't come again 
        You'll regret not giving in 
        Isn't understanding magic worth the cost? 

    

        (Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh 
        Oh, wuh-oh-wuh) 

        Unleash the magic, unleash the magic 
        We're not friends here after all 
        Our only interest in this business (ah-ah-ah) 
        Is seeing Canterlot High School fall 

        (Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh 
        Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh) 

    

        What I'm suggesting's very simple 
        And since it's win-win on all scores 
        You only want to learn about the 
        Magic that you have stored 

        And as for me and all the others 
        We only want what we deserve 
        That our school will clinch the win 
        And my... 

    

        ...legacy will endure 

        Unleash the magic, unleash the magic 
        If we lose, then it's a crime 
        But we can win it if you begin it (ah-ah-ah) 
        It's up to you to not fail this time 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Imagine all I'll learn by setting it free 

    Vice Principal Luna If both teams are ready... 

    

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        And now winning these games depends on me 

    

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

        And what doors might open if I try to use it 

    Dean Cadance ...the last event of the Friendship Games begins... 

    

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        But the magic's what I really want to see 

    Puppy Spike Twilight, no! 

    

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic now 

    

        Unleash the magic, free the magic... 
        Unleash the magic, free the magic... 

    

        Now! 

     
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi  Heeeeeeeeeelllllllp... meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Uhh! Ahh! 
     
    Puppy Spike  
    Midnight Sparkle  You were right! I didn't understand magic before, but I do now! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Equestria! 
     
     
    Sunny Flare Hey! Where are you going?! 
    Principal Cinch Anywhere to avoid that... monster! And I suggest you do the same! 
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, you can't do this! 
    Midnight Sparkle Why not?! There's a whole other world right there, and it's just filled with magic! 
    Sunset Shimmer But you're destroying this world to get it! 
    Midnight Sparkle So what? There's more magic there, and I want to understand it all! 
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer Uhh! 
    Applejack  Don't let go! 
     
    Rainbow Dash Hang on! 
    Rarity Obviously!  
    Indigo Zap We got you! 
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer This isn't the way! I know you feel powerful right now, like you can have everything you want! I've been where you are, I've made the same mistake you're making! I put on a crown and, just like you, I was overwhelmed by the magic it contained! I thought it could get me everything I wanted! 
    Midnight Sparkle Oh, you're wrong. Unlike you, I can have everything I want! 
    Sunset Shimmer No, you can't. Even with all that magic and power, you'll still be alone! True magic comes from honesty! Loyalty! Laughter! Generosity! Kindness! I understand you, Twilight, and I want to show you the most important magic of all... 
     
    Daydream Shimmer ...the Magic of Friendship! 
     
    Midnight Sparkle  
    Puppy Spike Twilight! 
    Sci-Twi Spike? 
    Midnight Sparkle Noooo! 
    Daydream Shimmer Take my hand, Twilight. Let me show you there's another way... just like someone once did for me. 
     
    Sci-Twi I am so sorry... I didn't mean for any of this to happen... 
    Sunset Shimmer I know. And going by my own experiences, they'll forgive you. 
    Puppy Spike  
    Sci-Twi  

    Principal Cinch  Principal Celestia, on behalf of Crystal Prep, I demand that you forfeit the Friendship Games! Clearly, CHS has had unfair advantage for quite some time! And it's certainly obvious that your students have been using magic for their own benefit! 
    Principal Celestia I'd like to think that saving the world benefits us all. 
    Sugarcoat At least they didn't manipulate Twilight into releasing all the stolen magic and turning into a power-crazed magical creature that tried to rip the world apart just to win a game. 
    Pinkie Pie Wow! That's a lot to take in when you say it all at once. 
    Principal Cinch That's ridiculous! 
    Puppy Spike Nope, that's pretty much what happened. 
    Sour Sweet  Mostly it was her. 
    Principal Cinch Obviously my students have been infected with your magic, but I plan on taking all of this up with the school board! 
    Principal Celestia Good. I'm sure they would be very interested in hearing all about the magical students with wings. 
    Vice Principal Luna Oh, and the portals to different dimensions. 
    Dean Cadance And don't forget to tell them about the talking dog.  
    Puppy Spike Because that would never ruin your reputation. 
     
    Principal Celestia Well, I know these Friendship Games haven't been what any of us expected, but given what we've all just been through, I think it's fair to declare us all winners. 
     

    Dean Cadance I guess that was one way to finish up your time at Crystal Prep. Pretty sure Cinch will be fast-tracking your application after all of that. 
    Sci-Twi I've been thinking about it and... I'm not so sure now is the time for me to apply to Everton. 
    Dean Cadance Really? 
    Sci-Twi I may know about a lot of things, but friendship isn't really one of them. And I'm definitely not gonna learn more about it by being alone all the time. 
    Dean Cadance So, you're staying at Crystal Prep? 
    Sci-Twi Well, it seems the students here at CHS know an awful lot about the subject. I don't suppose... 
    Dean Cadance You could transfer to this school instead. 
    Sci-Twi Really? 
    Dean Cadance You'd certainly be missed at Crystal Prep. But I think that's a great idea! I'll be sure to speak to Principal Celestia about it right away. 

    Fluttershy Still no word from Princess Twilight? 
    Sunset Shimmer Not yet. But I think I may have figured out how magic works in this world. We pony up when we're showing the truest part of ourselves. I was so busy waiting for someone else to give me the answers that I gave up looking for them myself. I'm sure there will be more magical problems that pop up in this world, but like Applejack said, Princess Twilight has her own problems to worry about in Equestria. We can't expect her to always be around to help us. 
    Sci-Twi But maybe I can be? 
    Principal Celestia It seems we have a new Wondercolt here at Canterlot High! 
    Sci-Twi I'm not sure how much help I could be. But I'd like to try. If you would all give me a chance. 
    Principal Celestia I'm sure I can count on you girls to help her feel at home. 
    Sunset Shimmer You sure can. 
    Pinkie Pie  

    Twilight Sparkle I'm so sorry I didn't get here sooner! I didn't get your messages until just now because I was caught in this time travel loop and, honestly, it was the strangest thing that's ever happened to me!  
    Pinkie Pie  
    Twilight Sparkle Make that the second strangest. 

     

    

        I spent so much time searchin' 
        Lookin' for somethin' more 
        Diggin' holes too deep 
        And opening every door 

        And when you stand too close 
        Yeah, the picture's never clear 
        And when you look too far away 
        It all but disappears 

    

        And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh) 
        Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        Sometimes the things you want 
        Are not the things you need 
        And it was right there in front of me 

    

        There was a time before 
        I didn't know where I belonged 
        I thought I needed more 
        And that I couldn't get along 

    

        But who I am 
        Was all I ever needed 
        And when I faced that test 
        I finally succeeded 

    

        And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh) 
        Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) 
        Sometimes the things you want 
        Are not the things you need 
        And it was right there in front of me 

        Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        And it's all I'll ever need 

    

        Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        And it was right there in front of me 

    

        Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

    

        And it's all I'll ever need 

    

        Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh 

        And it was right there in front of me-ee-ee 

My Little Pony Equestria Girls Legend of Everfree

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  No... It can't be...! It isn't true...! 
    Fluttershy Um, Twilight? 
     
    Spike  
    Rainbow Dash Twilight! The bus for Camp Everfree leaves in ten minutes! 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, no-no-no-no-no! I can't believe I overslept! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Me neither. That's not like you. 
    Twilight Sparkle I know! 
    Pinkie Pie Don't you have a super-annoying alarm clock that goes ? 
     
    Sunset Shimmer It's gonna be fine. We'll help you pack. 
    Spike  
    Applejack  We're gonna be out in the woods. When is she gonna need that? 
    Rarity If we were going to the moon, I'd insist she packed an evening gown. One never knows, darling. 
    Twilight Sparkle Lemme just get changed. 
    The Equestria Girls Midnight Sparkle?! 
    Twilight Sparkle How is this possible? Sunset Shimmer helped me defeat you at the Friendship Games! 
    Midnight Sparkle You and your friends can never truly defeat me!  
    Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash  
    Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie  
    Spike and Sunset Shimmer  
    Midnight Sparkle Midnight Sparkle's a part of you! I'll always be there waiting in the darkest shadows of your mind! I'll be back, Twilight! And this time, I won't stop until I have all the magic! 
    Twilight Sparkle No! 

    Twilight Sparkle Stop! 
    Spike Twilight, wake up! 
    Pinkie Pie We can't stop, silly! We're not there yet! 
    Sunset Shimmer Hey, are you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Heh. I'm fine. 
    Pinkie Pie We are gonna have so much fun! We're gonna roast marshmallows and eat marshmallows and sleep on marshmallow pillows! 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, probably not gonna do that. 
    Pinkie Pie Maybe you're not. 
     
    Principal Celestia Attention, students, we're almost there. But before we arrive, we just wanted to say how proud we are of you for raising enough money to go on this class field trip. 
    Vice Principal Luna When we were your age, we made some of our favorite memories in these woods, and we're sure you will, too. 
    Principal Celestia Now who's excited for Camp Everfree?! 
    Students  

    

        Will you be lost by time or be part of history? 
        Will your story be told or remain a mystery? 
        Will they sing your song, telling all that you have done? 
        Time to make your choice, only you can be the one 

        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! (Hey!) 
        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! (Hey! Hey! Hey!) 

        Will you do something great with the time that you have here? 
        Will you make your mark? Will you conquer what you fear? 
        And when you go back home, everybody there will see 
        You were part of the Legend of Everfree! 

        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! (Hey!) 
        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! (Hey!) 

        Will you find your greatest glory? 
        Will you be a falling star? 
        Here to learn what nature teaches 
        Here to learn more who you are 

        Will you be lost by time or be part of history? 
        Will your story be told or remain a mystery? 
        And when you go back home, everybody there will see 
        You were part of the Legend of Everfree! 

        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! (Hey!) 
        Oh, oh, oh-oh-whoa 
        As you join in the Legend of Everfree! 
        Hey!ï»¿ 

    Fluttershy Isn't Camp Everfree just beautiful? I can't wait until we have our first nature walk. 
    Spike I definitely wanna go on one of those. 
    Fluttershy You wanna see all the adorable woodland creatures, too? 
    Spike Yeah! Specifically squirrels. More specifically, so I can chase 'em!  
    Applejack I'm just lookin' forward to roughin' it. I'm gonna make my own shelter, forage for food... 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, you know they provide us with food and tents, right? 
    Applejack Yup! Still gonna forage though. 
    Rarity  I'm just after some R&R. The past year has all been a bit too much for my tastes. 
    Pinkie Pie I'll say! We fought three evil sirens who tried to hypnotize everybody with their singing, one ridiculously competitive rival school, and two demon friends!  Uh, heh-heh, no offense. 
    Sunset Shimmer None taken.  You'll get used to it. 
    Applejack Yep. Canterlot High has become a regular magic magnet. Gonna be nice gettin' away to a place where we don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. 
    Flash Sentry Here you go, Twilight. 
    Twilight Sparkle Thanks. It's... Flash, right? 
    Flash Sentry Yup, that's me! And you're you. And we don't know each other very well.  Cool story, bro. 
    Twilight Sparkle Right. I guess I'll... see you around. 
    Sunset Shimmer You know how there's that girl who looks just like you when she's here but lives in another dimension and she's a pony princess? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. 
    Sunset Shimmer Flash kinda had a... thing for her. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh. 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy  Hey, everyone! If you could start heading to the courtyard, that would be rad! It's time to start the best week of camp ever! 

     
    Spike  
    Gloriosa Daisy Hi, everyone! Welcome to Camp Everfree! I'm Gloriosa Daisy, your camp director! Think of me as your friendly camp and nature guide. And this is my brother, Timber Spruce! 
    Timber Spruce Think of me as that awesome guy... who should always be invited to fun things. 
    Gloriosa Daisy We aim to please, so before we hand out our tent assignments, we'd like to hear from all of you. You're free to do whatever you like here. 
    Timber Spruce Uh, except hike near the rock quarry. That's off-limits. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Y-Yes, but otherwise, your options are wide open. So what activities will make this the very best week of your lives ever? 
    Rainbow Dash Ooh! Rock climbing! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Done! 
    Rainbow Dash Archery! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Of course! 
    Rainbow Dash Tetherball! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Naturally! 
    Sunset Shimmer Rainbow, I know you're excited, but maybe give somebody else a chance to make a suggestion. 
    Bulk Biceps Arts and crafts! My mom... needs new pot holders. 
    Gloriosa Daisy I'll supply the looms! 
    Pinkie Pie Cookie decorating!  
    Gloriosa Daisy Ooh, I do make a mean sugar cookie. 
    Fluttershy Early morning nature walks? 
    Gloriosa Daisy With walking sticks for everyone! 
    Rarity Ooh! Me! Oh, uh... a fashion show! Where I design the most fabulous camp looks inspired by today's hottest trends and have them modeled by my classmates in a gorgeous outdoor setting! 
    Gloriosa Daisy A camp tradition! 
    Timber Spruce We have literally never done that. 
    Gloriosa Daisy I'll be taking requests the rest of the time you're here, so if there's anything you'd like to do, anything you need, just ask. 
    Principal Celestia What about the camp gift? That was my favorite Camp Everfree tradition. 
    Gloriosa Daisy The camp gift! Of course! 
    Timber Spruce  Really? 
    Gloriosa Daisy  Yes, really. 
    Timber Spruce  Well, I just thoughtâ€” 
    Gloriosa Daisy  Then you thought wrong! 
    Sunset Shimmer Anyone else picking up on a little tension between Gloriosa and her brother? 
    Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle Ehhh... 
    Pinkie Pie A little. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Every year, campers work together to create something useful. A gift for future campers. Working toward this common goal is key to forming the strong bonds that will last well beyond your time here at camp!  This gazebo was a gift from last year's group. Oh, oh, oh, and the totem pole and the sundial were also made by campers! 
    Principal Celestia The sundial was our year's gift! 
    Vice Principal Luna  Even though "some people" thought it was a little impractical, since the sundial can't be used at night. 
    Gloriosa Daisy  You all seem like a-a really amazing group. So I'm certain you'll come up with something inspiring to leave behind. 
     
    Timber Spruce Speaking of leaving things behind, now's the time when we give out tent assignments so you can leave your heavy bags behind. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Uh, girls will be getting their assignments from Timber. Guys, you're with me. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, boy! Hmm... Yay! I'm in the Emerald Tent! 
    Rarity Ooh, me, too! 
    Applejack Aquamarine. 
    Rainbow Dash Me, too! 
    Applejack Yee-hoo! 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, yeah! 
    Fluttershy I got Amethyst. 
    Sunset Shimmer Sapphire. 
    Twilight Sparkle Me, too! I mean, I'm assuming I am. Heh-heh. Technically, sapphires aren't just blue. Heh-heh. They can be pink, purple, yellow... 
    Timber Spruce Yeah, but they're mostly blue. That's why they're named after the Latin word sapphirus. 
     
    Timber Spruce  That means "blue". 
    Twilight Sparkle  I know. But did you know that sapphires are just rubies without chromium? 
    Timber Spruce No. But did you know that Sapphire Tent is the best one? 
    Twilight Sparkle No. Why's that? 
    Timber Spruce Because you're in it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I bet you say that to all the campers. 
    Timber Spruce Not true.  You're in the Ruby Tent? Ha! That's the worst one! 
    Bulk Biceps Aw, man! 
    Timber Spruce I'm just jokin', buddy. Ruby Tent is great. It's like a sapphire but with chromium. 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Timber Spruce But the Ruby and Coral Tents do look an awful lot alike to the undiscerning eye. I better show you where it is.  See ya around. 
    Rainbow Dash and Sunset Shimmer  
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Applejack Heh. Nothin'. 
    Rarity Ooh! That was adorable! 
    Gloriosa Daisy  Okay, everyone, go get settled in. We'll be meeting at the docks in fifteen minutes to go over some camp safety rules. Let me know if you need anything! 
    Filthy Rich I need somethin'. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Filthy Rich! So nice to see you.  What are you doing here?! Camp is just getting started! 
    Filthy Rich Just takin' in the scenery, Gloriosa Daisy. It's so... hmm... relaxin'. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Well, you can look around when camp is over. Now, if you don't mind... 
     
    Filthy Rich Fine. 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Filthy Rich is, uh, an alumni of the camp. He likes to check on his old stomping grounds every now and again. But enough about him. Find your tents and put away your things. We've got the best week of camp ever to begin! 

    Rarity  I'm all for learning safety rules, but I do hope I can get started on my designs for the camp fashion show sooner rather than later. 
    Applejack Huh. I still can't believe you talked Gloriosa into havin' a fashion show. We're in the middle of the woods, for cryin' out loud! We're s'posed to be roughin' it! 
    Rarity It's clear from Gloriosa's own wardrobe that she appreciates a well put together look. Even if we are in the "middle of the woods". 
    Applejack Fair enough. Just as long as you don't put me in one of your fancy pants outfits. ...You're gonna, aren't ya? 
    Rarity No. Yes!  Don't worry, darling. It'll absolutely speak to your personal sense of style... 
    Sunset Shimmer  That was weird back there, right? With that guy, Filthy Rich? 
    Twilight Sparkle Huh? Oh. Uh, I guess so. 
    Sunset Shimmer I just have this feeling that Gloriosa's hiding something. Her brother is pretty cute, though, huh? 
    Twilight Sparkle He's okay. 
    Sunset Shimmer Ooooh, now look who's trying to hide something. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, I'm not! 
    Sunset Shimmer Hey, you okay? You seemed a little freaked out on the bus earlier. 
    Spike Probably had another one of her nightmares. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm fine. I mean, what do I have to complain about? Ever since I transferred here, everyone from CHS has been really nice and accepting, especially considering what happened at the Friendship Games. 
    Sunset Shimmer That wasn't your fault. Principal Cinch is the one who encouraged you to try and use all that magic to win the Games for Crystal Prep. You weren't ready to have that kind of power. But it's over now. And if there's any group that's gonna forgive you for something that happened in the past, trust me, it's this one. 
    Rainbow Dash You guys comin' or what? 
    Sunset Shimmer Be right there! I just wanna put on some sunscreen. Huh. I coulda sworn I packed it. 
    Twilight Sparkle Found it! 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Did you? How is this possible? 
    Twilight Sparkle I can't believe this. It's... 

    Sunset Shimmer 
    Amazing! 

    

    Twilight Sparkle 
    Terrible! 

    Sunset Shimmer Are you kidding? This is great! I mean, we've all ponied up before, gotten the whole ears and wings and tail thing, shot magical rainbow lasers, but nothing like this has ever happened! How did you do it? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know! Maybe I didn't. Maybe it's her! 
    Sunset Shimmer Her who? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nothing. Never mind. Can we just not talk about it? And could you please not bring this whole levitating thing up to the others? 
    Sunset Shimmer Why not? 
    Twilight Sparkle You heard Applejack. This is supposed to be the place where everyone can get away from magic. I don't want them to know I brought some crazy new kind with me. 
    Sunset Shimmer If you really don't want me to, I won't say anything. 
    Twilight Sparkle I really don't. 
    Sunset Shimmer Okay, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing!  
    Spike I think you're just gonna have to pick it up. 
    Sunset Shimmer Awww. 

    Gloriosa Daisy  â€”show up like that! 
    Sunset Shimmer What did you say? 
    Gloriosa Daisy I... didn't say anything. Just here to make sure everyone was headed over to the docks! Did you need something? 
    Sunset Shimmer Nope. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Because if there is anything I can do to make this week the best week ever, you just let me know. I've got this! 
    Sunset Shimmer Thanks, I'm good.  People that chipper make me nervous. 
    Pinkie Pie This is gonna be so much fun! 
    Sunset Shimmer I guess not all people. 

    Rarity Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? It looks like a diamond shining in the sun! 
    Fluttershy It is lovely out here. The fresh air, the cool breeze, the birds that land on your finger. 
    Rainbow Dash I think that only happens to you. 

    Gloriosa Daisy Lake activities are available every day until sunset, so if you want to canoe, sail, windsurf, or swim, just let me know. 
     
    Fluttershy Aren't they just the cutest? 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Timber Spruce Whoa! I know I'm charming, but you don't have to fall for me. 
    Flash Sentry  Guess I can't get too jealous, right? After all, she isn't my Twilight. Not that the other Twilight was mine! But we were... you know. 
    Sunset Shimmer Yeah. I get it. But your Twilight is a princess in Equestria. Hate to break it to you, but that's where she's gonna spend most of her time. 
    Flash Sentry So you're saying I just need to get over her? 
    Sunset Shimmer Kinda, yeah. 
    Flash Sentry Ouch. You're not pulling any punches. 
    Sunset Shimmer Not really my style. Sorry. 

    Vice Principal Luna This is a safety hazard. I suggest we close down the dock for the remainder of the camp. 
    Students  
    Gloriosa Daisy Oh, I'm sure it won't have to be for the remainder of camp. Just needs to be patched up a bit. I've got this! 
    Applejack Huh. Or maybe we do! If you ask me, this whole dock needs to go.  Building a new one could be our camp gift. Sure, it would benefit us, but a nice new dock would benefit future campers, too. 
    Students  
    Timber Spruce I don't know. It's an awful lot of work. I wouldn't want you guys to miss out on doing other fun camp stuff because you're so busy building a dock for future campers. 
     
    Rainbow Dash I hear what you're saying, Timber, but we're Canterlot Wondercolts. We've got a reputation to uphold! And there was no way we're gonna leave this place without contributing the most awesome camp gift ever! I'm with AJ. Building a new dock is definitely it! What do you guys think? 
    Students  
    Gloriosa Daisy  Looks like it's settled, then. 
    Timber Spruce  Looks like it. 
    Sunset Shimmer That's some tension, all right. 

    Twilight Sparkle We can reinforce the foundation. 
    Applejack Make it nice and sturdy. 
    Sunset Shimmer And we can add a wood-carved sign that says "Camp Everfree". 
    Fluttershy And little boxes with food so you can feed the ducks and fishies. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, we'll add lanterns so you can see at night! 
    Rarity  It's stunning! And will make an absolutely perfect runway for my camp fashion show! 
    Applejack More importantly, it will be a great place for docking canoes and feeding the wildlife. 
    Rarity Oh, you say "tomato", I say "perfect place to showcase glamorous boho-chic stylings". 
    Twilight Sparkle What do you guys think? 
    Principal Celestia It's going to be a lot of work, but we can do it! 
    Pinkie Pie Yes! Adult supervision! 

    Applejack Huh, nice hammer. Where did you get it? 
    Rainbow Dash Uh, duh. The toolbox? 
    Applejack Hah, that's cool. I made mine. 
    Rainbow Dash Ugh. 
    Twilight Sparkle Making lanterns out of solar-powered garden lights! Pretty crafty there, Timber! 
    Timber Spruce You think that's crafty? You should see my macaroni art. I'm like the Picasso of noodles. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Principal Celestia All right, now. You've made a lot of progress, but it's going to be getting dark soon. We can pick this up tomorrow between our other camp activities. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Everyone, get cleaned up, and we'll gather by the fire pit at eight to share s'mores and scary stories! 
    Pinkie Pie S'mores! 

    Rarity ...And that's when she looked down and realized she was wearing purple socks with a burgundy dress!  
    Students  
    Applejack Uh... that was a terrifying story. 
    Rainbow Dash  Yeah, I'm terrified she'll try to tell it again. 
    Vice Principal Luna  Anyone else have a spooky story? 
    Timber Spruce I have one. But I'm warning you, you might as well hug a friend now. That's how scary it is! 
    Fluttershy  
    Spike  
    Fluttershy Oh, dear. 
    Bulk Biceps  
    Timber Spruce It's time I told you about the legend of Gaea Everfree. 

    Timber Spruce  Many years ago, my great-grandparents came to this forest. Seeing its beauty, they decided that it would be the perfect place for a camp. But once they started building, strange things started to happen. One pitch black night, when the wind was howling, a tree branch crashed through the roof of their cabin! They screamed and ran outside, only to see the giant creature rising from the earth! She had wild hair like the roots of a tree. Her mouth had jagged rock teeth and her eyes were pools of black tar. But her aura shimmered like diamonds. Anywhere she went, she left a trail of gem dust in her wake. Trembling, my great-grandparents asked who she was and what she wanted. In a deep and hollow voice, she told them that her name was Gaea Everfree â€“ an ancient spirit who held domain over the forest, and that my great-grandparents were trespassing on her land. They begged her to let them stay and build their camp, to share this wonderful place with others. Gaea Everfree finally agreed but warned them that they would not be able to keep it forever. Someday, she will return and reclaim the forest as her own. 

    Timber Spruce So if you see a trail of gem dust, you'll know that it is...  Gaea Everfree! 
    Students  
    Gloriosa Daisy Hey, guys! Sorry, didn't mean to scare you! 
    Sunset Shimmer Then why'd you come out of the bushes? 
    Gloriosa Daisy I... took the scenic route, because the forest is beautiful at night. But no one else should do it without a guide, kay? All right, everybody, time to head to your tents. 
    Snips Oh, hey, Gloriosa. Do you have extra toothbrushes? I forgot mine. 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Sure do! I'll get one for you. 
    Snails  I'm scared of the dark! Do you have flashlights? 
    Gloriosa Daisy Of course! I got this! 
    Spike  Fluttershy? 
    Fluttershy Sorry, Spike. I guess that story got to me. 
    Applejack Why? It can't be real. 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know. Gaea Everfree could be some creature that got booted from Equestria and ended up in this world. That's what happened with the sirens. 
    Applejack Eh. Sounded more like something that Timber was makin' up just to scare us. At least I hope it was. Last thing I want is to have camp ruined by some power-crazed magical creature. 
    Rarity Oh, hear-hear. We've had to deal with more than our fair share of those. At the Fall Formal, a musical showcase, the Friendship Gaâ€” Well, I mean, you know, everything turned out all right, of course  
    Twilight Sparkle Mmm. I'm kinda tired. I'm gonna turn in. 
    Sunset Shimmer Maybe lay off bringing up what happened at the Friendship Games? I think she's still pretty sensitive about it. 
    Pinkie Pie  Our lips are sealed. 

    Spike  
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Midnight Sparkle Here I am! Over here. I'm always here! 

    Twilight Sparkle No! 
    Sunset Shimmer  What happened? 
    Twilight Sparkle Nothing. Sorry, Sunset. 
    Sunset Shimmer Uh, Twilight, I think something happened. 
    Twilight Sparkle  
     
    Spike  Is it time to get up already? 
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, we really have to talk about this. 
    Twilight Sparkle No, we don't! 

    Derpy  
     
    Sunset Shimmer Hey, I know you don't want to, but I really think we need to figure out what's going on with your magic. If you could learn to control itâ€” 
    Twilight Sparkle But that's just it! I'll never be able to control it! 
     
    Rainbow Dash What happened? 
    Twilight Sparkle I didn't mean to! 
    Sunset Shimmer We didn't see anything, so we don't know what happened. 

    Sunset Shimmer Are you okay? 
    Sandalwood Yeah. It was so weird. We were stuck in a middle of the lake with no wind, then all of a sudden, bam! The wind picked up, and we were pushed right into the dock. 
    Pinkie Pie  You don't think it was the spirit, do you?! 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, it was me. 
    Trixie Spirit, show yourself! The Great and Powerful Trixie commands it! 
    Rarity What's that?! 
    Students  
    Rainbow Dash Oh, man! All our hard work! Ruined! 
    Fluttershy At least the fishies are eating well. 
    Sunset Shimmer Let's salvage what we can out of the water. Maybe we can still fix this. 
    Rarity We have to try! Camp Everfree needs a runway! 
    Applejack Dock. 
    Rarity Dock. Yes. That's what I meant. 

    

        It used to be so simple 
        It was a world I understood 
        I didn't know what I didn't know 
        And life seemed pretty good 

        But now the darkness rises 
        From somewhere deep inside of me 
        Her power overtakes me 
        Can I keep this midnight from getting free? 

        If I can stay with the light 
        I know I'll be free 
        And I can start to be whole 
        I can start to be me 

        But instead I am struggling 
        With all that I see 
        And these friends 
        Mustn't see the midnight in me! 
        The midnight in me! 

        They mustn't see the midnight in me... 

    Spike  So many squirrels... 
    Sunset Shimmer Spike? 
    Spike Ah! Oh. Aw, man! I was having the best dream. Wait. That dream could be a reality! 
    Sunset Shimmer Before you run off to chase squirrels, do you have any idea where Twilight could be? I really need to talk to her. 
    Spike What happened? Did she do that lifting things off the ground thing again? 
    Sunset Shimmer That's just it. I don't know if it was her. But if it was, we need to deal with it head on. 
    Spike I can track her down. 

    Twilight Sparkle Keep it together. Deep breaths. You are not a monster. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Timber Spruce  
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, hi.  What are you doing here? 
    Timber Spruce Uh... Looking for you. 
    Twilight Sparkle Oh, I just went on a nature walk and got a little lost. 
    Timber Spruce Let me show you the way. I'm kind of an expert at these woods. I've lived here my whole life. 
    Twilight Sparkle That must have been nice. Growing up at a camp. 
    Timber Spruce Yeah, though it has its downsides. When I was younger, I wished we'd sell this place so we could live in a town like normal people. 
    Twilight Sparkle Really? 
    Timber Spruce I was ten. I really wanted to hang out at the mall. 
    Twilight Sparkle and Timber Spruce  
    Timber Spruce I've never told that to anyone. You must be special.  And not just because you have tree branch in your hair. 
    Twilight Sparkle Ugh. How long has that been in there? 
    Timber Spruce Not long. Just the whole time we were talking. 
    Twilight Sparkle  Well, why didn't you say something? 
    Sunset Shimmer  I guess we can help Twilight deal with the magic stuff a little later. 

    Principal Celestia Rock climbing is all about perseverance and trust. Rarity, you can trust that Applejack will spot you. 
    Rainbow Dash Yeah, so you can totally go faster than you're going. 
    Applejack Rainbow Dash! 
    Rainbow Dash Sorry. I've been waiting to do this since we got here. 
    Rarity Well, you have to wait a little longer, darling. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, good! Twilight, if you spot me, I can finally go. I'll go get another harness. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm not sureâ€” 
    Timber Spruce I better make sure my sister doesn't need anything. See you later? 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, there you are! I was looking for you! 
    [rumble, 
    Students  
    Spike Was that an earthquake? 
    Twilight Sparkle We aren't near any fault lines. 
    Bulk Biceps Hey! Who left this crystaly dusty stuff here?! 
    Rarity  I-I believe I'd like to come down now! 
    Applejack  Sorry, it's a little bit stuck. 
    Rarity  Applejack! What are you doing?! 
    Principal Celestia Is everything okay over there? 
    Applejack Uh, I don't know what happened. I didn't even pull the rope that hard. It's like she was light as a feather all of a sudden. 
    Rarity  I was scared half to death! 
    Applejack It wasn't my fault! Let me help you get your harness out. 
    Rarity No, thank you! 
    Applejack  
    Principal Celestia What in the world just happened?! 
    Rarity Oh, dear! I am so sorry! I think. Did I just do whatever that was? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think it was your fault. I gonna go get Applejack a towel. 
    Sunset Shimmer Me, too.  You're not the only one with a new kind of magic! This is great! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, it's not! Rarity and Applejack could have really hurt each other! Why is this happening? I don'tâ€” 
    Gloriosa Daisy Hi, girls! Anything I can do for you? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh, Applejack just fell into the lake! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Oh, no! She's gonna need warm towels, dry clothes, oh, and a hot cocoa! I've got this! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer Fluttershy? 
    Sunset Shimmer What happened?! 
    Fluttershy I don't know. We were just decorating cookies andâ€” 
    Pinkie Pie And I was all, "You need more sprinkles! And you need more sprinkles!" 
    Sunset Shimmer So, standard Pinkie Pie stuff. 
    Pinkie Pie I was just tossing sprinkles to Fluttershy, when all of a sudden they glowed pink and exploded! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Just like that, only earlier! 
    Sunset Shimmer Oookaay. Why don't you lay off touching stuff for a while? 
    Fluttershy Oh, dear. We really should clean all of this up.  Can someone help me out? 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy Thank you, Mr. Bird. 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy Why, of course I can get you a little something toâ€”  Did you just... talk? 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy But I don't speak "chirp". 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy I don't know if you're the only bird I can understand. 
    Constance  
    Fluttershy Oh, no! Please don't call for your friends. 
     
    Fluttershy It's nice to meet all of you, too. 
    Sunset Shimmer Were you just talking to the birds? 
     
    Fluttershy Um, yes? 
     
    Fluttershy  
     
    Applejack Did you tell them what happened? So crazy! I hoisted Rarity up the rock climbin' wall like it was nothin'! Like I had way more strength than I usually do. 
    Rarity And I made a diamondy thing appear out of nowhere, which normally I'd be excited about. I mean, the facets were just perfect, and theâ€” 
    Applejack Rarity! 
    Rarity Oh, sorry. It knocked Applejack over and then it disappeared! 
    Applejack Speaking of disappearing, has anybody seen Rainbow Dash? 
     
    Rainbow Dash  Ow! 
    Applejack Whoa! How'd you do that? 
    Rainbow Dash I don't know. I started running to get the harness, and the next thing I knew, I was practically back in town! 
    Rarity But if you had some sort of super speed, why you were gone for so long? 
    Rainbow Dash Because I lost it when I got far away. And then it came back when I got close to camp. 
    Pinkie Pie  Being at camp is giving us all new magical abilities! 
    Sunset Shimmer Not all of us have gotten new abilities. I haven't, but Twilightâ€” ...hasn't, either. 
    Applejack  So much for my theory that leavin' CHS would mean leavin' any new magic business behind. 
    Sunset Shimmer Something at the camp must be making this happen. 
    Fluttershy Um, Gaea Everfree? 
     
    Fluttershy  
    Gloriosa Daisy Applejack! I was looking for you! Here, I brought you some towels and dry clothes. Uh, what happened in here? 
    Sunset Shimmer We're kinda trying to figure that out. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Well, don't worry about it. I got this! 
    Sandalwood Gloriosa, I kicked my beanbag into the lake! 
    Gloriosa Daisy  I'll get you another one! 
    Derpy And I'm all out of arrows! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Say no more! New arrows coming right up! 
    Timber Spruce There you are!  Filthy Rich is back. Do you want me to handle it? 
    Gloriosa Daisy  
    Sunset Shimmer Fluttershy, enough with the screaming! 
    Fluttershy I didn't scream. 
    Rainbow Dash For once. 
    Rarity Nobody did. 
    Sunset Shimmer Huh? 
    Principal Celestia  Attention, campers! Anyone who's interested in making floating paper lanterns, please meet us by the picnic tables. 
    Applejack I don't know about the rest of y'all, but I've been lookin' forward to comin' here for a month. Maybe we forget about this "new magic" for a bit and just try to focus on enjoyin' our time at camp? 
    Rarity I was oh, so excited about designs I've come up with for the camp fashion show. 
    Rainbow Dash And I've barely gotten to whoop anybody in tetherball. 
    Sunset Shimmer I think we should try to figure it out. But if letting it go for now is what the rest of you want... 
    Everybody sans Sunset and Twilight  
    Pinkie Pie Abso-tootly-lutely! 

    Rarity Um, Pinkie Pie, what are you doing? 
    Pinkie Pie Putting marshmallows in my lantern. Then when we light them, mine will be beautiful and delicious! 
    Spike Hey, Twilight, why aren't you with everyone else? 
    Twilight Sparkle Sunset said something at camp is causing the other girls to get new magic. I think it's Midnight Sparkle. She's still part of me. I can feel it. And I think her magic is infecting my friends. 
    Spike What are we gonna do? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't know what I can do. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Okay, everyone! It's time to watch your lanterns fly! 
    Timber Spruce Hey, cool lantern! Mine's my face! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Timber Spruce Uh, you okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm. 
    Timber Spruce You don't seem like yourself tonight. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Ready? And... go! 
     
    Pinkie Pie Aw! Oh, well! Now I get to eat it!  Yep, beautiful and delicious. 

     
     
    Sunset Shimmer  Twilight? Twilight! Where is she going? 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight? What are you doing out here? 
    Twilight Sparkle We're... we're meeting a cab to take us home. 
    Spike She thought you'd talk her out of it. 
    Sunset Shimmer Because I would. Twilight, you can't leave. 
     

    Pinkie Pie You don't think it was the spirit, do you?! 
    Twilight Sparkle  No, it was me. 

    Twilight Sparkle I think it's Midnight Sparkle. She's still part of me. I can feel it. And I think her magic is infecting my friends. 

    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, there's no Midnight Sparkle. There's only you. 
    Twilight Sparkle How did you know what I was thinking? 
    Sunset Shimmer When I touched your hand, I could see things. I could understand why you were leaving. My new magic...! This is my new magic! This is incredible! 
    Twilight Sparkle No, it's not! I'm infecting you now! 
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, you have to stop looking at this as a bad thing. 
    Twilight Sparkle Easy for you to say. Magic turned you into something beautiful. The last time I tried to use it, it turned me into a monster. I'm just so afraid it's gonna happen again. 
    Sunset Shimmer Yes, last time I turned into something amazing, but I've let magic turn me into a monster, too. So if anyone understands what you're going through, it's me. I can help you, Twilight. And the rest of our friends can be there for you, too. But not if you run away. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I'll stay. But I still don't think it's a good idea for me to be near the rest of our friends right now. Not until we know why this is happening. 
    Sunset Shimmer Understood. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer What was that?! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer  
    Timber Spruce  Wait. Twilight? 
    Twilight Sparkle Timber? I'm so glad it's just you! Wait, what are you doing out here? 
    Sunset Shimmer With an axe? 
    Timber Spruce I was chopping down firewood. 
    Sunset Shimmer In the middle of the night? 
    Timber Spruce We needed more for tomorrow night's campfire. And if I didn't take care of it tonight, it would be one more thing Gloriosa would add to her list.  I've got this! 
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Timber Spruce What about you two? Why are you hanging out in the woods in the middle of the night? 
    Sunset Shimmer Oh! I was sleepwalking. Twilight found me and was bringing me back to camp. 
    Twilight Sparkle Mm-hmm. 
    Timber Spruce Come on. I'll walk you guys back. I'll protect you from  Gaea Everfree! Everfree! Everfree! 
    Sunset Shimmer Come on. That's obviously just a spooky story you made up to tell around the campfire. 
    Timber Spruce Oh, no. It's legit. How else would you explain what happened at the docks? And that weird thing where the earth shook? Come on. I know a shortcut back to the tents. 
     
    Sunset Shimmer Legit, huh? I think we just found our "Gaea Everfree". 
    Spike But why would he work so hard to make us think she was real? 
    Sunset Shimmer You heard what he said about wishing his sister would sell this camp. If nobody wants to come here because it's home to some angry ancient nature spirit, it sure would help his cause. 
    Spike We should tell Twilight. 
    Sunset Shimmer Not yet. She's obviously going through a lot right now. We should probably be a hundred percent sure before we tell her the guy she likes is a jerk who's trying to run everybody out of camp. 
    Spike Uh-huh! 

     
     
    Rainbow Dash Phew! Uh, you gonna give us a hand here, Rarity? 
    Rarity Oh, I'd love to, but I really need to get the stitching on this poncho done if it's going to make it into the camp fashion show. Though at the pace you two are moving, I don't know that the runway will ever be finished. 
    Applejack The dock is our gift to the camp, and it's gonna get finished. That is, if Rainbow Dash would hurry up and bring me more wood. 
    Rainbow Dash Oh, I can't go any faster! I don't want to end up in the woods again. 
    Applejack Don't be silly. 
    Rainbow Dash Really? 
    Applejack  I know I said we should try to forget all about this new magic business, but I can't. What if I hammer the board into splinters? 
    Rarity, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash  
    Applejack Aw, shoot! I'm all out of nails. 
    Pinkie Pie Oh, here you go! 
    Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash Pinkie, no!  
    Applejack  
    Pinkie Pie What? Ohhh, did you think the nails would explode like the sprinkles? Wow! Glad that didn't happen, huh? 
    Rarity  Sorry, girls. I didn't mean to. I don't know how to control this. 
    Rainbow Dash It's okay. 
    Fluttershy Oh, none of us do. 
    Sunset Shimmer Which is why we shouldn't pretend this isn't happening. 
    Rainbow Dash Do you have them now, too? 
    Sunset Shimmer It started last night. When I touch people, it's like I can feel what they're feeling and see their memories. 
    Pinkie Pie Oooh, fancy! Try me, try me! 

     
    Pinkie Pie La-la-la-la. Ooh, taffy! 

    Sunset Shimmer That explains so much. 
    Pinkie Pie Yep. 
    Sunset Shimmer Girls, we can't just brush these powers aside because it doesn't seem like the ideal time to get them. What if it turns out that they could actually make things better? 

    

        So you have magic 
        And it's not that great 
        But when it found you 
        You know it was fate 

        And it might seem scary now 
        But it can be wonderful, too 
        So how about we embrace the magic 
        And make the magic part of you? 

        You take a little dash of magic 
        And you let it ignite 
        Mix things up a little bit 
        And it might start to go right 

        In just five seconds flat 
        How the story has changed 
        All 'cause now you've embraced the magic 
        And it just got better in every way 

        I say embrace the magic 
        No more holding back, just let it out 
        If you can take the magic 
        And learn a little more what it can do 
        Once the magic is part of you 

        What's standing in your way 
        That you can't move today? 
        You've got the strength in you 
        To make your dreams come true 

        No need to shield yourself 
        From the magic that can help 
        Protect from any harm that might come 

        So you have magic 
        And it's not that great 
        But when it found you 
        You know it was fate 

        So if you listen close 
        You might make a new friend 
        And together we can make it! 

        I say embrace the magic 
        No more holding back, just let it out 
        If you can take the magic 
        And learn a little more what it can do 
        Once the magic is part of you 
        Once the magic is part of you 
        Once the magic is part of you 

        Once the magic is part of you 

    Rainbow Dash Okay, that was pretty awesome! 
    Sunset Shimmer And look what you managed to accomplish! 
    Rarity Please, please, please can we do a run-through for the fashion show on it right this minute? 
    Applejack Thought you weren't finished with the stitching on your poncho. 
    Rarity I am now. 
    Sunset Shimmer Get started without me. I've gotta go find Twilight. Seeing what we've been able to do here might make her embrace the new magic, too! Uh, not that she has any. 

    Gloriosa Daisy  I just wish you didn't tell them that ridiculous story! 
    Timber Spruce Ah, this is all too much for you! You have to let it go! 
    Sunset Shimmer  I knew it! He wants her to get rid of the camp! 
     
     
     
    Sunset Shimmer and Flash Sentry Ugh! 
    Flash Sentry Sunset Shimmer? What were you doing behind that door? 
    Sunset Shimmer What? Um, nothing! I, um, lost an earring. Uh, there it is! 
    Flash Sentry Hey, listen. I'm glad I ran into you. I really wanted to thank you. 
    Sunset Shimmer For what? 
    Flash Sentry For the tough love. Telling me I should get over Twilight. I needed to hear that. 
    Sunset Shimmer Sure, no problem. 
    Flash Sentry Is something wrong? 
    Sunset Shimmer What? No. Why? 
    Flash Sentry Come on, Sunset. We used to date. I know when something's bothering you. 
    Sunset Shimmer  Okay, here's the deal. My friend really likes someone, but I don't think that someone is who she thinks they are. I don't wanna upset my friend by telling her what I think, because I also want to protect her, because if what I think is happening is really happening, then she deserves to know. You know? 
    Flash Sentry Nnnno. But what I do know is that your friend is lucky to have someone like you to look out for them. 
    Sunset Shimmer Really? 
    Flash Sentry Yeah. You know, you've changed a lot since we went out. You're so much... nicer. 
    Sunset Shimmer Thanks. I'm glad you noticed. 
    Flash Sentry Uh, look, maybe you and me, we could start over as... friends. 
    Sunset Shimmer Uh, uh, sounds great. I gotta go! 
    Flash Sentry Cool, yeah! I want to start over later, too! Hah. 

     
     
    Sunset Shimmer Ah, shoot! He's definitely up to something! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle It's Sunset. She says to meet her by the rock quarry. 
    Spike I thought we weren't supposed to hike out that far. 
    Twilight Sparkle She says it's important! 

     
    Twilight Sparkle What is that?  
    Sunset Shimmer Shhh! 

    Twilight Sparkle What's going on down there? 
    Sunset Shimmer I think it's Gaea Everfree. Or rather, someone who wants us to think she's back. C'mon! Whoa... 
    Twilight Sparkle This place is beautiful. 
    Sunset Shimmer There's Equestrian magic here. I can... I can feel it. 
    Spike Wait. I thought Timber was just faking there was a magical nature creature. Are you saying it's real? 
    Twilight Sparkle Timber? What does he have to do with any of this? 
    Gloriosa Daisy  Nothing. It's all me. 
    Sunset Shimmer Gloriosa? But... Timber. I was sure he was the one trying to make it seem like Gaea Everfree was back. It was you who was trying to scare everyone away? 
    Gloriosa Daisy I would never try to scare anyone away from Camp Everfree. 
     

    Filthy Rich My, oh, my. You fell behind on your payments, Gloriosa. I own the land now. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Please. My great grandparents founded this place. It's been in our family for generations! You have to let the camp stay! 
    Filthy Rich Instead of turning it into a spa resort that will line my pockets with more money than this camp ever could?  I don't think so. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Please! I-I-I-I just need a little more time! 
    Filthy Rich Fine. I'll give you 'til the end of the month. Hmph. 
    Gloriosa Daisy  

    Gloriosa Daisy What'll I do?  
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Huh? 
     
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Oof.  Wow! 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy  
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Oof. 

    Timber Spruce You don't know what those things are! 
    Gloriosa Daisy But I know what they can do! I've been practicing! I can control their power now! 
    Timber Spruce You don't know that for sure! 
    Gloriosa Daisy This is our camp, and it's being taken away! If this has to be our last week here, I'm going to use whatever it takes to make it count! 

    Derpy  
     
     
     

     
     
     

    Timber Spruce You were using magic all over the place! I had to tell them something to cover for you! What did you want me to do?! 
    Gloriosa Daisy I just wish you didn't tell them that ridiculous story! 
    Timber Spruce Ah, this is all too much for you! You have to let it go! 

    Sunset Shimmer Timber wasn't talking about letting go of the camp. He was talking about you letting go of the magical geodes! All those things you were doing to make this week the best week ever. Every time you used magic to do them, you caused another problem somewhere else! Timber was... covering for you! 
    Gloriosa Daisy How do you know what I was doing with the geodes? How do you know about the magic? 
    Sunset Shimmer I can see things. Feel things. Because I have magic, too. And so does she. And so do our friends. 
    Twilight Sparkle Gloriosa, Timber wasn't wrong. Maybe you should stop using magic. Too much of it can be dangerous if you can't control it. 
    Gloriosa Daisy Oh, I got this. And I'm going to use it to save my camp. I just need more power! 
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer No! 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Sorry, girls. I know what I need to do. But I feel like we're not on the same page. So... 
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer  Gloriosa! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer No! 

     
    Rarity Where are Twilight and Sunset?  they're missing our dress rehearsal. 
    Pinkie Pie Uh-uh. 
    Rarity I suppose we can get started without them. Whenever you're ready! 
     
    Rarity Hmm. Told you you'd like it. 
    Applejack It's alright... I guess. I do get to keep it after camp though, right? 

     
     
    Snails She looks... different. 
    Snips Yeah. She looks... taller. 

    Rarity This is only a preview. I've got another entire line I'll debut at the real thing. 
     
    Rarity Why did you stop theâ€”?  Oh, my goodness! 
    Gloriosa Daisy Attention, campers! 
    Trixie It's Gaea Everfree! 
    Flash Sentry She's real! 
    Bulk Biceps Aah! We're doomed! 
    Timber Spruce Gloriosa?! What are you doing?! 
    Applejack That's Gloriosa? Am I goin' crazy, or are her feet not touchin' the ground? 
    Pinkie Pie Freaky-deaky! 
    Gloriosa Daisy I have an announcement to make! Filthy Rich wants this to be the last session of Camp Everfree. But don't worry, I've got this! 
     
     
    Rainbow Dash Oh, come on! We literally just finished building that! 

    

        I have waited for the day 
        To send this greedy wolf away 
        Now the magic is my salvation 
        Gather close in my protection 

        We... will... stand for Everfree! 

        Behold the beauty of nature in all its glory 
        No need to fear the vultures at the door 
        Right here you have me to protect you 
        Within these walls of thorns 
        Forever free, forevermore! 

        They have come into our domain 
        Here to seal our camp in chains 
        But we have held it for generations 
        This is just a complication 

        We... will... stand for Everfree! 

        Trust in me, this is for your own good 
        Don't be afraid, nature is our friend 
        All of this beauty that surrounds us 
        Every lovely bloom designed to defend 

        Let them come, just let them try! 
        I'm not about to say goodbye! 
        This camp will be here throughout the ages 
        Written into the history pages 

        We... will... stand for Everfree! 

    Fluttershy Oh, why do these kinds of things always happen to us? 
    Rarity What are we going to do? 
    Rainbow Dash What we always do! Save the day! 
    The Equestria Girls  
    Pinkie Pie Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! This is gonna be so much fun! I only wish we had time to make superhero capes! 
    Rarity Oh, me, too! 
    Rainbow Dash  Enough about our wardrobe! We've got to stop Gloriosa from trapping everybody in here! 
     
     
    Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops  
     
    Rarity  
     
     
    Fluttershy Um, hi. Do you think you can give us a handâ€” um, er, paw? We could really use a way out. 
     
     
    Applejack  Hmph. 
     
     
     
    Applejack  
    Rainbow Dash  
     
     
    Applejack This isn't working! Her magic is too strong! 

    Spike  
    Sunset Shimmer Nice work, Spike!  Twilight, you have to use your magic! 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't think I can lift something that big. 
    Sunset Shimmer It's our only chance of getting out of here and helping our friends! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  

    Gloriosa Daisy Why are you fighting me?! I'm doing this to save our camp! I'm doing this for you! 
    Rarity  Gloriosa, let's just think about this for a moment, shall we? I mean, I think Camp Everfree is absolutely delightful, but I just don't know that I'm quite ready to give up my weekly trips to the spa. 
    Gloriosa Daisy  To the spa?! 
    Rainbow Dash  
     
    Timber Spruce Gloriosa, this isn't the way! 
    Gloriosa Daisy I appreciate your concern, Timber, but I got this! 
    Timber Spruce Agh! No, you don't! 

    Sunset Shimmer  Twilight, do you think you can use your magic? 
    Twilight Sparkle I don't want to use too much. Midnight Sparkle could take over. 
    Sunset Shimmer Twilight, our friends are in there! 
    Twilight Sparkle Okay. 

    Timber Spruce Please, Gloriosa! What you're doing is crazy! You have to listen to me! 
    Sunset Shimmer That isn't Gloriosa. 
    Rarity Twilight! 
    Applejack Sunset! 
    Rainbow Dash You're okay! 
    Sunset Shimmer That isn't your sister. It's someone who's been consumed by Equestrian magic. 
    Timber Spruce Whoever you are, you have to let my sister go! Please, Gloriosa, come back! I need you! Gloriosa! 
     
    Twilight Sparkle  
    Applejack Rarity! 
    Rarity  I can't keep this up forever! 
    Sunset Shimmer  It's up to you. You can use your magic to pull the brambles apart! 
    Twilight Sparkle No. There's too many of them. It would take too much magic. I can't! 
    Sunset Shimmer It's the only way! You have to embrace the magic inside you! 
    Twilight Sparkle What if she takes over? What if instead of saving everyone, I turn into Midnight Sparkle and only make things worse? 
    Sunset Shimmer That won't happen! We won't let it. 
     
     
    Rarity Agh! 
    Sunset Shimmer Come on, Twilight! You have to be stronger than she is! 

    Midnight Sparkle  You will never control me! I will always be a part of you! 
    Twilight Sparkle  Noooo! 
    Sunset Shimmer's voice Twilight, listen to me! You are in charge! 
    Rarity's voice You are a light, darling! A force for good! 
    Rainbow Dash's voice Yeah! You can kick the darkness's butt! 
    Pinkie Pie's voice We're here for you, Twilight! 
    Applejack's voice And we'll be here, no matter what! 
    Fluttershy's voice We believe in you! 
    Sunset Shimmer's voice You... are not... Midnight Sparkle! 
    Twilight Sparkle No! I... am... Twilight Sparkle! And the magic I carry inside me is... the Magic of Friendship! 

     
    Gloriosa Daisy No! Stop! 
     
     
    Timber Spruce Gloriosa? 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy What... What happened? 
    Timber Spruce It's okay. It's gonna be okay. 
     
    Spike You did it! Whoa. Nice bling. 
    Applejack What... What are these? 
    Sunset Shimmer I'm not sure. But clearly we have some kind of connection to them. 
    Rarity I almost don't care what they are. They are gorgeous!  That's probably cancelled, isn't it? 

    Gloriosa Daisy I am so sorry. I only wanted this to be the best week Camp Everfree has ever had, and instead I've made it the worst. Maybe it's for the best that I'm losing the camp to Filthy Rich. 
    Principal Celestia No. It's not. This camp has meant so much to so many people, my sister and me included. 
    Vice Principal Luna Why do you think we wanted our students to come here? 
    Twilight Sparkle We can't let Filthy Rich take this place away! If camp meant so much to you two, maybe it meant as much to the other campers who came here in years past. 
    Sunset Shimmer And maybe we can get them to help save it! 
    Applejack Oh! Like a fundraiser? 
    Rarity Or a ball?! 
    Rainbow Dash Our band could play! 
    Fluttershy I could help write a new song just for the occasion! 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Those are all good ideas, but where would we hold it? 
    Sunset Shimmer We could hold it in the crystal cave! 
    Rarity  A Crystal Ball! I love it! 
    Gloriosa Daisy I admire everyone's enthusiasm. Really, I do. But I-I just don't know how we're going to plan a ball by tomorrow and invite everyone. 
    Equestria Girls We got this! 

    

        I used to think that stories were just that 
        Set in stone, concrete as a fact 
        It didn't dawn on me 
        That I could change history 

    

        Now I know I'm writing my own song 
        Fight my way to the ending that I want 
        I'll turn a tragedy 

    

        Into an epic fantasy 

    

        Hey, hey, hey 
        You can be a hero (hero) too 
        Oh-oh-oh 
        Take my hand, I'm here for you 

        Come away with me 
        Be the legend you were meant to be 
        You'll always be Everfree 

        Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah 
        To be the legend you were meant to be 
        Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah 
        To be the legend you were meant to be 

    

        There was a time when fear would hold me down 
        'Cause I let it chain me to the ground 

    

        Look at me now, I'm soaring high 
        It's never boring in the sky 

    

        When I know I've got friends on my side 
        Whatever trials, I'll take them all in stride 

    

        Together we will shine so bright 
        A radiant brilliance in the night 

    

        Hey, hey, hey 
        You can be a hero (hero) too 
        Oh-oh-oh 
        Take my hand, I'm here for you 

        Come away with me 
        Be the legend you were meant to be 
        You'll always be Everfree 

        Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah 
        To be the legend you were meant to be 
        Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah 
        To be the legend you were meant to be! 

     
    Gloriosa Daisy Thank you all so much for coming! And for helping us raise enough money to... save Camp Everfree! 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy  Thank you. For everything. Oh, if I'd just asked for help in the first place... 
    Rainbow Dash Hey, don't sweat it, it's kinda what we do. 

     
    Timber Spruce Not to brag or anything, but it's pretty cool how I saved all those campers from those Rubus fruticosus. 
     
    Timber Spruce Blackberry brambles. 
    Twilight Sparkle I'm familiar with the genus. It's just a little weird you say you saved the campers. I thought I saved them. 
    Timber Spruce Yeah. But I saved you from falling on the docks so that you could save the campers. So technically, it was all me. 
    Twilight Sparkle  I'm really glad I met you. 
    Timber Spruce Uh-oh. 
    Twilight Sparkle What? 
    Timber Spruce That sounds like a goodbye. And here I was hoping we'd still be able to hang out. Maybe get dinner and catch a movie? 
    Twilight Sparkle Yeah. I'd really like that. 
    Timber Spruce Oh, good! I was hoping that's what this meant. 
     
    Gloriosa Daisy Oh, uh...  Sorry. I need to borrow Timber. There are some donors I really want him to meet. They were good friends with Mom and Dad. 
    Timber Spruce Save me a dance, okay? 
    Twilight Sparkle Uh-huh. 
    Rarity Adorable. 
    Sunset Shimmer He does seem like a pretty cool guy. 
    Rainbow Dash You know what else is cool? Our awesome new superpowers! 
     
    Rainbow Dash I handed out, like, four hundred fliers, set up the stage, and still had time to pick up pizza! I love my super-speed! 
    Sunset Shimmer About that. I think the crystals are the source of the superpowers. 
    Fluttershy You're not gonna ask us to give them up, are you? 
    Sunset Shimmer No. In fact, I think maybe we were meant to have them all along. 
    Twilight Sparkle Me, too. 
    The Equestria Girls  

     
    Sunset Shimmer There is one thing I'm still wondering about, though. 
    Twilight Sparkle What's that? 
    Sunset Shimmer Where did the magic that hit this cave come from? 
     

    

        Somewhere's a book 
        With chapters still blank 

    

        Insi-i-ide 

    

        It's the book of our lives 
        And the story is ours 

    

        To write 

    

        Ours to write 

    

        Some pages fade 
        While others are black 

    

        And whi-i-ite 

    

        And the story begins 
        Again every time 

    

        We try 

    

        Every time we try 

    

        And hope shines eternal 
        And friends are all I need (Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie All I need) 
        And hope shines eternal (Twilight Sparkle Shines eternal) 
        And the future is always bri-i-i-ight 
        When you're here with me 

    

        I've fought through the darkness 
        And come out the 

    

        Other si-i-ide 

    

        For rain clouds will clear 
        The way for the 

    

        Sunny sky 

    

        Way for the sunny sky-y-y 

    

        I've been afraid 
        And stayed through the longest 

    

        Ni-i-ight 

    

        Through the longest ni-i-ight 

    

        But morning still comes 
        And with it, it brings 

    

        A light 

    

        Oh, it brings a li-i-ight 

    

        And hope shines eternal 
        And friends are all I need (Sunset Shimmer Yeah, they're all I need) 
        And hope shines eternal (Applejack Shines eternal) 
        And the future is always bri-i-i-ight 
        The future is always bri-i-ight 
        Yeah, the future is always bri-i-i-ight 
        When you're here with me 

    Rainbow Dash Third time is a charm. Or is it fifth? I've lost track. 
    Rarity All that matters is that the runway is finished. 
    Applejack I think you mean the "dock"? 
    Rarity Oh, to-mah-to, tomato. 
    Pinkie Pie Let's celebrate! 
     
    Rarity
